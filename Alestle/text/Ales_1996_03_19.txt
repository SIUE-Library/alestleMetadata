Senator Hobson blindly proposes fee cuts
Hobson offers a motion to take student fees away from Student Publication in effort to fire director
By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
Randy Hobson has w ritten a m otion to be presented for
discussion at the student senate m eeting March 29 regarding the
elim ination of the position of D irector of Student Publications.
Hobson said the reasoning behind this proposal is due to his
observation of the paper in the last few months.
“O ver the last few m onths I have noticed many errors in
stories and basic inform ation put out by the new spaper and I
have had the opportunity to talk with both Roy Gilmore
(Editor-in-Chief) and Terry Signorello (D irector of Student
Publications) regarding these m istakes,” Hobson said.
“Terry’s answer to my questions have been that he has no
control and no responsibility over the content of the new spaper
and the basic idea behind all of this is if he does not feel that he
should be advising Roy when things go wrong we might better
use m oney being spent for his salary to pay for other things,”
H obson said.
H obson also said if the new spaper is none of Signorello’s
business, then we need to spend the student fee money in a
b etter way.

H obson added that he feels that Signorello is not giving good
guidance in controlling reporters, and is lacking in training and
the retaining of reporters.
Signorello said he does not know what m otivated Hobson to
m ake such a proposal and for all practical purposes thought he
was on the sam e wavelength since they had been working on
the idea of a campus yearbook together. Hobson, during the
February 23 senate meeting, applauded the efforts of the
Publication Staff in trying to bring back the yearbook.
Signorello also said that he does not know if it was an election
stunt, but the two had exchanged words over a particular article
three weeks prior to the writing of the proposal, although he did
not feel that the exchange was that significant.

• Negotiators for General Motors Corp. and a striking United Auto

strike that has shut down GM production across North America.
Both sides have refused to indicate whether any progress has been made.
It is the longest sustained communication since 2,700 workers walked out
March 5, primarily over the issue of outsourcing—the production of parts by
outside plants or companies. The union fears the practice could eliminate GM
jobs. The automaker says outsourcing, because it can be cheaper, is necessary
to remain competitive.

Attacks by Tamil rebels leave 19 dead
• Tamil rebels attacked a police outpost and a military camp in northeast Sri
Lanka, sparking clashes that killed at least 11 policemen and soldiers and eight
rebels, the military said Sunday.
Five policemen were killed and 11 were injured in Saturday night’s attack on
the police post in the Polonnaruwa district, about 120 miles from the capital of
Colombo. Rebel casualties were not known.
Earlier Saturday, rebels attacked a military camp in the Halamewewa
village, about 140 miles from the capital, killing six soldiers. Troops retaliated
with mortar and artillery fire, killing at least eight rebels.
The Tamil Tiger rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for Tamils.

Check facts before
drawing conclusion
about ID Center
This is a letter in response to a letter to the
editor w ritten in the M arch 12, 1996 A lestle by
Jim Stout, G raduate A ssistant/Student. I wanted
to correct Stout on his inform ation concerning
his University ID Card.
The cost for a University ID C ard is not
incorporated into the tuition and fees paid by
students. However, this is wonderful idea that the
U niversity should explore. T he U niversity
provides your ID Card to you free of charge, and
consequently it is the property of SIU E.
Upon receiving an ID Card, students, faculty
and staff sign an agreem ent that, am ong other
things, states th at they agree to pay the
replacem ent fee if that card is lost, stolen or
damaged. As I write this response to you, I am
overlooking your signed agreem ent.
I understan d your
fru stratio n in these
matters, but you should check your facts before
you draw conclusions.

letter to the editor.

Student tired of Housing and Police departments
I am writing this letter to complain about two
d ep artm en ts on this cam pus— the S IU E Police
D epartm ent and University Housing.
First of all, I will give you some background
inform ation as to why I am voicing these complaints.
I live at Tower Lake, and this past O ctober, we
discovered that a room m ate of mine had stolen
another room m ate’s Call Edge card and ran up over
$200 worth of phone calls on it. W hen we discovered
this had happened, my room m ate that stole the card
was confronted, became upset, packed a few things,
and said that she would pay back the money to my
room m ate. She also said that she would be back the
next day for the rem ainder of her things. That was the
last time that we saw her.
We spoke with som eone from Housing and were
told that once she stopped paying for the apartm ent
and did not come for her things, they would make
sure that her things would be moved out. Several
times in the past few m onths we have spoken with
housing about this; however, we are still walking
around her things. Housing even sent a letter to the
apartm ent to inform us that they would be coming to
get her things, and we have been verbally prom ised
this on several occasions. Unfortunately, we have
never seen a m em ber of the H ousing staff come to
our apartm ent for this reason. We are tired of getting
the run-around by the Housing Office, and would
like for them to finally live up to their promises.
A s far as the campus police’s role in this situation,
the night that this was discovered, my room m ate who
had her card stolen called the police to press charges.
Initially, an officer came and m ade a report of the
incident. A few days later, another officer came to the
apartm ent and got a w ritten statem ent from both my
room m ate and myself. This was the last time that we
heard anything from the police departm ent.

Several weeks ago, my room m ate received a letter
from Call Edge telling her that the bill must be paid
or she would not receive her grades. Since she did not
m ake the calls, she called the police and was told that
they were “continuing the investigation.”
W hat exactly does th at m ean? The police
departm ent has the p erp etrato r’s perm anent address
and phone num ber ... surely in the past five m onths
they could have contacted her to see what she was
planning to do regarding the incident. To the best of
our knowledge that has not taken place, because we
have not heard of this happening.
To us, it does not seem as if the police are very
interested in getting my room m ate’s m oney back to
h er and closing this case. I know that the police
departm ent has been busy in the past few m onths
with the phone fraud incident, and that a million
dollar debt is far greater than a $200 one, but to a
struggling college student, $200 can in fact seem like
a million dollars. To me, it seems as if SIU E is more
interested in getting money for them selves than
protecting the welfare of its students and that doesn’t
seem quite fair. This m akes me wonder: how many
oth er cases regarding students rem ain untouched?
To U niversity H ousing and the S IU E Police
D epartm ent: my room m ates and I have suffered long
enough because of this m atter. It would be nice if our
ex-room m ate’s things could be m oved out, and that
my room m ate could som ehow get her m oney back.
We feel as if we have been lied to by both of these
departm ents over and over again. We are tired of not
being listened to, and we feel as if we are being
punished because of the actions of som eone else.

Sr., Business Management

letter to the editor--------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abdul-Rauf didn’t stand long for his belief
In the M arch 14 edition of The Alestle, E ditor Roy Gilm ore blasted the NBA’s suspension of D enver Nuggets
point guard M ahm oud Abdul-Rauf. Abdul-Rauf, formerly known as Chris Jackson, d efied the NBA by failing
to obey one of the rules which states that players, coaches and trainers m ust “stand and line up in a dignified
posture” during the US and Canadian national anthem .
G ilm ore’s article defending the actions of A bdul-R auf was, at best, weak. Com paring A b d u l-R au fs actions
to those of drunken fans was logically inept. A bdul-R auf en tered into a contract; an “agreem ent, esp. a written
one enforceable by law, between two or m ore people,” as defined by W ebster. The contract basically is a simple
one. By following the rules and m aintaining his level of play, A bdul-R auf would receive an am ount of money
that most Am ericans will not see during their lifetime. The drunken fans were not being paid to “stand and line
up in a dignified posture.” A bdul-R auf was.
Gilm ore attem pted to m ake the issue patriotism. The reason A bdul-R auf was fined was because he didn’t
follow his contract, not that he w asn’t showing the proper am ount of patriotism . I have no objection to AbdulR a u fs desire to express his opinion that the A m erican flag is a “symbol of oppression, of tyranny.” However, if
he decides to break his contract, he should not expect a paycheck.
The A m erican dream is what Chris Jackson sought. H e was rew arded for his hard work with the opportunity
to play in the NBA, and the money to m ake life easier for his family and himself. It is this dream that AbdulR auf is claiming that oppresses him.
On M arch 14, A bdul-R auf announced that he would stand for the national anthem . W hen I heard the
announcem ent I thought I must have missed something. O ne day, A bdul-R auf claims that his religion will not
allow him to stand. A fter a few days of not being paid, A bdul-R auf states that, although he is not conceding, he
will stand. Maybe now he will close his eyes in protest, o r possibly even hum aloud while placing his fingers in
his ears.

are several reasons why,” Signorello responded. “O ne reason is the lack of announcem ents
given to the paper about the scheduled events, and another reason is that there aren’t enough
student reporters to cover these events.”
Signorello added, “There aren’t enough students on campus who are willing to give the
time and effort the m embers of our staff do to cover the events. Also, it is the Editor-inC hief’s job to prioritize what is newsworthy or not.”
“If Randy knows of any students who want to work for the paper on a volunteer basis, they
are welcome to come write, and w e’ll provide the training needed,” Signorello said. .

Debate__________________________________________________________________

To clear up confusion on his position on the newspaper, Signorello gave a description of his
advisor role.
“My duty is to advise the Editor-in-Chief and in this advisem ent role, to assist the Editorin-Chief to train the newspaper staff,” Signorello said. “It is true that I do not have editorial
control. I do have a responsibility to advise the Editor-in-Chief on what is liable and obscene
and other related issues, which I do on a regular basis.”
Signorello further explained his position by saying that he has the responsibility to deal
with issues that arise and he take this responsibility very seriously.
Signorello also added that when there are mistakes on the pages of the paper, they are not
due to poor advisement on his part, but because of the individual who is responsible for
committing the errors.
Signorello continued on by saying that the boundaries of his position are not only dictated
by the university’s policies and procedures, but also by what the Editor-in-Chief designates
and allows above and beyond his defined responsibility.
“I have worked with some editors-in-chief who would not allow suggestions on writing, or
even to look at the pages before they went to print,” Signorello said.
Signorello dispelled H obson’s theory on the use of student fees since m embers of the
Alestle staff, including himself, are not paid through student fees but through advertising
generated through the paper.
Hobson cited that a campus newspaper, in his opinion, is designed as a balance between
outside news sources and a prom otional media for events, with related stories on these events.
Hobson also said that the Alestle has had several, if not many, articles in the recent past
that have been inaccurate, not stating actual events, and feels part of the problem with the
paper stems from the fact that most of the reporting is done after the event.
“It is correct that a lot of events on campus don’t have reporters covering them, and there

m ethods they advocated for education’s im provem ent.
Owens took the firm est stance against nationally d istributed school loan program s by
saying that there is absolutely nothing in the constitution of the U nited States that says the
federal governm ent should be involved with education to begin with.
“ I think, if at all possible, colleges and universities should seek out private sources for
funding,” Owens explained.
However, the rest of the field supported some sort o f national education funding.
“ If it w asn’t for the F ederal S tudent Loan Program , I w ould have never been able to
receive the education that I have,” O blinger added.
The candidates were again divided over the question of supp ort for U. S. troops in Bosnia.
The only candidate to support the Bosnian m ission 100 percent was Baikauskas.
“We have a strategic interest in assuring th at E u ro p e is secure,” he said. “T here was
genocide occurring and I think we have to recognize th at.”
However, A ngel said that he felt the reports of genocide had been exaggerated and that
we were allowed to fight our civil war and they should be allow ed to fight theirs.
All but two candidates said th at they would support Newt G ingrich’s budget proposal,
citing the need to curtail spending and control the federal deficit. Owens, however, felt that
G ingrich’s plan did not go far enough.
“I think it is irresponsible to try to balance the budget in seven years. I think it could be
done in two or th ree ,” Owens said.
B aikauskas also expressed his disagreem ent for the G ingrich budget plan but for different
reasons.
“T here w ere increases in the defense budget. T here w ere provisions for tax cuts which we
cannot afford right now,” he said.
The candidates were in agreem ent that congressional perks w ere creating a rise in cynicism
am ong A m erican voters but disagreed on how to attack the problem . With the exception of
Z erkle and Baikauskas, the candidates w ere willing to state that they w ould refuse to accept
any perks or pay raises while in W ashington.
Z erkle stopped short of refusing perks, b u t did say, “I think Congress should treat itself
like any other governm ent employees. It could restore the public’s faith in governm ent.”
B aikauskas pointed o u t th at w ithout paid support, congressional representatives would be
lim ited to the wealthy who could afford to serve w ithout public support.
The candidates were in agreem ent on the abortion issue w ith the exception o f Oblinger,
who felt that even though he was personally opposed to abortion, he do esn’t feel we can
legislate morality.
The one issue all candidates could agree on was finance reform for campaigns and the
problem s caused by negative campaigning. T he candidates felt th at cam paign finance reform
could level the playing field for all candidates. They also stressed that negative campaigning
rem oved the focus in many situations from the issues.
A fter brief closing statem ents by the candidates, Pohl again thanked both the candidates
and all in attendance before w rapping up the meeting.
H e said, “The w inner today is the sam e w inner that we had at the D em ocratic Primary, the
voters.”
A fter the m eeting, attendees w ere invited to stay to m eet the candidates or to find out
inform ation about the new College Republicans.

discussed was, “Is there a lack of responsible black
m en in the com m unity?”
“Sometimes sisters are looking in all the wrong
places for responsible black m en,” Dr. D allas
Browne said.

The discussion focused on w hat black women
need to look for in a man. Even though, as Dr. ChaJua pointed out, alm ost one in three young black
men are incarcerated, the panel agreed that if black
wom en focus on the right qualities, they can still find
a responsible black man.
“L et your heart and head w ork together. If you
know what you want, you’re going to find it,” said
Dr. Jackson.
The panel also discussed the question, “How does
the self-esteem o f the black wom en affect her
success in society?”

AWAY FROM HOME

Dr. Jackson em phasized the im portance of self-esteem by
saying, “Lack of self-esteem will not allow you to be successful.
It will not happen.”
The im portance of self-esteem outside of the workplace was
also em phasized by Dr. Clark when she said, “Only when you
respect yourself can you respect others.”
The final topic of the evening was, “W hat is the current
state of sisterhood within the community and what can be
done to strengthen it?”
The panel agreed that black women have traditionally been
viewed as a strength in the black community. The panel also
pointed out that com petition between black women could
hinder the com m unity as a whole.
“We as sisters need to em pow er each other,” said Dr.
Vanessa Browne. “D o n ’t com pete with each other. We all
bring different things to the table.”
In closing, Carson read a quote stating, “Show me how a
country treats its wom en and I’ll show you their progress as a
nation.” Carson went on to recite a poem she had composed,
em phasizing the need for self-reliance for black women.
The next function for D elta Sigma T heta will be a forum on

Women's Studies courses on the rise at SIUE
By Jennifer Casey
Assistant Lifestyle Editor and
Danette Watt
Lifestyle Reporter
In 1970, Richard Nixon was in the White
House. Four students were killed and nine were
injured at Kent State University in Ohio during a
protest of the involvement of United States troops
in Viet Nam. Kurt Vonnegut wrote the screenplay
for "Between Time and Timbuktu." The Kansas
City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings in
Superbowl IV. And the first women's studies
program was established at San Diego State
University. By 1990, there were 621 such
programs nationwide. N ot surprisingly, 99
percent of those programs are headed by women.
In 1975, SIUE began its own Women's Studies
program, largely through the efforts of Sheila
Ruth and Rosanda Richards-Ellsworth of the
Philosophy department. The minor began as an
outgrowth of a class Ruth had offered in 1973.
That class, "Issues in Feminism: An Introduction to
Women's Studies" was also the title of a book
Ruth, now a professor, had written about the same
time.
Historically, women's experiences have been under­
valued and their achievements have been overlooked.
"Black studies gave African-Americans a chance to
explore their heritage, but there wasn't much
opportunity for women," Barbara Schmidt, associate
professor of English language and literature, said.
Schmidt is the current coordinator of the Women's
Studies program.
"It gives women a sustained opportunity to look at

a subject matter from another perspective. It allows
women to examine issues in a comfortable
environment," she added.
In a lecture given the summer of 1994, Ruth noted
that "In the study of women, women are objects. In
Women's Studies, women are the subject."
Getting the program accepted was a real struggle,
Schmidt said, "but once if was, Sheila Ruth was fairly
quickly able to establish it."
The criticism back then was basically what it still is:

that serious research isn't done in women's studies;
nothing of substance is offered; and it's just a
"touchy, feely" program with a lot of malebashing.
Unfortunately, there is still a lot of the same
criticism.
"So we needed to ask ourselves, what is
legitimate and how can it be portrayed as
legitimate? Women who worked in the women's
studies program were looked upon as not really
working. These views were held by a good
number of women as well as men," Schmidt said.
The growth of SlUE's women's studies
program has been slow but steady, although it has
experienced its share of setbacks and changes.
In 1978, a Graduate Specialization in
Women's Studies, Master of Philosophy was begun
(It has since been dropped). That same year, the
first brochure advertising the program was
printed.
"A t times, we tried to get a specialization in
at the Master's level, but getting the cooperation
from the various disciplines involved has never
worked out. Once the College of Arts and Sciences
is really in place, there might be another
opportunity because the departments would be
housed in one building," Schmidt said.
Currently, there are three courses offered at the
master's level — "Women and Language," "Women in
Administration," and
'Theories and Methods of
Women's Studies."
In October 1979, M argaret Simon, now a
professor in the philosophy department, had a halfhour show on WSIE. "Concerning Women" ran for six

years, during which she led discussions and
interviewed people on a number of topics.
"M y first show was on rape prevention and
prosecution," Simon said. There was also one on
women in the ministry, women and money
management, lesbian rights.... I don't know how
many people actually listened to it. It was taped
earlier and ran during the evening commute."
Simon also was the first editor of "Hypatia,"
a journal of feminist philosophy that opened its
editorial office at SIUE in 1984. She held that
position for about five years, when the editorship
rotated to the University of Indiana and then on
to Florida.
At first, the women's studies program was
housed in the philosophy department. In 1988,
under the recommendation of a university ad
hoc Committee on Women's Studies, it was
moved to the School of Social Sciences (now the
College of Arts and Sciences). An office was
provided along with part-time secretarial and
student assistance.
The position of program coordinator rotates.
It began with Sheila Ruth and went on to include
faculty from the department of Earth Science and
Geography, English and A rt and Design.
Funding has always been a problem for the
program. Except for two fiscal years, FY 89 and
FY 90, when the program received $15,000
both years, it has operated without official
funding. W ith the extra funding those two years,
the program was able to increase the number of
lectures and workshops. This resulted in 15 new
courses and 17 new faculty members. The
number of minors enrolled in the program
jumped from 192 in FY 89 to 333 in FY 90. That
was the last funding the program received. A
new budget proposal is being worked on now.
A Friends of Women's Studies Fund was
initiated through the SIUE Foundation to keep
the momentum going.
In 1989, a New Program Request was
submitted to provide a state supported budget
for Women's Studies. The request was designed
to enhance planning and coordination of the

A l e s i l e

courses, disseminate information about the
program, promote academic excellence in all
the disciplines, advise students and sponsor
lectures and seminars.
It also included a request for funds to initiate
a Women's Center. This was to be a place where
women could exchange information, find a
support network and offer special programs and
information sim ilar to Women's Resource
Centers at Washington University and the
University of Missouri-St.Louis.
The initial request was returned with a
recommendation to separate the service
component from the academic component. A
new request was submitted in 1990 and was
rejected.
Today, the women's studies program offers 27
courses, including Women in Art: Middle Ages
to W orld W ar II, Social Philosophy of the
Women's Movement and the African-American
Woman in African-American Literature.

"Chancellor Belck was hired in on her

Lazerson wasn't supportive (and he wasn't), he
was hired in by the Board of Trustees to work on
other things. The Board hired her with diversity

"Perhaps with Chancellor Belck's and Dean
Hahs' support, it will be possible to make more
resources available to the program."

T here are two new All-Am ericans walking
the SIU E campus this week as Brian A nderson
and Jayson Querciagrossa both finished 8th in
their respective weight brackets in the 1996
N C A A -D ivision II N ational W restling
Cham pionships at the University of N orthern
Colorado.
The C ougars had four w restlers go to
C olorado, but Jim C zajkow ski and Jason
C arter ju st couldn’t m ake it out of their
bracket. C arter, how ever, did receive
recognition for his outstanding efforts in the
classroom , m aking him an A cadem ic AllAm erican. H e has posted an 3.57 GPA while
m ajoring in biology.
In the 126-pound bracket, A nderson lost his
first m atch to the No. 3 seed of the tournam ent,
B raum on C reighton, who eventually captured
5th place.
“H e could have won the m atch, but he
missed a chance to take the kid down, which
would of won him the m atch,” head coach
Larry K ristoff said about A nderson’s m atch
over the weekend.
A nderson then went on to the consolation
bracket where he got a bye the first round and
then defeated A dam Feldm an of South D akota
State 4-1.
The next wrestler A nderson faced was M arc
Schulze of M ankato State where he lost 4-1
and was sent to the seventh place m atch
against Carlos Sumulong of San Francisco
State. A nderson lost by a fall to give him eighth
place.

All year Q uerciagrossa has been up and
down in his wrestling, posting a 15-14 record.
But like all good wrestlers, he knows when to
shine.
“It was the desire to win,” Kristoff said. “H e
knew w hat he had to do.”
A fter losing the first round in the 142-pound
b racket to th e No. 5 seed, Q uerciagrossa
buckled down and won the next two matches
to give him a shot at seventh place.
In the final m atch of his career in an SIU E
uniform , the senior lost a close match against
Shippensburg’s M att M entzer 3-0 to give him
the eighth place trophy.
C arter of the 190-pound bracket probably
got the h ard est first round m atch-up of
anybody as he went up against the No. 1 seed
and eventual cham pion Chad Lam er of South
D ak o ta State.
Needless to say, C arter lost his first round,
but rebounded in his second match against
Tyler Trieglaff of M oorhead State. He then lost
the next m atch to seventh seed Doug Keldson
of Portland State.
“I am really pleased w ith the way he
wrestled. H e caught the No. 1 wrestler in the
first round, but then he came back and won his
next m atch and then came back after that and
lost his next one. B ut he wrestled a good
match.
“H e may have lost that last match, but I
d o n ’t get upset when a wrestler wrestles to the
best o f his potential. I do get upset when they
do n ’t wrestle up to their potential,” Kristoff
said.

come back to haunt them because Northw ood
ended with the same record as SIU E in Pool A
with 4 wins and 1 loss. But since Northw ood
d efeated
the
C ougars
head-to-head,
Northwood becam e the cham pions of the pool.
“ I believe we could have handled
Northwood if we would have played to our
potential,” said head coach Sandy Montgomery.
Quincy prevailed as the champions of the
to u rn am en t w ith an 11-5 victory over
Northwood.
“We played really well for the field that we
were up against,” said Montgomery.
SIU E now sits with a 10-5 overall record.

Every Wednesday

Czajkowski came into the tournam ent
with a No. 6 seed and some high expectations.
He took his first m atch, but then lost in the
second round to Roy Dillow of C olorado
Mines, who eventually won the tournam ent
in th e 167-pound bracket.
“I thought Jim would beat him , but he just
ran out of gas,” Kristoff said. “H e still had a
chance to place, but he once again ran out of
gas against a kid from W isconsin-Parkside
(Mylas M uckerheide).”
All and all, this was a good end for C ougar
wrestling which started off with a lot of
injuries and now ends w ith som e AllAmericans.
