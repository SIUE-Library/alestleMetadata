way to cut loose after J
surviving midterms, yet fl
often students find
themselves not enjoying
j
fun in the sun, but
experiencing break behind
bars by not realizing the
laws that vary from state
to state. This week, filled
often with alcohol and

pleasure, can lead to
Jk
consequences many
students don’t want to
face. Renee D. Holler ^

Look out for the police
during spring break while
security becomes extra tight
as the law anticipates partying
college students and underage
drinkers. With bans on open
alcohol containers and tough
drinking-driving laws, many SIU E
students during break could find
themselves in cuffs.

Police warn illegal activity could land spring breakers in jail
■ BY RENEE D. HOLLER
NEWS STRINGER
Wake up at noon, go to the beach, go out and party
until the wee hours of the morning.
Ahhhh, spring break time is here again.
Spring break is a time for many students at SIUE to
relax and head south to such places as the beaches of
Florida, the Gulf Shores of Alabama or South Padre
Island. The atmosphere is one of partying, soaking up sun
and more partying. Although, spring break is about
relaxing, many students fail to use common sense and
good judgment while away from campus, according to
SIUE police’s Sgt. Chuck Thompson.
“Students want to party. They are getting away from
their studies and they want to take risks they wouldn’t
ordinarily,” Thompson said.
Thompson noted that the most pressing problem is
abuse of alcohol and drugs while in an unfamiliar setting.
Another issue is that of students driving while intoxicated.
Not only is this practice extremely dangerous to the
intoxicated individual, it also carries with it a very stiff
fine that varies from state to state.
“Police in the state of Florida are really looking out
for drunk drivers this time o f year, as are other states,”
Thompson said.

According to Detective Clinton Ward, spokesperson
for the Fort Lauderdale, Florida police department, police
are also on the lookout for unopened or opened containers
of alcohol in vehicles of underage students and open
containers in vehicles of drivers who are of age.
Ward said that underage drinking is the biggest
problem in the city of Fort Lauderdale during spring
break. The city also has a ban on open containers of
alcohol in public (on streets, beaches, etc.) and the fine for
violation is $25. Other common city ordinance violations
in Fort Lauderdale during spring break include disorderly
conduct and disorderly intoxication. Disorderly
intoxication involves drinking to the point of excess and
creating a disturbance, while disorderly conduct involves
creating a disturbance whether or not one is under the
influence of alcohol. These violations also carry with
them a $25 fine.
Ward also stressed that females need to watch their
drinks. Many drugs, including rohypnol (known as
“roofies”), are colorless, odorless and tasteless and can be
slipped easily into a beverage that is unattended, even for
a moment. These drugs are responsible for thousands of
date rapes, as the victim is knocked unconscious and
cannot respond to or remember the assault.
“If at all possible, watch your drink as it is being
prepared and only accept drinks that are being served to
you directly from an employee of the bar or restaurant you

are patronizing,” Ward said.
Both law enforcement professionals emphasized the
use of common sense when going away for spring break.
Always stay in groups of two or more and don’t allow
yourself to be stranded from the people you came with.
Do not accept a ride or an invitation from a person you
just met, no matter how friendly or “normal” that person
may seem. Also, always carry on you the name and
telephone number of both the establishment you are
staying at locally and a person you can reach in case of
emergency back home. That way, in case something does
happen, you will have several contacts and will most
likely get out of jail more quickly.
According to Ward, many students are able to find a
comfortable medium that allows them to party and have a
good time while not getting into legal trouble.
“I have personally seen a decline from the hard-core
partying to a more relaxed atmosphere here in the Fort
Lauderdale area,”-Ward said.
A m anda Voso, a college junior, m aintains the
same sentiment.
“You can have fun, party and not get arrested,” Vaso
said. “Just don’t do anything stupid.”
“Realize that you are here to have fun, but don’t
abuse it. Just as much as you are excited to get to your
spring break destination and have a good time, you should
also want to make it home alive,” Ward said.

Tara’s double standard Even the young can 7 escape the shame o f innocence lost
W hen I was
younger, there was a
Danielle girl in my sixth
Belton grade class named
Tara. She was only
twelve like me, except the other
girls at school called her a slut
because she'd supposably “done
things” that someone like me (at
twelve)
couldn’t
possibly
understand. The other girls in the
class didn’t talk to me about
Tara. I had to overhear it because
I was a “nice girl,” therefore they
assumed I wouldn’t know what

they were talking about, them
being “mature”, and me, only a
“child.” And “nice girls” didn’t
know anything about those types
o f things. Nice girls like me just
sat and were quiet and listened.
Before we entered the sixth
together, something happened to
Tara. It occured on the new slide
set on the playground between
her and two other boys in my
class. And I remembered that the
problem w asthat she told.
I remember the day when it
happened
because
I

was there before it all happened.
I remember her and the three
boys sitting there and them all
with a strange look on their
faces. It was like the boys were
laughing at some inside joke I
didn’t know about, and the look
on Tara’s face was like she knew
she was doing something she
wasn't supposed to be doing, but
was there anyway. Needless to
say, I left because it made me feel
uncomfortable. I didn’t know
what they were doing, but I
knew that I didn’t want to be part
of it.

The following
week an
announcement was made that the
fifth grade boys and girls would
be separated on the playground
for the rest of the semester. The
teachers never mentioned why.
Word on the playground was that
Tara had told on the two boys,
saying that they were doing
something “nasty” and it was all
her fault. She was then a “slut”
and it was all her fault that we
were separated. There was never
any mention of the boys and I
knew them both. But no one was
really mad at them. No one

wanted to speak very kindly of
Tara. I remembered thinking that
it didn’t make much sense to me.
So by the sixth grade, only ill
was spoke of her. And it’s funny
to me now because the same
thing happens now, only we’re
supposed to be grown and have
better judgement. Yet women are
still “sluts” and “boys will be
boys.” But I often wonder that if
I had stayed that day and she had
left, who the slut would be?

Letters to the editor------------------------------------------------------------Some comments on Corey Stulce ’s Scooby Doo critical analysis and a response to an editorial on SIUE football.
Scooby Dooby D oo and
some logical analysis
My compliments to Corey
Stulce for tackling the issue of a
generation tragically deprived of
“consistently
good
cartoon
series.” His criticisms offered to
Scooby Doo were creditable.
While the gravelly voiced
Dane was certainly an important
contributor to the seventies and
early eighties; even Stulce gives
too much credit to the cartoon. It
is clear that Scooby consistently
provided us with lifestyle
considerations and effective use
of irony, Stulce is correct in
challenging its originality. I
prefer to think that as wonderful a
toon animal as Scooby might
have been, he was simply a more
m odern version of Sylvester.
That stamm ering feline who
along with Tweedy can only be
considered
that
animation
equivalent of the Shourd of
Turin. Though perhaps not
authentically original Sylvester
and Tweety did by their existence
pay great homage to the seminal
work of Roadrunner and Wiley
Coyote. Clearly, it was that
unflappable desert aviary and his
Kafkaesque predator the Coyote
that brought many of us a clearer
understanding of great literature

with their treatm ents o f plots
similar to C onrad’s “Heart of
D arkness” and K afka’s own,
“The Trial.” Salinger’s “Catcher
in the Rye,” was simply a modest
treatment of Schultz’s Charlie
Brown, and it was actually the
Roadrunner and not Holden that
motivated so many of us to go out
and experiment with life. But I
digress, for S tulce’s cartoon
commentary contains a major
flaw.
He fails to mention the
criminally underrated “M aster’s
of the U niverse.” Because of
anim ation
w ithout
facial
expression
and
significant
marketing tie-ins with action
figures, most critics prefer to
heap scorn on He-man, Skelotor,
Man-at-Arms and the rest. How
unfortunate that we fail to
acknowledge the important role
this cartoon played during the
Reagan
Presidency.
The
“M aster’s of the Universe” was
the ultimate morality play of the
decade of greed. It pitted the
besieged armies of He-Man and
Princess Teela, (who stood for
low interest rates, reduced
government
spending
and
unfettered international trade)
against the evil empire of “tax
and spend.” Skelotor and his IRS
loving m inions led by the
beautiful, but inflation causing,

College football is more
of a burden than a
blessing for SIUE
As a student who has never
attended a school (high school or
college) that fielded a football
team, I would like to comment on
Mr. Flowers’ case for adding a
team here. (“SIUE football could
ne a reality,” Alestle, March 10,
1998)
Mr. Flowers contends that
the profits from concessions from
one game would pay for a season.
While it seems logical that the
income from concessions for the
first game would be high due to a
curiosity factor, unless SIUE
builds - and fills - a stadium the
size of the TWA Dome, the sale
of nachos and cheese will
certainly not pay the bills.
Mr. Flow ers adds that
enrollment would increase due to

incom ing players. D ivision I
Nebraska may be able to score
touchdowns with fifth-string
tailbacks, but a small Division II
school just starting a program
would likely find itself in a
similar predicament as Principia,
a Division II school in Elsah, 111.,
that often struggles to compete
with a team of fewer than 30
players.
A team with such limited
resources would likely struggle
to win a game, much less become
competitive. It seems reasonable
to question how much student
support a Cougar football team
that lost its first 10, 20 or even 30

A
sign
seen
at
a

some years back reflected some
student’s wishes. It reflected its
makers’ wishes that their parents
would keep the money, and send
their kids a competitive football
team instead. If SIUE adds
football, students will likely be
asked to pay much more in fees.
W hether they get a competitive
(and much more importantly, a
financially viable) team is
dubious.

Budget writers put on the pork to close out deliberations
BOISE, Idaho (A P) —
Legislative budget writers rolled
out the pork barrel in completing
deliberations on the 1998-1999
state budget, pum ping $2.5
million more into public works
projects than Gov. Phil Batt
wanted.
The diversion of the extra cash
for projects in most com ers of the
state to solidify a m ajority
coalition had been planned for
over the past month as relatively
minor modifications were made
in the retiring governor’s final
$1.55
billion
general
tax
spending blueprint.
The bulk of the new money
came from savings squeezed out
o f other program s,
w hile
$450,000
is
expected
in
additional interest earnings on

state investments dedicated to
government construction.
But the Joint
FinanceA ppropriations
C om m ittee’s
additions
to
B att’s
recommendations only finance
future project planning. They
leave the governor’s heirapparent,
U.S.
Sen.
Dirk
Kempthome, to choose between
finding tens of millions of dollars
for the new construction or
reneging on building the projects
essentially
prom ised
by
M onday’s votes.
And if piling up millions of
dollars in future construction
liabilities for Kempthorne was
not enough, the committee also
voted on Monday to tap the first
$2.5 million of any midyear cash
surplus for parks projects. The

★★★★★

new budget that begins on July 1
already relies on the surplus
reaching $16 million, so the park
money would not be diverted
unless the actual surplus is even
higher.
Always conservative Senate
Finance Chairman Atwell Parry,
R-M elba, had to defend the
swelled public works budget
against renewed charges from
committee dissident, GOP Sen.
Stan Hawkins, that the panel was
spending the state into a tax
increase.
“I have a little more faith in
the future and the econom y,”
Parry told H aw kins.
“I ’m
com fortable with what w e’ve
done. I hope I don’t have to eat
my words.”
The committee adopted Batt’s

$21.3 million building budget. It
includes the state’s final $1.1
m illion contribution to the
University
of
Idaho’s
Agricultural
Biotechnology
Building, $3 million for the first
half of a physical science
building
at
Idaho
State
University, the state’s m odest
match for $1.7 million in federal
money for a parole violator
center and $550,000 to plan the
$10.4 million physical education
building at Lew is-Clark State
College. The state’s share of
construction is $7.4 million.
But on top o f that, the
committee added $150,000 to
plan a $9.5 million classroom
building at the U niversity of
Idaho, $150,000 for a $6.3
million fine arts center at the

Officials
await
details on
freezer
deaths
ALBERT LEA, Minn. (AP) —
Prosecutors were aw aiting a
coroner’s report and additional
details from police before
determining whether to file any
charges against the parents of two
children who suffocated inside an
old chest-style freezer.
A police report sent to the
Freeborn
County
attorney
M onday did not recom m end
filing charges, and Police Chief
Tom Menning said he opposes
charges.
“We have no reason to believe
it was anything other than a very
tragic accident,” he said. “The
message that needs to get out is:
If you are in possession of any of
these old freezers, either dispose
of it, remove the lid or door, or

Clinton highlighting family and children’s issues
BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP)
— President Clinton today called
on Congress to come to the aid of
poor parents facing a “crying,
unmet need” for quality child
care.
In a 15-minute tour of the
child care center at Housatonic
Community Technical College,
the president chatted and played
with about a dozen preschoolers
and watched as 4-year-old Alexis
Kennedy assembled a colorful
puzzle on a computer screen.
“Yaaay!” Clinton exclaimed
when she finished it.
Clinton wants to earm ark
$21.7 billion for tax credits to
help parents pay for day care and
tax incentives for businesses to
provide child care for their
employees.
“What I see here today is what
I believe every child in America
needs,” Clinton said. “There is a
crying, unmet need ... all over the
country for the kind o f high
quality child care that you offer
here.

“We do not need to wait
another year just because this is
an election year. We need to do
this now,” he said. "We cannot
have a country that asks people
to make a choice between
succeeding
at
home
and
succeeding at work. If we have to
choose, we lose.”
Clinton
ordered
improvements
in
federally
sponsored child care facilities,
such as ensuring that all centers
are fully accredited and that
proper background checks have
been conducted on employees.
Clinton also ordered that
federal workers be given full
information on which child care
benefits and options are available
to them.
His order covers 1,024 federal
centers, including 788 run by the
military, 109 by the General
Services Administration and 127
by other departments. They serve
about 215,000 children.
The president noted a new
report by the D epartm ent of

Health and Human Services
which shows that, due to
constrained resources, states have
set eligibility levels for child care
subsidies far below what is
allowed by federal law.
Today’s visit was part of a
series of events this week that
revolve around fam ily and
children’s issues.
On Monday, Clinton called on
Congress to act on tobacco
legislation this year, and d’e vote
some funding to an effort to
prevent teen-agers from smoking.
He will focus Wednesday on
w om en’s issues during an
observance
of International
W omen’s Day and will take up
the youth smoking issue again on
Thursday in a speech at the White
House before the National
A ssociation
of
Attorneys
General.
W hite House aides said
Clinton was drawn to the
Housatonic school because it
serves so many poor children and
those from single-parent homes.

Double rape has
WIU campus reeling

The Housatonic program has
47 preschoolers, ages 3 to 5,
about half of whom are the
children of faculty, staff or
students at the college.
The president also was to
address a fund-raising luncheon
by the D em ocratic Business
Council in W estport, Conn.,
before departing for Cincinnati to
speak at a private fund-raiser
hosted by Stanley Chesley, an
attorney who has represented
smokers in lawsuits against the
tobacco industry.
The two events were expected
to
raise
$850,000,
said
Democratic National Committee
spokeswoman Melissa Bonney.
Clinton’s attendance at the
Cincinnati
fundraiser
was
attacked by Public C itizen’s
Congress Watch, which said it is
a conflict o f interest because
Clinton must make decisions on
the issue of legal immunity as
part of the tobacco settlement.
“Mr. Chesley wants a tobacco
deal that grants legal immunity to

big tobacco because it will
resolve his cases and handsome
fees will be paid,” Congress
Watch director Frank Clemente
told The Washington Post. “This
fundraiser may not be a quid pro
quo but it is surely poorly timed.”
W hite House spokesm an
Barry Toiv denied that the
fundraiser is a conflict of interest,
saying Clinton is “not playing an
active role” in the legal fees
matter.
“This has nothing to do with
the legislation,” Toiv said. “It’s
not a problem.”
Chesley told the Post that the
fundraiser is not connected to his
work. He pointed out that he has
raised money for Clinton since
1991.
“This will be the sixth event
I’ve done for members of the first
and second fam ilies,” Chesley
said, referring to the president,
vice president and their wives.

MACOMB, 111. (AP) — As
police search for a double rapist,
students at W estern Illinois
University are studying sketches
of the suspect and sticking a bit
closer together after dark.
“It really scared m e,” said
Shannon Brennan, a senior
journalism major who lives in the
same dorm itory as the rape
victims.
“You think Macomb is such a
small town, and if it can happen
here, it can happen anywhere. It
made me realize that it’s no
longer safe to go with ju st one
person — you need to go with
larger groups.”
The rapist was still at large
Monday and a newspaper ran a
sketch that was distributed
around campus amid increased
security. Students are being

cautioned to stick together and
avoid isolated areas. Access to
the dormitory of the two victims
is being restricted.
The
two
victim s
were
confronted by a man with a knife
as they got out of a car in a
dormitory parking lot around 4
a.m. Saturday, said McDonough
County Sheriff Stan Carman.
The man forced the women
back in their car and made one
drive while he held a knife to the
other in the back seat, directing
them to a secluded field about
two miles north of the campus.
He locked one woman in the
trunk while he raped the other in
the back seat, according to the
university.
He then raped the second
woman, forced both of them in
the trunk and tried to drive out of

the field. But the car got stuck in
mud and the rapist fled on foot.
The women were able to push
their way out of the trunk into the
back seat, according to the
university.
They
were
treated
at
M cDonough D istrict Hospital
and released.
The assailant was described as
a white man between 18 and 24
years old, around 5-foot-7, with a
slight build.
McDonough County Sheriff
Stan Carman said he sees no link
between this attack and two cases
in November 1995 where WIU
students reported fighting off
white men trying to abduct them.
One o f those cases involved two
attackers, distinguishing it from
Saturday’s incident.

FREEZER-----------from p a g e 4
basement of their home in Albert
Lea, about 90 miles south of
Minneapolis, and closing the lid.
A doll was found inside the
freezer with the children, leading
police to believe the youngsters
were playing, Menning said.
Their
father,
M ichael
Baseman, 28, told police he fell
asleep for about an hour Sunday
while his wife, M ichelle, 29,
went shopping. After Baseman
noticed the children
were

missing, he found them in the
freezer, unconscious and not
breathing. He called 911, but
efforts to resuscitate the children
were unsuccessful.
State law says freezers that are
not in use and that fasten
automatically when closed must
not be accessible to children.
Violators can be charged with a
misdemeanor punishable by up to
90 days in jail.
The county attorney also will

consider whether there is any
evidence to justify filing felony
endangerment charges, said Erin
O ’Brien, an assistant county
attorney. Such a charge carries a
maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
“I ’m sure hoping we w on’t
have to take that step,” O ’Brien
said. “From the little I’ve heard,
it sounds like an accident.”

Australia urges Israel back to Middle East peace talks
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) —
Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Tuesday used a visit by
form er Israeli prime m inister
Shimon Peres to urge Israel to
resum e
peace
talks
with
Palestinian officials in a bid to
find a lasting peace in the Middle
East.
In a speech marking the 50th
anniversary of the formation of
Israel, How ard said a peace
settlement was more important
for both Israel and regional
stability than it was half a century
ago.
Peres, the most senior Israeli
politician to visit Australia, said

Israel had to heed the mistakes of
the defunct Soviet U nion in
recognizing that territory and
weapons were no longer so
im portant to nations as the
intellectual developm ent and
education of their people.
Peres said Israel had fought
five wars in its 50 years, winning
them all m ilitarily but not
politically.
“The greatest triumph we are
seeking is not the military victory
but the real peace between us and
our neighbors,” he said.
The Jewish nation had never
dom inated another people in
4,000 years, but that Jew ish

people had been dominated.
He referred to the demise of
the Soviet Union, a state “a
thousand tim es bigger than
Israel,” as being the result of the
Communists not understanding
the coming of the new age.
“No longer are states and
borders as important as they used
to be. The nature of the new age
means that the sources o f strength
and the sources of weapons, are
no longer territorial or material of
a nation.
“W hat makes the country
strong and prosperous is no
longer the size of the land, or the
nature of the resources or the

number of the people ... but the
nature of the intellectual capacity,
the development of science and
technology,
the
flow
of
information, the spirit of freedom
and the investment in education.”
Howard told a United Israel
Appeal fund-raising dinner that
the peace process should resume
urgently.
The Israel-Palestine peace
process stalled last year when
Israelis began building in Arabheld East Jerusalem and with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s refusal to carry out
promised troop withdrawals from
the occupied West Bank.

“I don’t pretend that the
obstacles to a settlem ent are
trivial or easily resolved,”
Howard said.
“The issues at stake are of
fundamental strategic, human
and
spiritual
im portance,
involving land and security and
the faith and way of life of
millions of people.
“There must be a return to the
negotiating table.
“The parties m ust talk —
directly, frankly and thoroughly
— about the full range of issues.”

East Texas pharmacist pleads guilty to wife’s murder
RUSK, Texas (AP) — An East
Texas pharmacist had claim ed
that his wife killed herself last
June by taking an overdose of
prescription drugs, then slitting
her wrists and shooting herself.
But
Frederic
W elborn
Lunsford admitted on M onday
that it was he who killed his wife,
Janis Pamela Lunsford.
After Lunsford’s guilty plea,
D istrict Judge John R obert
Adam son ordered him jailed
pending sentencing in about six
weeks.
D istrict
A ttorney
Jim
Cromwell said Lunsford killed

his wife to avoid losing his
children in a divorce and custody
battle.
A
seven-m onth
investigation
revealed
that
Lunsford carried out a plan to kill
his wife over a two-year period.
Lunsford repeatedly poisoned
his wife of 14 years with
prescription medication he stole
from Drug Emporium in Tyler,
where he worked, Cromwell said.
The m edication gave the
woman rashes, swelling in her
joints, slurred speech and other
medical problems, the prosecutor
said.
Lunsford told her she was

dying o f Lupus, a chronic
inflammatory disease, despite a
doctor’s report that she did not
have the disease, Cromwell said.
Officials said that on June 28,
1997, Lunsford gave his wife
excessive amounts of methadone,
a drug used to treat addictions to
narcotics
and
am bian,
a
hallucinogenic sleeping aid,
which put her in a coma like
sleep. Then he shot her in the
chest and cut her wrists as she lay
in the bed of their Rusk home.
The pharm acist told police
and family members that his wife
committed suicide because she

did not want to live with the
Lupus. But Mrs. Lunsford’s
relatives said she would not have
taken her own life.
The suicide claim quickly
unraveled.
An autopsy revealed the toxic
dose of drugs and investigators
concluded it would have been
impossible for Mrs. Lunsford to
take the drugs, slit her wrists and
shoot herself, investigator Randy
Hatch said.
Hatch said there were no
fingerprints or blood on the rifle
and bloody footprints led from
the bedroom to the bathroom and
a utility closet where towels were
found covered in blood.
Hatch said a N acogdoches
woman who allegedly had an
affair with the pharmacist helped
with the investigation. The
woman said Lunsford talked
about wanting his wife dead and
tried to hire someone to kill her.
Lunsford also told the woman
he did not want to divorce his
wife because he could not afford

to lose his twin 13-year-old
daughters. Lunsford lost custody
of two children from a previous
marriage and did not want pay
child support again, officials said.
“That is the only motive I can
find. I can’t find a motive
involving (insurance) money or
anything else,” Cromwell said.
“He did not want to lose the
kids.”
The girls are now in the
custody of Judith Raney, o f Rusk,
who m arried Lunsford two
months after M rs. L unsford’s
death. Lunsford’s parents and
Mrs. Lunsford’s relatives have
also said they will help raise the
children.
Cromwell said M onday he
will recommend that Lunsford
serve 35 years in prison and 20
years for his guilty plea last week
to a federal charge of distribution
of a controlled substance with
intent to commit a violent crime.
He would be able to serve the
sentences
concurrently
and
would be eligible for parole in 17
years.

Documents indicate agency knew of dangers of bus stop where teen died
BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) —
Newly filed court docum ents
indicate transportation officials
ignored drivers’ warnings about a
bus stop where a young mother
died in 1995.
A bus driver testified she and
others believed the stop near the
W alden
G alleria
M all
in
Cheektow aga, which had no
sidewalk or pedestrian^crossing,
was hazardous and had informed
their superiors.
Cynthia W iggins, 17, died
after being hit by a dump truck

Dec. 14, 1995. She had just been
let off at the stop and was
crossing a seven-lane highway to
get to her mall job when she was
struck. Her family has filed a
$150 million lawsuit claiming the
shopping m ail’s racist policies
contributed
to
the
young
woman’s death.
N iagara
Frontier
Transportation Authority officials
had said mall executives would
not let buses on mall property
that came from
B uffalo’s
predominantly black east side.

Wiggins was riding the No. 6
bus, which runs through the heart
of that area.
“Did you consider or do you
consider it a dangerous place ...
this bus stop, as a place to let
passengers out?” attorney Robert
Perk asked Donna Chrzanowski,
driver of the No. 6 bus, during a
formal interview last October.
“Yes I do,” she replied,
according to court documents
filed in the Wiggins lawsuit last
week and review ed by The
Buffalo News.

“If you had your choice, you
w ouldn’t have been leaving
people there, correct?” Perk
asked.
“No, I would not,” the driver
replied.
The documents were filed in
State Supreme Court to resolve a
procedural dispute
between
attorneys.
Ms.
Chrzanow ski
later
testified that drivers were
sometimes reluctant to report
problems because “nobody ever
does anything about them.”

The NFTA did obtain access
to the mall and other shopping
centers in response to community
protests that follow ed Ms.
W iggins’ death.
Besides the NFTA, the
Wiggins family is suing Pyramid
Co., the owner of the mall; the
state
D epartm ent
of
Transportation; the Town of
Cheektowaga; Majestic Pools &
Equipment Co., the owner of the
truck that struck Ms. Wiggins,
and John Bunch, the truck driver.

Closing arguments scheduled in Army sexual misconduct
FORT BELVOIR, Va. (AP) —
The case against Sgt. Maj. Gene
M cKinney is fundam entally a
case of abuse of power, a
prosecutor said in closing
arguments today. But the defense
said his accusers were liars and
cheats.
McKinney, 47, faces 19
charges ranging from adultery, a
crim e in the military, to
obstruction of justice.
“It’s not a case about race, it’s
not a case about gender, it’s net a
case about sex, although most of
the charges before you concern
sex,” said the prosecutor, Lt. Col.
Michael Child.
“This case is about abuse of
power,” Child said. “It’s about
the highest enlisted soldier in the
Army abusing the pow er and
responsibility that were given to
him.”

Z

E

T A

In his defense argument,
attorney Charles Gittins noted the
26 character w itnesses who
spoke on M cKinney’s behalf.
“Gene McKinney is America.
He made himself into a success.
He raised himself up from very
poor roots to become the sergeant
major of the Army. There is not a
hint, there is not a whisper, there
is not even a suggestion of any
impropriety in his first 27 years
in the Army,” Gittins said.
For jurors to believe the
charges, he argued, they must
believe that “suddenly, without
explanation, Gene M cKinney
became a serial sexual harasser.”
He said that would be “patent
absurdity” and called the six
women who accused McKinney
of pressuring them for sex, “liars,
cheats and admitted frauds.”
The defense argument was to

P

be followed by a prosecution
rebuttal, the last step before the
military jury of four officers and
four enlisted men gets the case,
probably
later
today
or
Wednesday.
The six accusers returned to
Fort Belvoir today and asked to
sit in the courtroom for closing
arguments, but the judge, Col.
Ferdinand Clervi, rejected the
request, calling it “a bad idea.”
In testimony last week,
McKinney denied wrongdoing.
He claims the women are lying
for revenge or other reasons and
also says he was the victim of
racial bias. He is black and his
accusers are white.
If convicted, he could be
sentenced to up to 55 1/2 years in
prison and be reduced in rank to
private.
In his argum ent, Child

I T Y

RHEMA C H R I S T I A N o u t r e a c h

compared
exam ples
from
McKinney’s testimony with the
women’s accounts and appealed
to jurors to look carefully at
“those simple
things
that
corroborate the truth, vs. the
implausible, which is what the
defense will talk about.”
In the case of Sgt. Christine
Roy — the only woman who
testified she had sex with
McKinney — Child noted that
phone records show more than 25
calls from M cKinney to her
house, saying M cKinney was
“obsessed” with her.
McKinney glared silently as
Child spoke and didn’t make eye
contact with the jury of eight
officers and enlisted men.
McKinney’s wife, who sat behind
him in the first row of spectators,
showed no em otion beyond
crossing her arms when the

subject of their marriage came up
or the night he allegedly had sex
with Ms. Roy.
The case against McKinney,
which started with sexual
m isconduct
accusations
13
months ago, has been a source of
great em barrassm ent for the
Army.
Last
summer,
an
independent panel concluded that
sexual
harassm ent
was
widespread in the Army and that
its leaders were to blame for
letting it persist.
The sergeant m ajor o f the
Army is responsible for advising
the Army chief of staff on matters
relating to 400,000 enlisted
personnel. McKinney, the first
black to hold the job, was
removed from the appointed post
after the wom en m ade their
accusations last summer.

■ BY TOM BANHOLZER
FOR THE ALESTLE
After a recent appearance in the
film “Kissing a Fool” with David
Schwimmer, the jump-blues band
Mighty Blue Kings are making a
name for themselves.
Within the last decade, there has
been a jump-blues revival in the
world of popular music. It has been
sometimes labeled as a swing
revival because the bands of today
have smaller assemblies and carry a
stronger down beat.
Jum p-blues was the bridge
between Big Band and Rock n ’ Roll
in the late 40s and early 50s. Band
leaders like Louis Jordan lead this
period in jazz history.
The revival in jump-blues can be
divided into two different styles.
One style has more of a swing and
rock feel heard by bands such as
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Royal
Crown Revue, and Cherry Poppin’
Daddies. While, the second style of
jump bands are staying true to a
blues style. Mighty Blue Kings and
Indigo Swing play this new brand
of jump.
Tonight at the Galaxy, Mighty
Blue Kings will be bringing this
new jum p to St.Louis again. They
will be traveling into town from
their home of Chicago, where they
are enjoying a very successful run.

They have been selling out
shows at The Green Mill, a Chicago
jazz club, every Tuesday night for
over two years. With two albums,
“Meet Me In the Uptown” and
“Come One, Come All”, all ready
under their belts for independent
label R-Jay, the Mighty Blue Kings
have recently signed a major label
deal with the Sony/Works Group.
Drummer
Jerry
De
Vivo
contributes this success to the word
of mouth they receive from their
shows.
“There are two ways to get
somewhere in this business: air
play or word o f mouth, and we are
receiving the better of the two.”
De Vivo said that the Kings want
people to come to their shows
because they want them to hear a
music that grooves.
“Some new jum p bands want
people to come to their shows
dressed a certain way or act a
certain way when they’re at the
show, but we don’t care what you
look like or how you act at the
shows,” De Vivo said. “If you y.ou
want to dance, dance. Or if you
want to sit on the floor and nod
your head, then have a seat.”
The Mighty Blue Kings have
had some problems with the new
jum p
scene
and
the jazz
community.

The story of the jazz man with the red vest on
■ BY STEPHEN WHITE
LIFESTYLE REPORTER
Leo Chears loves jazz. His love for the
music goes back to 1957. But his career as
a disc jockey, like the music he loves, is
timeless.
“I was in the army and stationed out in
W ashington
state,”
Chears
said,
remembering his first experience with the
music that would shape his destiny. “A
friend of mine had a huge, beautiful record
collection. At that time, my interests were
purely in rhythm and blues. But after
listening to his collection, all of a sudden
jazz became my music.”
Leo Chears, known to radio listeners
everywhere as “The Man in the Red Vest,”
has been “setting the m ood” for his
dedicated listeners since 1962. He js a
radio legend in the metropolitan area—
with a resume that includes experience at

over a dozen stations like KSD, WRTH,
WMRY and of course, WSIE.
“The red vest came into play when i
was at KSD in the early 70s,” Chears
explained. “As the story goes, Anheueser
Busch wanted to buy my show, and they
said they knew that they were buying Leo
Chears, but they wanted to call the show
something else. So when I was meeting
with them at the agency, I had a red vest
on. I said, ‘listen, how about calling me
The Man in the Red Vest because when
you go into a nice lounge the bartender
usually has a red vest on and a red vest is
in your colors,’ and so they bought it. And
they’ve bought me a ton of red vests over
the years.”
W hen Leo Chears came from WRTH to
W SIE over eight years ago, the station’s
late-night audience was almost non­
existent. Since then, his unique personality
has attracted a legion of dedicated

listeners. Several people call him just to
talk— on a typical night, he can get 20 or
more calls from such people.
“I don’t mind it,” he said. “It’s cool
because the same people who call you up
every night will protect you if anything
happens.”

Not everyone that listens to Chears’
show is a night owl. Some have to go to
work the next morning.
“I’ve gotten calls from people who say,
‘Leo, play something I don’t like so I can
get some sleep.

Following in the footsteps of
other costumed rockers like KISS
and GWAR, the Aquabats have
exploded onto the scene like a
real-life comic book.
The superhero musicians from
the
island
of
A quabania
performed catchy ditties from

their album “The Fury of the
Aquabats,” beat up baddies, and
cheered up a giant chicken at
Mississippi Nights a few weeks
back. Lead singer and fearless
leader, the Bat Commander took
a few minutes off from capturing
the world to give me a (belated)

interview.
What kind of fury do you
bring exactly?
All the fury that is the
Aquabats, the terror, the horror.
So what was the first show
you remember going to as a
kid?
It was actually Oingo Boingo
in the sixth grade. And afterward
Danny Elfman came out and
talked to a few fans. He talked to
me because obviously I was the
youngest kid there. ...He signed a
napkin for me and I was so
stoked. And now he’s gone on to
greater things, soundtracks and
such. I was a big Oingo Boingo
fan as a kid, Devo, the B-52s. O f
course, this was all back on the
island of Aquabania.
O f course. Can you give me a
little background about the
Aquabats?
W e’re from this island, you
know, that had been taken over
by this space monster. The island
was a peaceful place, and we
were enslaved by this space
force. We had to escape and find
help. We ended up here in the
Americas and got the help from
this professor. He told us the only
way to get back our island was to
conquer the world and counter
the space monster from his prime
directive. Because all super
villains want to take over the
world. So, he figured, if we took
it over first, then we could have
some bargaining power. He could
take over the world, and we could
have our island back.
How do you keep track of
each other while in costume?
It’s tough, but, by smell. The

e

older they are, the worse they
stink. Our bass player Crash
McClarson, who is kind of the
senior figure in the band, the
patriarch if you will, he smells
the worse. Then we go down
from there.
Where do you fit in?
I’m about right in the middle
of stink. And in the middle of a
lot of things, literally.
What would your particular
super power be?
I have the dragon breath. I can
breathe fire. I have the hypnotic
finger ray. When I wave my
finger in front of the crowd, they
seem to look at it a lot. They
expect something to happen next,
and then we’ll lay a song on
them. It’s crazy. And I’ve been
known to kung-fu grip a few
people here and there.
I saw your show in St. Louis
with Blink 182, and you
upstaged them. Do you ever
worry about doing that?
I don’t know if w e’re worried
about it. We’re trying to have as
much fun onstage and create as
much fun for the crowd as we
can. I think some shows kids get
the joke and some kids don’t. It’s
funny to see how hostile some
kids will get sometimes about a
band who’s acting silly.
You’ve had people get irate?
Yeah, punk rock kids, kids that
are hiding behind their own
shield of identity, seem to get
irate about things like that.
There’s always one or two kids
who can’t stand that somebody
up there acting stupid and getting
away with it. I think it’s great.

complained about the poetry,” he said,
smiling broadly. “It’s great for when we’re
in a lull or I need something to hype things
up. When I recorded those poems several
years ago I had a great producer that knew
just the right music for the poems. It kind
of just caught on.”
He said that he’s always been a night
owl. On average, he only gets about six
hours of sleep a day.
In 1958 Chears was just starting a
family, his wife was pregnant with their
second child, and he was working as a lab
technician at Barnes hospital. During a
game of street basketball, he tore the
ligaments in both of his knees— an injury
that would later lead to a debilitating case
of arthritis.
His knees have only gotten worse.
Chears has trouble walking and is in
constant pain, but he still comes to the
studios of W SIE every night ready to
work.
“Before I hurt my legs I used to walk all
over town,” he said. “I used to walk, walk,
walk. I had torn ligaments but I didn’t take
the knee operation— that’s basically why
I’ve got all this arthritis. I probably could
have gotten arthroscopic surgery now, but
not then. When I was young, the pain
would come and go. I didn’t think much of
it. In my early fifties, me and a friend were
joking around. He brought me a walking
stick, and said ‘Here, you’re going to need
this.’ I was walking kind of limpy, giving
in to the knee, but I was walking. Less than
a month later I needed the stick. Many
times I’ve felt like digging him up and
banging him in the head with that stick.
“I want to work here [at WSIE] as long
as my voice holds out,” he said. “I’m lucky
to have this kind of job. Jazz has treated
me very well. The thing I like about WSIE
is that nobody steps on anybody else’s
toes. We all have our own thing— you
know, Ross and Lavem e and myself. And
that’s really cool.”
Chears is proud of his identity as “The
Man in the Red Vest.” He wears his red
vests everywhere he goes. After all, it’s his
image. H e’s developed his own style as a
broadcaster, and he’s not afraid to speak
his mind.
“I always said that if they let me in the
door, I would kick it down,” he said,
smiling. “I’m not sure exactly what I
meant. I guess it means what I’m doing
now.”D

Cougar softball to try to get back on track in Florida
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Last weekend was one to forget
for the SIUE softball team. After
losing five of six in the Cougar
Classic, the Cougars will try to get
back on the winning track in
Florida this weekend.
“We played horribly, but I’m
not worried about it,” head coach
Sandy Montgomery said about her

team’s disappointing performance
last weekend. “We played against
ourselves. It comes down to
making the necessary adjustments
and playing more focused.”
SIUE makes a stop in
Columbus, Ga. to battle the
No. 13 ranked team in the
country, Columbus State, on
Friday before heading farther
south to Ocoee, Fla.
Once the Cougars hit the
Sunshine State, they will take on

nine teams in the week-long Rebel
Spring Games. Two of the teams
will take national rankings into the
games. Shippensburg University
of Pennsylvania is 14th ranked and
Merrimack College, in North
Andover, Mass., is ranked No. 16.
With less than ideal weather
conditions this week, the Cougars
have been forced to practice
indoors. Montgomery plans on
stopping at a junior college on the
way down to Florida and using

their facilities so that her
squad can get familiar with
playing outside again.
“I just want to get them on the
field,” Montgomery said.
Other teams competing in
Ocoee include University of South
Dakota, Southampton College of
Long Island University, Saint
Xavier
University,
Adelphi
University, Kutztown University
of Pennsylvania, Texas Woman’s
University and Long Island

University-C.W. Post.
“We need good pitching and we
can’t afford to make silly
mistakes,” Montgomery said.
SIUE is currently 3-6 on the
year and will open their
conference season on March 21 in
Evansville, Ind. The Cougars next
home stand will be the following
week when they take on
Indiana/Purdue-Ft.
Wayne,
Northern
Kentucky
and
Indianapolis.

Alesile Commentary

Jason Triplett breaks down the choice competition for the NCAA tournament
■ BY JASON
TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
We know who is likely to
come out on top of each bracket
in the NCAA D ivision I
tournament. But what about the
upsets? What about those teams
that are strong, but not strong
enough to get a No. 1 ranking;
the teams that may be the ones
that ruin someone’s office pool
this year.
We’ve heard over and over
again that Duke University is
great with the freshman class
following the shooting of Trajan
Langdon and the leadership of
Steve Wojciechowski. And, we
know that Antawn lam ison is a
superstar who will definitely put
the University of North Carolina
beyond contention for the crown.
It is evident that Kansas w on’t
need all their talent in the first
round to defeat Prairie View
A&M University, the only losing
club in the bracket. Also, the
University of A rizona’s talent
seems to be spreading with the
development
of
M ichael
Dickerson and lason Terry in
addition to Mike Bibby and
Miles Simon.
Each of the No. 1 seeds have
shown their weaknesses through
the course of the season. Duke
suffers from the youth that is
their bread and butter. Arizona
came into the season a little
bigheaded from their title run last
year dropping some “gim m e”
games early. North Carolina
seems
lost
when
w ithout
Jamison’s contributions this year.
And Kansas, when Paul Pierce
and Raef Lafrentz aren’t a factor,
can't rely on their guards as they
have trouble against zone
defenses that Lafrentz might not
be there to take apart for them.
So do we have to wait until the
third, fourth and fifth rounds of
the tourney to see good college
basketball? No way, it will all be
great competition and I have
picked a few higher ranked teams
from each bracket to watch for.

Illinois has a chance to come
alive in the Western bracket. Lon

excellent tournament coach that
he is. When he led Kansas State,
he took the Wildcats to within a
game of the final four until losing
to eventual champ, Kansas.
Senior guard Kevin Turner has
the ability and means to carry the
whole team. He mashed UCLA

Utah needs to
get a ju st little kick in all
departments to make waves in the
West. Their offense in the
tourney will need to center
around
6-foot-10
M ichael
Doleac. The only problem is that
Doleac has been sheepish about
taking charge in the post. When
Doleac starts pushing, shoving,
and producing down low, a
double team will surely follow.
Then, two things will happen:
opportunities for Hanno Mottola,
another front-court member, will
open up; and, if guard David
Jackson gets going offensively he
will shoot the lights out
in the west.

FLORIDA STATE
Florida
State
University’s tall and athletic line­
up shot them out of the blocks to
a 12-2 early season record. Two
of those early victories were
against C onnecticut and an
inflated Arizona squad. The
Seminóles were second in the
Atlantic Coast Conference in
rebounding next to UNC. FSU’s
front court has a certain lanky
quality in 6-foot-10 Randell
Jackson, 6-foot-9 Corey Louis
and 7-foot-1 Kareem Shabazz
that will make for a lot of tipdunks and towering rebounds in
the Midwest bracket. In addition,
FSU led the ACC in field goal
percentage at 40.4 percent. This
team is fun to watch but their
style brings on some shooting
problems that have plagued the
FSU perimeter game lately.

COMMENTARY from page 13

C L E M S O N
I can’t say
enough about Clemson
University. W hat this team lacks
in the offensive department they
make up for ten-fold in the areas
of
defense,
hustle
and
scrappiness.
A fter
almost
upsetting D uke in the ACC
tournam ent,
C lem son
finds
themselves taking the ACC game
to the M idwest bracket. Tony
Christie has to regain his
shooting touch from the threepoint line. He shot 50 percent
from three land in the first 18
games, let’s see if he can bring it
back for the last 6. Sophomore
Vince W hit is expected by coach

Rick Barnes to wake-up from his
inconsistent slum ber and play
like the 6-foot-6 madman who
scored 17 points in the Tiger win
over South Carolina. Clemson
will have the offensive to match
the D if a few players step up.
M I C H I G A N

W here’s
the
beef? It is in the South
bracket with the University of
M ichigan and Robert Traylor.
Michigan is the type of team that
needs to remember their focal
point. “Tractor” Traylor is the
main man and the offense will
thrive if he continues to murder
post defenders. Although streaky
and bold, the Wolverines downed

two major teanls this year and
proved they are real. They earned
a win over Duke off the bat this
season and thoroughly whoped
Indiana by Bobby K night’s
biggest loss
margin
ever.
Michigan tends to relax in easier
matchups. They beat Duke and
Indiana, then lost to Bradley and
Eastern M ichigan. Ironically,
Michigan has to respect their
opponents in order to be
successful. If they respect a team,
great, but then they might just
stomp them to show their respect.

^ KENTUCKY
The epitome of
unselfish play is the
University of Kentucky Wildcats.

That is, they have to be unselfish
as they have no true superstar.
Coach Tubby Smith has put
together an offense that works the
ball, shoots both inside and out
and
takes
advantage
of
opportunities. They have good
leadership in senior guard Jeff
Sheppard. H e’s been calling for
the ball, keeping his eyes open
for shots and hitting them after
Smith challenged him to lead his
team. The trio of Sheppard, Scott
Padgett and Cameron Mills will
make coaches loathe the zone
defense. These guys hit threes in
groves and all have a shooter’s
touch. The inside game falls on
Nazr M ohammed. Mohammed
has made himself into one of the

best centers in the SEC and will
need to be active in order to free
up Kentucky’s guards.

BRETT’S AND JASON’S
FINAL FOUR PICKS:
Brett chose the East’s No. 1
ranked North Carolina, No. 2
ranked Cincinnati from the West,
No. 1 Kansas from the Midwest
and No. 2 ranked Kentucky from
the South.
Jason chose No. 3 ranked

Two women sue Tyson after claiming Jazz’s Karl Malone says
he abused them physically, verbally
he’ll carry a handgun
after death threat

BALTIM ORE (A P) - Two
women suing M ike Tyson for
$22.5 m illion were traumatized
when he verbally and physically
abused them at a restaurant after
his sexual advance was rejected,
their lawyer said Tuesday.
Tyson’s lawyer, John Branca,
said a counter suit is being
considered.
“This is ju st another attempt
to wrongfully em barrass Mike
Tyson
through
m eritless
litigation against which he will
vigorously defend h im self,”
Branca said in a statem ent
released through his spokesman.
“He is currently considering a
counter claim .”
Tyson adviser Jeff Wald said
the suit was “absurd.”
“We think it was ,a total setup
for money,” he said. “This guy’s
like a target for every greedy
person out there.”
The wom en claim in their
law suit
that
the
form er
heavyweight cham p grabbed one
of them, cursed at the other one
and overturned a table before hot
coffee was throw n on him to
“ im pede his a tta c k ” at a

Washington bistro on M arch 1.
Tyson, w ho served three
years in prison for rape,
becam e even m ore enraged
when he found out one of the
women is a corrections officer,
the lawsuit says.
The women, Sherry Cole and
Chevelle Butts, appeared for a
news conference Tuesday in
Baltimore with their lawyer one
day after filin g the suit in
M ontgom ery C ounty C ircuit
Court. The women, both 30, did
not speak to reporters because
they w ere still “very much
traum atized,” law yer A. Dwight
Pettit said.
The w om en are seeking
dam ages for assault, battery,
defam ation
and
em otional
distress, and they also want
to restore th eir reputation,
Pettit said.
“These w om en were put
through a horrendous ordeal,
cursed, verbally abused in a
situation in front of a fully
packed restaurant,” he said.
Tyson becam e abusive while
he and the wom en were having
breakfast, the suit says.

Tyson grabbed Cole after his
sexual advances toward her were
spurned and “ said som ething
like: ‘Are you going to be my
next victim ?” ’ Pettit said.
The boxer is accused o f
overturning a table and cursing
Butts, who threw coffee on
him. He became even angrier
when he learned Butts is a
corrections officer, Pettit said.
Tyson also threw bread at a
customer who took a picture of
him, the law yer said.
The women were invited to
the breakfast by comic Michael
Colyar, whom they m et that
night at a W ashington bar, Pettit
said. Colyar was asked by his
bodyguard, who apparently was
acquainted with one of Tyson’s
bodyguards, if he wanted to have
breakfast with Tyson. The comic
then invited the women along.
Asked why the women didn’t
press charges, Pettit said: “They
were very much concerned that
they were not the cause of him
having any other crim inal
difficulties, regardless of what
happened to them .”

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) —
Karl Malone says he has no
intention of being an “uh-oh
kind of guy” when it comes to
protecting
him self
against
threats. H e’s got a permit for a
concealed weapon and “from
now on, I’ll be packing.”
Malone was the target of a
death threat last Friday at
Continental Airlines Arena in
New Jersey. The incident
spooked him and Malone has
decided he’ll bring a handgun
along on road trips from now on.
The Utah Jazz forward, this
week’s NBA player of the week,
has little faith in the security of
NBA venues.
“Not until somebody gets
shot of something like that —
and it’s going to happen, I’m
telling you — are they going to
do something about it,” Malone
said. “And I’m not going to be
one of those ‘uh-oh’ kind of
guys.”
Needless to say, M alone’s
decision
poses
numerous
security problems of its own.
Utah’s so-called “concealed

carry” law is relatively lax and
only one other state — Arkansas
— recognizes it. Concealed
weapons laws otherwise vary
and some states — New York
and California, particularly —
allow concealed weapons only
under the
m ost stringent
s u p e r v i s i o n ,
if at all.
Provided M alone secures the
necessary perm its, he would
probably
require
special
permission to carry a weapon
even on a chartered flight and
he would have to pack the
weapon
and
ammunition
separately. Firearm s must be
declared and securely stowed in
the baggage com partm ent of
commercial flights. Some flights
ban them entirely.
NBA
spokesm an
Chris
Brienza was reluctant to discuss
security. The league does limit
the number o f people permitted
to sit behind a team ’s bench
'an d the number of guards who
must accompany referees on and
off the court. He provided few
other details.

“We don’t want to be a part of
this swing fad. We don’t play
swing. We play jazz. Our music
swings, or for a better word
grooves, but it is not swing,” De
Vivo said.
“As for the jazz community, I
am a jazz musician and can play
jazz with anyone. Everyone in
this band has a jazz or blues
background. Jazz musicians just
get mad at us because we fill up
clubs. I would like to hear the
definition of jazz by the
individual that says w e’re not
jazz. No we are not pure jazz, but
we do play a form of jazz,”
he added.
Their latest release “Com e
One, Come All” is a mixture of

original tunes and covers of such
greats as Jimmy Liggins and
Percy Mayfield.
If you want to see what the
rave in Chicago is, or if you want
to see one of the new sounds of
the jum p-blues revival, the
Mighty Blue Kings is the band to
witness. Whether it is blues, jazz,
swing, jum p, or a band that
grooves you are looking for, the
Kings have it.
“We pour our hearts and our
souls into every show and I
think that is why people come
and return to our shows,” De
Vivo said.
The M ighty Blue Kings
perform at The Galaxy tonight
at 8 p.m.

It just so happens that we upstage
the other bands sometimes. A lot
of times we end up getting
clobbered by the crowd.
What exactly happens?
T here’s the raising o f the
index finger and shouting “You
guys are hom os.” O f course,
w e’re homosapiens; w e’re on
two legs.
What kind of defense shields
do the Aquabats put up?
We like everybody to know
that they can enter the circle of
love whenever they’re ready. We
create a circle of energy outside
the circle of love. We’ll pass gifts
down to them, like chicken parts,
whatever. We like to share.
How do you keep the band

well-balanced?
Showers, daily exercise. A
strict regim en. O ur band is
basically broken up into two
factions; those who are more
likely to fight crime and stop
evil, and those who are
determined to conquer the music
field. So, basically what I ’m
saying is, there are people
who can play their instruments
and there’s people that can ’t
really well.
But they try really hard.
Yeah, they try really hard. It’s
fun, because the songs we come
up with end up being middle of
the road. There’s hints of genius
in there, but you have to look
really hard.

W hat do you think your
first
celebrity
indulgence
will be?
It’s hard to say. (pause)
Giving back man.
Who exactly are you giving
back to?
The kids of course.
Always the kids. Now, do
you have an alter ego that
you're able to walk the
streets with?
Yeah, we all have alter egos;
the tennis player, the bookworm,
even the m illionaire. I’m the
millionaire, even though I have
no money. I like to dress the part,
the little mustache, the Errol
Flynn tights, the ascot, a pipe

tips are a reminder for students,
faculty, & staff.

692-B-FIT

1. Never drink and drive!
2. If you drink, avoid binge drinking &
never drink on an empty stomach.
3. Avoid jail or steep fines by adhering to ail laws relating to alcohol
use. Law enforcement is strict during Spring Break.
4. Ladies, be careful with your drinks. Don’t leave drinks unattended.
Only drink beverages served directly to you from employees of
the establishment. Date rape drugs are colorless, odorless,
tasteless, and may be slipped into your drink. Victim s can’t
respond to or remember the assault.
5. There is no substitute fo r sleep. Rolling your window down,
playing the radio, and drinking caffeine are only temporary
measures. Alternate drivers.
6. If you’re under age, don’t panic! There are alcohol-free drinks that
look and taste like the real thing.
