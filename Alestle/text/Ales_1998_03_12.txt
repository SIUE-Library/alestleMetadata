Students every year head«,
out for spreak break for
partying, pleasure and a
way to cut loose after J
surviving midterms, yet fl
often students find
themselves not enjoying
j
fun in the sun, but
experiencing break behind
bars by not realizing the
laws that vary from state
to state. This week, filled
often with alcohol and
*
pleasure, can lead to
Jk
consequences many
students don’t want to
face. Renee D. Holler ^
helps explain the do’s
and don’t for spring
break and how to keep
your spending money from
turning into bond money.

Look out for the police
during spring break while
security becomes extra tight
as the law anticipates partying
college students and underage
drinkers. With bans on open
alcohol containers and tough
drinking-driving laws, many SIU E
students during break could find
themselves in cuffs.

Police warn illegal activity could land spring breakers in jail
■ BY RENEE D. HOLLER
NEWS STRINGER
Wake up at noon, go to the beach, go out and party
until the wee hours of the morning.
Ahhhh, spring break time is here again.
Spring break is a time for many students at SIUE to
relax and head south to such places as the beaches of
Florida, the Gulf Shores of Alabama or South Padre
Island. The atmosphere is one of partying, soaking up sun
and more partying. Although, spring break is about
relaxing, many students fail to use common sense and
good judgment while away from campus, according to
SIUE police’s Sgt. Chuck Thompson.
“Students want to party. They are getting away from
their studies and they want to take risks they wouldn’t
ordinarily,” Thompson said.
Thompson noted that the most pressing problem is
abuse of alcohol and drugs while in an unfamiliar setting.
Another issue is that of students driving while intoxicated.
Not only is this practice extremely dangerous to the
intoxicated individual, it also carries with it a very stiff
fine that varies from state to state.
“Police in the state of Florida are really looking out
for drunk drivers this time o f year, as are other states,”
Thompson said.

According to Detective Clinton Ward, spokesperson
for the Fort Lauderdale, Florida police department, police
are also on the lookout for unopened or opened containers
of alcohol in vehicles of underage students and open
containers in vehicles of drivers who are of age.
Ward said that underage drinking is the biggest
problem in the city of Fort Lauderdale during spring
break. The city also has a ban on open containers of
alcohol in public (on streets, beaches, etc.) and the fine for
violation is $25. Other common city ordinance violations
in Fort Lauderdale during spring break include disorderly
conduct and disorderly intoxication. Disorderly
intoxication involves drinking to the point of excess and
creating a disturbance, while disorderly conduct involves
creating a disturbance whether or not one is under the
influence of alcohol. These violations also carry with
them a $25 fine.
Ward also stressed that females need to watch their
drinks. Many drugs, including rohypnol (known as
“roofies”), are colorless, odorless and tasteless and can be
slipped easily into a beverage that is unattended, even for
a moment. These drugs are responsible for thousands of
date rapes, as the victim is knocked unconscious and
cannot respond to or remember the assault.
“If at all possible, watch your drink as it is being
prepared and only accept drinks that are being served to
you directly from an employee of the bar or restaurant you

are patronizing,” Ward said.
Both law enforcement professionals emphasized the
use of common sense when going away for spring break.
Always stay in groups of two or more and don’t allow
yourself to be stranded from the people you came with.
Do not accept a ride or an invitation from a person you
just met, no matter how friendly or “normal” that person
may seem. Also, always carry on you the name and
telephone number of both the establishment you are
staying at locally and a person you can reach in case of
emergency back home. That way, in case something does
happen, you will have several contacts and will most
likely get out of jail more quickly.
According to Ward, many students are able to find a
comfortable medium that allows them to party and have a
good time while not getting into legal trouble.
“I have personally seen a decline from the hard-core
partying to a more relaxed atmosphere here in the Fort
Lauderdale area,”-Ward said.
A m anda Voso, a college junior, m aintains the
same sentiment.
“You can have fun, party and not get arrested,” Vaso
said. “Just don’t do anything stupid.”
“Realize that you are here to have fun, but don’t
abuse it. Just as much as you are excited to get to your
spring break destination and have a good time, you should
also want to make it home alive,” Ward said.

Tara’s double standard Even the young can 7 escape the shame o f innocence lost
W hen I was
younger, there was a
Danielle girl in my sixth
Belton grade class named
Tara. She was only
twelve like me, except the other
girls at school called her a slut
because she'd supposably “done
things” that someone like me (at
twelve)
couldn’t
possibly
understand. The other girls in the
class didn’t talk to me about
Tara. I had to overhear it because
I was a “nice girl,” therefore they
assumed I wouldn’t know what

they were talking about, them
being “mature”, and me, only a
“child.” And “nice girls” didn’t
know anything about those types
o f things. Nice girls like me just
sat and were quiet and listened.
Before we entered the sixth
together, something happened to
Tara. It occured on the new slide
set on the playground between
her and two other boys in my
class. And I remembered that the
problem w asthat she told.
I remember the day when it
happened
because
I

was there before it all happened.
I remember her and the three
boys sitting there and them all
with a strange look on their
faces. It was like the boys were
laughing at some inside joke I
didn’t know about, and the look
on Tara’s face was like she knew
she was doing something she
wasn't supposed to be doing, but
was there anyway. Needless to
say, I left because it made me feel
uncomfortable. I didn’t know
what they were doing, but I
knew that I didn’t want to be part
of it.

The following
week an
announcement was made that the
fifth grade boys and girls would
be separated on the playground
for the rest of the semester. The
teachers never mentioned why.
Word on the playground was that
Tara had told on the two boys,
saying that they were doing
something “nasty” and it was all
her fault. She was then a “slut”
and it was all her fault that we
were separated. There was never
any mention of the boys and I
knew them both. But no one was
really mad at them. No one

wanted to speak very kindly of
Tara. I remembered thinking that
it didn’t make much sense to me.
So by the sixth grade, only ill
was spoke of her. And it’s funny
to me now because the same
thing happens now, only we’re
supposed to be grown and have
better judgement. Yet women are
still “sluts” and “boys will be
boys.” But I often wonder that if
I had stayed that day and she had
left, who the slut would be?

Letters to the editor------------------------------------------------------------Some comments on Corey Stulce ’s Scooby Doo critical analysis and a response to an editorial on SIUE football.
Scooby Dooby D oo and
some logical analysis
My compliments to Corey
Stulce for tackling the issue of a
generation tragically deprived of
“consistently
good
cartoon
series.” His criticisms offered to
Scooby Doo were creditable.
While the gravelly voiced
Dane was certainly an important
contributor to the seventies and
early eighties; even Stulce gives
too much credit to the cartoon. It
is clear that Scooby consistently
provided us with lifestyle
considerations and effective use
of irony, Stulce is correct in
challenging its originality. I
prefer to think that as wonderful a
toon animal as Scooby might
have been, he was simply a more
m odern version of Sylvester.
That stamm ering feline who
along with Tweedy can only be
considered
that
animation
equivalent of the Shourd of
Turin. Though perhaps not
authentically original Sylvester
and Tweety did by their existence
pay great homage to the seminal
work of Roadrunner and Wiley
Coyote. Clearly, it was that
unflappable desert aviary and his
Kafkaesque predator the Coyote
that brought many of us a clearer
understanding of great literature

with their treatm ents o f plots
similar to C onrad’s “Heart of
D arkness” and K afka’s own,
“The Trial.” Salinger’s “Catcher
in the Rye,” was simply a modest
treatment of Schultz’s Charlie
Brown, and it was actually the
Roadrunner and not Holden that
motivated so many of us to go out
and experiment with life. But I
digress, for S tulce’s cartoon
commentary contains a major
flaw.
He fails to mention the
criminally underrated “M aster’s
of the U niverse.” Because of
anim ation
w ithout
facial
expression
and
significant
marketing tie-ins with action
figures, most critics prefer to
heap scorn on He-man, Skelotor,
Man-at-Arms and the rest. How
unfortunate that we fail to
acknowledge the important role
this cartoon played during the
Reagan
Presidency.
The
“M aster’s of the Universe” was
the ultimate morality play of the
decade of greed. It pitted the
besieged armies of He-Man and
Princess Teela, (who stood for
low interest rates, reduced
government
spending
and
unfettered international trade)
against the evil empire of “tax
and spend.” Skelotor and his IRS
loving m inions led by the
beautiful, but inflation causing,

Milton Friedman and the body of

planet and the free market system

For the most part, Stulce
should not be blamed for his
errors, he tried heard. Though he
failed in his commentary he need
only keep in mind the lessons of
the Gobots (another fine example
of the cartoon/toy tie-in) “Things
are often not what they seem.”
Perhaps if University’s required
m ore liberal arts courses in
philosophy, literature, math and
m ost im portantly economics,
Stulce and others would have
been better prepared to undertake
the critical thinking required to
fully understand the cartoons of
the early 1980s. And while we’re
on the subject o f preparation
what if our talented Lifestyle
editor had taken more biology
courses? W ho knows what
heights his understanding in the
perils
and
advantages
of
autoeroticism
could
reach?
Armed with that knowledge and
with his youth and vigor, perhaps
he could have helped some of us

old guys answer the question that
has replaced cartoons in our
frame of reference-Does it hurt
