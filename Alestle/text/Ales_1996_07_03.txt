New busing system makes debut
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
W h at b eg an as a survey
last fall h as c u lm in a te d
in to a new b u sin g system
th a t b eg an M onday.
Results of the survey
showed that some students
without transportation were
feeling isolated and were
unable to take care of personal
business because of the bus
system in use at that time.
That system, contracted
out to the IEA -N EA (Illinois
Educational AssociationNational Educational
Association) took students
between Tower Lake
Apartm ents and Hairpin
Drive in mid-campus.
The new bus system,
operated by Madison County
Transit, promises several
positive changes. Buses will
be wheelchair accessible for
disabled riders; there will be
an expansion of route hours
and students can get into
Edwardsville and beyond,
including M etro-Link stations.
Rides from Tower Lake to
the campus will remain free;
how ever, o ff-cam pus rid es
will cost stu d e n ts the
re g u la r fare: a q u a rte r in
m ost instances.
But the new system is not
without some controversy.
Some students protested
that something that would
affect students so much
should have had student input.
There have also been

complaints that buses will not go
to the upper level of the 500
buildings at Tower Lake.
Students will have to walk to the
Commons building in inclement
w eather or freezing
tem peratures to meet the bus.
Two dvil service and four
student drivers lost their jobs. One
civil service driver, Helen Holbert,
was rehired as a micro-film
technician at Supporting
Services.

driver, started Sunday as a

Monday, July 1, m arked
the first day of the new
busing systehi at Southern
Illinois University at
Edwardsville.
M adison C ounty Transit
(M CT) replaced the form er
busing service offered by
U niversity Housing. The new
system was a result of
negotiations betw een SIU E
officials and MCT. It
prom ises several
im provem ents including airconditioned buses.
Hoping to m ake the
transition easier for students,
the university mailed bus
schedules to Tower Lake
residents about a week ago.
Early M onday afternoon,
about half a dozen students
rode the bus from Tower
Lake to H airpin Drive.
Some students felt that the
new system has m ore flaws
than improvem ents.
“T he air-conditioned
buses and the fact that they
have m ore buses are positive
aspects, but I was told it

University holds annual high school leadership institute
By i.iCtte Watt
Assistant News Editor
N ineteen teens learned leadership skills
and discussed the First A m endm ent at the
seventh annual High School Sum m er
Leadership Institute.
You can do anything if you plan for it.
T h at’s one thing Candice Long, a senior
from Lincoln High School, learned.
Long said she signed up for the
Institute on the advice of a m em ber of the
A lpha K appa A lpha sorority. Long is a
“Senior P earl,” a high school student
affiliate of that sorority.
“I’ve learned how to set my goals for

the future and outline my plans. I want to
be a surgeon,” Long said.
The students lived on campus for four
days while they attended sessions on life
mapping, the Internet, the role of student
new spapers and more.
D an Kasten, advertising m anager for
the Alestle, spoke to the group about the
function of the paper and the press’s First
A m endm ent rights.
“We aren ’t censored by the university.
Basically, we can print anything, but we
understand we could be open to a libel

Court rejects affirmative
action
WASHINGTON—The Supreme
Court rejected a bid by the University of Texas to use race as a factor
in judging law school applicants, leaving a cloud of doubt over
similar affirmative action programs at state-run colleges nationwide.
Theodore Shaw of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund said Ruth Ginsburg’s opinion “makes clear that the court is not
endorsing the appeals court’s radical view and that affirmative action,
while still under siege, is alive.”
The law school scrapped the program after being sued by four
white applicants.

Bar entry age moved to 21 in Carbondale
CARBONDALE—The bar entry age in town went up to 21
starting Monday.
For the last year, people had to be only 20 to enter a bar,
although they were not allowed to drink.
The increase in the age requirement is the last step in a
series of changes proposed by city and Southern Illinois
University officials and students after an annual Halloween
street party got out of control.
“It was felt that an entry age under 21 basically condoned
underage drinking in the bars,” City Manager Jeff Doherty
said.
Only several years ago, anyone 18 or older could enter a
Carbondale bar.

Tower Lake D rive near Building
406. Buses drop students off on the
north side of H airpin Drive (Peck
Building) but passengers have been
instructed to board on the south
side of H airpin Drive (R endlem an
Building).
Several students said they were
afraid that by the time the bus got
to Building 411, it would be very
crowded.
“I feel it’s going to get very
crowded because the buses aren ’t
that large and the pickup spots are
lim ited,” M ary Hurry, Tower Lake

resident, said.
Two civil service workers and
four student workers lost their jobs
as a result of the new bus system.
The university did offer alternative
jobs to all workers but some at a lower
wage.
“It affects us m ore so than the
civil service w orkers,” JoA nn M arti,
a form er student bus driver, said. “It
is hard to find another job at the

said they get their news from television, leaving the paper for ads and comics.
Leslie D eckard, a senior at Kirkwood High and a m em ber of the yearbook
staff, said the leadership skills she learned at the Institute were ones she could
take back to school. She said her paper could be censored by her principal or by
the schoolboard.
“But my principal, Franklin McCallie, believes in freedom of speech. He
believes students should not be censored,” she said.
McCallie said he is a strong believer in First A m endm ent rights and does not
believe in “prior censorship.”
“O ur paper, The K irkw ood Call, is a forum for public opinion. It is student run
and student written. We have great kids who want to put out a great paper and I
only read what they ask me to. But I do tell they can’t libel or profane,” he said.
“Students should write what they want, within the law,” D eckard said.

Classes the day after... o m í
By Darryl Howlett, News Editor and Melanie
Adams, Editor in Chief
Having classes right after the fourth of July
never seems to be justified by the university.
Students are given one joyous day off only to
have to return to class the following day.
This year it is really difficult to understand
why classes are being held on Friday. Most
students, as well as faculty, probably want to go
out of town for the weekend. Certainly, maify
students take this time to journey to their
hometowns.
Not only that, but for many students who
hold jobs this sum m er this is the only time they
have to relax and enjoy themselves.
Besides, it seems to be com m on knowledge
that during five-week courses in the summer,
tests are scheduled every Friday. However,
since we will be off Thursday and the week is
shortened, instructors are faced with the issue
of w hether to test or not to test this Friday.
I am sure th at at least a few o f the
instructors are saying that they will just cancel

this w eek's test and m ake Friday a lecture day.
However, there are instructors who want to
give their students another grade opportunity
and are scheduling the end of the week test.
This puts a strain on them, as well as the
students.
As a result, the instructor has to push all of
T hursday’s m aterial for the test onto
Wednesday, and students are being forced to
spend their Independence Day studying for
Friday’s test.
B oth, students and faculty alike, would
benefit m ore from cancelling class. Teachers
w ouldn’t have to grade or prepare a lecture
and students would not have to drive half of an
hour or m ore to take a test or receive a lecture
that they are not ready for.
Basically, having classes the day after
Independence Day is ludicrous. M aybe the best
students and staff can hope for is to have an
alien invasion sim ilar to the movie
"Independence Day." If w e’re lucky they could
kidnap us and return us just before the start of
classes on Monday.

So long to open parking during break
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
The university took an o th er step in
eliminating “free” parking on campus. In a
m emo to the University Com munity from the
Vice Chancellor of A dm inistration Ken Neher,
it was stated that effective July 1 open parking
during breaks was term inated.
This cam e only after a year w hen the
university m ade lot 13 into a pay lot. Now the
university has a firm grip on yet another
parking space in which to charge students.
C urrently free parking is still allowed on the
visitor’s pay lot during weekends. However,
that too may become a thing of the past.
With the m oney generated from parking
fees, the university should have no problem s in
fixing such em barrassm ents as the roads and

streets inside Tower Lake Apartments.
How ever, w e’re sure the university will
come up with some excuse to create more
reasons for students to pay for previous free
items.
Several m onths ago, w hen increases in
student parking were first brought to the
attention of the student governm ent body, Vice
C hancellor of S tudent A ffairs N arbeth
Em m anuel, told the body that free parking still
exists in one area on campus. The area of which
he was talking about was the lot by the track
and soccer field stadium!
So students and staff if you want free
parking, to our knowledge, that lot is still open
for now. How ever, the way the university
works these days, don’t be surprised if a charge
will go into riding the M CT buses.

Sum m er Camps a go
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
The SIU E com m unity should take great
pride in know ing th at several hundred
students in the area are taking part in camps
being offered by the university this summer.
W hether it be a m ath and science, soccer,
basketball o r leadership camps, they all
provide young minds a chance to develop
skills. These cam ps are not only teaching
students leadership skills, but they also give
them opportunities to work in team s and try to
solve some of life's little problems. The camps
provide alternatives for young people before
the dangers of drugs, alcohol, and low self­
esteem try to take hold.
For several years the university has taken
upon itself the task of providing this outlet for
students to achieve excellence. Young students
from all over the St. Louis M etro area
participate.
Just this past week the university held a high
school leadership institute, giving high school

students the opportunities to have their minds
m olded. This can bring a positive effect not
only to the University Community, but to the
local community as well.
A nother aspect about the camps is that
when young students become familiar with a
university at a young age, chances are they will
want to go to that same college in the future.
A nother area in which the students can
learn at these camps is diversity. Students of all
different races and cultures can learn to work
together to erase the stereotypes that many
might have of others. The sooner these young
people can learn to interact with one another
the better!
A nd even though the younger generation
may cause longer lines in the cafeteria and
Union Station, the camps are worth it.
We hope the university continues to provide
leadership opportunities by offering different
camps to area youths. Not only are they our
future, but they are. S IlJJi’s future as well.

But W ard is not getting out without leaving quite
an im pression on alumni of the journalism program ,

early. And, most im portantly, no excuses.
“ I decided this summ er—short five-week
w orkshops—the last I’m ever going to be teaching,
that I’d play the other game: understanding, soft,
relenting. F irst thing that happened w as all the
coolers canie out; everybody sat there sipping and
slurping. People would come in and take off their
shoes and sit th ere barefooted. People would go to
sleep and, of cou rse, I wouldn’t w ake them up
because I’m now an understanding teacher. So
people would come in, put their heads down and
sleep. E verybody sat in b ack , so fa r that I had to
have my glasses changed so I could see them. H alf

teacher, he added. “ It ju st doesn’t work fo r m e.”
So what did w ork? Well, for some students his
demanding w ays worked quite well. Yet fo r others,
especially about seven students who filed grievances
against him, they didn’t work so well.
David Wagner, who gradu ated in December 1995
and is now an advertisin g sales rep resen tative for
P u litzer Technologies, said that he thought W ard’s
teaching technique w as very interesting because it
w as one that he had n ever seen before.
“ He simply dem anded a high level of perform ance
out of students b ecau se he knew he could get it if he
dem anded it, and he kept a stan d ard of ethics and
everything in the class a little high. He dem anded
deadlines. He dem anded good work and h e’d
throw it back at you if you didn’t give what he
knew that you could do. And I guess in a lot of
w ays...you could com pare his teaching style, I
guess, to that of a coach. B ecause a good coach is
alw ays on your butt to dig something m ore out of
you and often times you don’t quite understand
what the heck it is they’re trying to do, but you
look back on it in the long run and realize he

The A lestle, said that he didn’t agree with Ward's
method of teaching. In fact, K asten w as one of the
students who filed a grievance against W ard, but he
la te r dropped it because of p erson al reason s.
“ I did not agree with the w ay he taught because
fo r me, having been in the profession al work force
fo r a long time and coming back to w ork on my
gradu ate degree, his unorthodox methods of not
handing out a syllabus and handing pro jects back

you've been out in the profession al work force, you
get it right the first time. A s a resu lt, I didn't learn
much in his c lass except for w hat he demanded,"
K asten said. But, he added, "I will fo rever say that
he has a wealth o f knowledge fo r anyone who h as the
patience to learn from him."
W ard said that he knows he has been a source of
contention fo r m any stud en ts a s w ell as
adm inistrators and other faculty m em bers. But, he
said , he's read y to take what he gives.
“ I also don’t think the im pression should be given

Thom as O stresh, supervisor of Graphics
Design in the U.C. Print/Design Shop has
worked for SIU E as professional staff for 12
years and in that time has received many
awards for his perform ance.
His current award, first place for a
brochure he designed for the U.C., won at the
Illinois College U nion M id-M anagem ent
W orkshop (ICUM M W ). It is one of which he
is especially proud. The award was presented
to him during the workshop for “excellence
in graphic arts for the prom otion of campus
activities.”
“T he workshop and graphics com petition
at the workshop is designed for universities in
Region 9.” O stresh said, “Universities such as
Eastern, W estern, C arbondale and U of I get
together and show each other our designs,

basically to show each o ther what types of
graphics they are com peting against.”
O stresh said that S IU E entered several
pieces, from posters to brochures, and that
w hat he gained from the experience was
pride in his work.
“It m akes me feel good to see quality hired
by the university. It is good to know that
others, not always the people you work for,
but different people from o ther universities,
appreciate my work. It m akes me feel like I
am on the right track,” O stresh said.
O th er universities involved in the
w orkshop and com petition were: Eastern
Illinois University, Illinois State University,
N orthern Illinois University, N orthw estern
University, Southern Illinois University at
C arbondale, University of Illinois at Chicago,
University of Illinois at Cham paign and
W estern Illinois University.
