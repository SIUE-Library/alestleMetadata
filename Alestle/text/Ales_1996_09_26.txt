International Week!

Scott Anderson/The Alestle

Members of the Pakistan Student Association stand behind their display Tuesday as part of
"Exbihit Day" during International Week. International Night will be held Saturday from 6 10 p.m. in the Meridian Ballroom.

A frican-A m erican organizations on cam pus are uniting on
various projects, targeting m inority students.
E arleen Patterson, program director for Special Services
and D errick W right, cu sto m er service supervisor at the
University Book Store came up with the initial idea of bringing
the groups together.
“It’s a com m itm ent from G reek affiliates, academ ic and
social organizations to work together. This also includes all
interested students who are willing to help,” Patterson said.
Currently, the goal of the organizations is to have a m ajor
project each semester. This sem ester a voter registration drive
is being sponsored to get “last m inute” citizens registered to
vote before the O ctober 5 dead-line. A drive is tentatively
scheduled for O ctober 1 at various places on cam pus including
the University Center, Science Building, Peck and Building II.
The organizations hope also to increase the retention rate of
m inority students on cam pus and to help incoming freshm en to
deal with college life— both academ ic and social.
W right said that being focused on the projects is im portant.
“Just being together. To focus, setting on a particular goal.
We w ant to m ake these successful projects and continue to do
so in the future,” Wright said.
“F or the next project, we plan on discussing it as a team ,”
P atterson said.
O ne of the next projects proposed is an outreach program
for junior high and high school students.
“T hat project would help students understand that th ere’s a
serious aspect to college. It’s m ore than just stepping and
partying. We would like to bring students on cam pus and see us
(organizations) study,” Patterson said.

By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
A reco m m en d ation has been m ade and if
accepted by the SIU B oard of Trustees, Dr. Janet
M cReynolds will becom e associate vice chancellor
for student affairs at SIU E on O ctober 1.
The recom m endation is likely to be on the next
agenda, according to Sam Smith, director of news
services. H e also said the ratification is a routine
procedure and sees no reason the recom m endation
would be disapproved.
A n em ployee of the university since 1977,
M cReynolds has been assistant to the provost and
vice chancellor for academ ic affairs since 1984.
Earlier this year she becam e assistant provost.
David Werner, provost and vice chancellor for

Hospital shuts down poison-control center

International __________________ ____________

CHICAGO — A hospital in Rockford shut down its poisoncontrol hot line over the summer, citing lack of sufficient state
funds. Swedish-American Hospital served the entire state
outside the Chicago area. It costs about $200,000 to run the
service, little of which comes from state grants.
Subsequently, thousands of central and southern Illinois
residents began calling the Regional Poison-Control Center
at Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital in St. Louis. That
avenue may be blocked if the state of Illinois doesn’t start
paying Cardinal Glennon for that service.

Major powers sign ban on testing nuclear weapons

River Bend industries named top state polluters

UNITED NATIONS — The United States and other major nuclear
powers overrode the objections of India Tuesday and signed a treaty
to end all testing and development of nuclear weapons. President
Clinton called the pact “the longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in
arms control history.” Representatives from China, Britain, France
and Russia were among those who also signed the treaty.
India, which set off a nuclear explosion in 1974 and is believed to
have a clandestine nuclear weapons program that it doesn’t want to
give up, won’t sign because the treaty does not set a date for the total
elimination of nuclear weapons. Pakistan, also thought to have a
covert nuclear weapons program, has indicated it won’t sign the pact
if India doesn’t.

ALTON — A private research group released a study that
states that River Bend industries are among the worst
polluters in the state. According to the Washington-based
Environmental Working Group, Illinois ranks fourth in the
nation in the amount of toxic chemicals dumped into rivers
and other waterways.
In overall toxic chemical output, six of the state’s top eight
polluters are based in the River Bend area. Shell Oil Co.’s
Wood River Refining Complex, based in Roxana, is listed as
dumping 25,480 pounds of persistent metals into the
Mississippi between 1990 and 1994.

W ASHINGTON — The White House was criticized Tuesday for
gathering confidential information on hundreds of Bush and Reaganera presidential appointees. Republicans on the Government Reform
and Oversight Committee approved a report that said President
Clinton’s administration may have been preparing “a political ‘hit list’
or ‘enemies list’” in its request for FBI files.

Calling all students: 'stand up for your rights and give 'em hell'

Students need to take back their right to voice their opinions and get involved
In viewing the recent two-day exhibit in the
Goshen Lounge this week for International
Week, I realized som ething was missing. A
lack of m ore exhibits and tables gave the
University C enter and International W eek a
lack-luster appearance.
Not taking anything away from the student
organizations who did participate over the
last two days, I just feel that there w eren’t
enough of them . Those who participated,
including the Indian Student Association and
the P akistan S tudent A ssociation had
Darryl Howlett
w onderful exhibits. T he d ecrease in the
num ber of events seem to be a trend of recent
times in the University Center.
W hen I first arrived on cam pus two and a half years ago, I rem em ber the
University C enter as being a jum ping, loud, lively place with plenty of activity,
w hether there was a band o r a discussion panel on a variety of topics. The
University C enter was the center of SIU E.
A bout a year ago, I noticed the first change in the center. Any special week
or sponsored event that was held was being participated in by fewer people. The
num ber of bands started to decrease and the G oshen Lounge just didn’t have the
same effect.
In fact, one particular event in February had only three tables supporting the
event—one of which was prom otional inform ation for Six Flags.
The point to be m ade here is that there might be a possible conspiracy by the
university. Could the university adm inistration be pressuring the University
C enter to limit the num ber of activities in and around the University C enter to
encourage students to attend class m ore often? Like I said, it is a possibility.
Some students I have talked to on campus said that having events in the
University C enter o r even obtaining a table involves too much work, too much
paperw ork, too much hassle. Now, w hether that is true o r not, I’m not sure, but
the fact is that the num ber of events and participants in the University C enter
have decreased within the last year.
W hatever the cause, I hope students and the adm inistration can work
T O G E T H E R to solve the problem .

□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□a
W hen students look around cam pus all they see is Coca Cola. In the
University Center, at the Wild Turkey, in the Peck Building. Perhaps they see
m ore than the red label. For some students, w henever they see Coca-Cola they
see MCT, OIT, policy and procedures. But m ore than anything the soda
represents a lack of com m unication betw een the adm inistration and students.
Not to totally blam e SIU E adm inistrators for the stu d en t’s lack of trust in
them , I believe some have m ade valiant efforts to bridge this growing gap. Vice
C hancellor of Student Affairs, Dr. N arbeth Em m anuel, has taken his job to
another level. Some would call it “taking the bull by thè horns”. H e has spent
countless hours trying to understand the problem s and frustration of students.
A nd if it w eren’t for him, the university’s relationship with students would be far
worse.
However, with the exception of E m m anuel’s efforts, the adm inistration still
does not completely understand the stu d en t’s point-of-view. Students expect to
come to a university and to en ter an atm osphere w here their opinions and
thoughts are valued. W here they are not looked upon as a financial dollar sign,
but bright and intellectual individuals who are looking to change the world.
Right now, their world is SIU E.
I am quite aware that the m ajority of faculty and adm inistrative personnel do
adhere to the thoughts and opinions of students. B ut do students feel that their
opinions and thoughts count? No. D o they feel th at they have been treated
fairly? No. A re students the essence of the university? Yes.
T h at’s why it would be a glorious day on this campus if students decided to let
the adm inistration know, in one way or another, th at T H E Y A R E T H E
UNIVERSITY. Something like a campus-wide “Pepsi-D ay” would be great.
Unfortunately, there are stipulations and laws that prohibit the selling of Pepsi
products on campus. However, there is nothing that says people can’t buy Pepsi
and bring it on campus. Just flower the university with Pepsi products. Hey, if
students could work it out perfectly, we could contact a representative from
Pepsi to do a nation-wide commercial.
If any students would like to propose a specific day for “Pepsi-D ay”, write the
Alestle. In the m eantim e, students continue to voice your opinions and “give
‘em hell”.

Letter to the editor

The Alestle needs to avoid sexist reporting
O n Tuesday, Sept. 17 on page 2, your “Top
Stories” feature carried a notice about the
deaths of four women in E ast St. Louis, whose
bodies were found “dum ped at sites around
the city”. The article goes on to say that police
believe that “the crimes are not connected,”
and yet, this story D O E S group them , in spite
of the fact th at these “unconnected” crimes
w ere p e rp e tra te d on four sep a rate dates
betw een A ugust 9 and Sept. 13. Why w ere the
m urders of four women collected together and
then reported upon as a singular event? Would
the m urders of four m en com m itted over time
have been similarly grouped into a cautionary
article? A nd why the use of the graphic verb
“dum ped” to describe the disposition of four
hum an beings?
We read in the final paragraph that a
detective who is investigating these deaths
blames the victims: “East St Louis D etective
G erald Crenshaw said wom en are becoming
careless and putting them selves in harm s way.
Women shouldn’t accept rides from strangers
or becom e friendly w ith-strangers.” Lurking
here are ancient and tired stereotypes about
women.
Mr. Crenshaw assumes that these women
somehow contributed to their own deaths by
placing themselves in “harm s way”. They were
“careless”. As readers, our focus is subtly
shifted away from the fact of their m urders to
som e u n su p p o rted allegations ab o u t their

behavior and/or character. M oreover, most
perpetrators of violent crimes against women
are partners or acquaintances of the women
and the acts of violence tend to happen within
their own homes.
Would Mr. Crenshaw have m ade similar
com m ents about male victims of a m urderer or
m u rd erers? D oes a hypothesis about the
victim s’ behavior som ehow “justify,” or
“explain away” their deaths? It reminds us of
argum ents about the nature of wom en in a case
of rape. “She asked for it.”
A s educators at this University, we are very
concerned that com m ents like this slip by the
eyes of the w orkers of the Alestle. This
indicates that the level of awareness about sex
stereotyping and violence against wom en is not
very high. Perhaps som e of the professors of
the trained facilitators of the Sexual Assault
P revention Program (through C ounseling
Services) could offer their services to the
Alestle to heighten staff awareness of these
issues. By doing this, we could avoid future
such sexist stereotyping and presum ptuous
reporting from our campus newspaper.

F or three years, a new building for the School of
Engineering has topped the list for capital developm ent. For
two years, funding for the project has been halted because of a
gridlocked state legislation. Unless som ething changes, it will
soon be the third year that work hasn’t begun.
A pproval for funding by Gov. Jim E dgar and the legislature
isn’t the problem , Sam Smith, University News Services
director said.
“The capital developm ent board can’t move forward
because the funds haven’t been provided. It has to be done by
bond sale, and the legislature w on’t release bonding authority
to the capital developm ent board. It isn’t affecting just SIU E,
it’s across the state,” he said.
Smith said there has to be a two-thirds m ajority vote for
approval and the “legislature is deadlocked politically. The
Republicans hold the majority, but d o n ’t have two-thirds of
the vote. They would have to get some D em ocratic votes in to
help.”
D etailed plans and specifications are com plete, funded by a
FY-90 appropriation of $843,500. But because of inflation,
total cost of the building is now an estim ated $30 million.
Once built, the 97,000 square-foot building will be located
north of the A rt and Design Building, west of the University
Center.
H arlan Bengtson, dean of the School of Engineering, said
that the approxim ately 700 students in the school are scattered
throughout campus. Some are in the Science Lab Building,
others are in a building the university is renting from
University Park and most com puter science students are in
Building II.
“I can’t say that the students’ education is being affected,
but it would better enhance coordination of the program if we
w ere all in one building,” Bengtson said.
“It was intended to be a short-term solution and has
worked out well, but w e’re ready for a long-term solution
now,” he added.

Several students on campus are pleased to see the unity am ong African-A m erican groups.
“It’s well overdue. T he collaboration on different issues, events, etc. that effect the
community,” T errance Gaddy, a sophom ore m ajoring in elem entary education said. Gaddy is
also the president of the Black Student A ssociation on campus.
O ne student, D avid Douglass, believes the collaboration by groups will have a positive
im pact on the university.
“If people are truly sincere in their efforts—it can be positive. It has the potential to am ount
to great things for the A frican-A m erican population on cam pus,” Douglass said.
Wright is convinced that if goals like a high retention rate and developing leadership skills are
m et, the collaboration will be successful.
“If we can be successful here we can branch out to other areas, schools, students,” Wright
said.
Those included in the project are S IU E ’s N ational Pan-Hellenic Council, Black Muslim
Association, Black Student Association, N ational Association of Black Student Social Workers,
National A ssociation of Black Accountants, O rganization of M inority Business Students and
the National Association of Black Engineers.

S .E .A .C . teams up with
local organizations for
potluck, environm ent
By Kelly Victory
For the Alestle
The S tudent E nvironm ental A ction C oalition
(S E A C ) at S IU E has organized a com m unity
potluck for today at 6 p.m. in the Religious C enter
(geodesic dom e). O rganizers of three local groups—
th e W atershed N atu re C enter, the Tree H ouse
Wildlife R ehabilitatipn C enter and the M adison
C ounty C onservation A lliance—will speak about
how each of their groups began, involvem ent in the
groups, and specific ways in which people can help.
E ach o f these organizations are inspiring
exam ples of com m unity organization that im prove
the environm ent. SEA C is an active student group
on cam pus that would like to help create m ore of a
sense of com m unity on campus.
As one of the presidents of SEAC, I looked in our
area for a few people who have started som ething
extraordinary to help our environm ent.

A TA TA TA T
T he W atershed N atu re C en ter is located 10
m inutes from campus; it is an exciting island in a sea
of urban developm ent. W hat was once a sewage
lagoon is now a 60-acre nature preserve; hom e to a
variety of plants and animals.
Lisa M cLaren, educational coordinator for the
organization, said, “It is a special place to learn,
observe and listen. It’s a place you can use all of your
senses to experience yourself and nature.”
K ay K endall has w aited five years to see
W atershed get up and running. The K endalls
conceived the idea of a nature preserve and an
en v ironm ental education center, and later they
began work that is still in progress.
M cLaren has helped the center get off to an
exceptional start. But, she said that she would like to
see th e ce n te r o ffer m ore regular education
pro g ram s an d w orkshops fo r environm ental
educators. She added th at she would also like the
center be utilized m ore often by local schools and
scout troops as an outdoor classroom.
M cLaren encourages anyone interested to come
out and experience the center, either as a quiet place
to study and relax o r to simply get out and rem em ber
the little things th at are im portant in life.

She added
that she feels

proposals to get landfills off the floodplain and
fighting proposals to relax air quality standard
im posed on industry.
G eo rg e A rn o ld , fo rm er p resid en t of the
organization, founded M CCA about 10 years ago
when citizens decided to fight a proposed landfill site
in the local area. Since then, the group has expanded
to about 50 m em bers, with a w orking core of about a
dozen. M CCA usually m eets about once a m onth
unless a certain issue requires im m ediate attention
and action.
According to A rnold, “O u r prim ary goal is the
p ro tec tio n o f o u r air, w ater and land from

The alliance consistently tries to inform the public
about potential environm ental problem s in the area,
and also attends public m eetings and hearings.

L et m e begin by asking everyone one
question—why does it feel like we have been in
school for 12 weeks instead of six?
For w hatever reason, we are only in the sixth
week, so let me encourage everyone to stay
alert and focus. For those of you who are
freshm en, fight the urge to skip class, unless
you are close to dying. (G oing to the mall is not
an excuse!)
You may not believe it, but many instructors
rem em ber the faces of their students who
regularly attend class. You may not like your
instructors, and some of the m aterial may be
difficult to grasp, but ask yourself why you are here
and then decide w hether or not to go to class, as
opposed to hanging out with your friends who are
also skipping their class.
If you have not realized it by now, no one is
concerned w hether or not you attend class; it’s solely
your responsibility. I encourage you to m ake the
m ost out o f your college life by joining a professional
organization related to your m ajor and m ake college
work for you. M aking college work for you does not

Begin to surround yourself

Allow me to highlight a few
observations
of my own.
Campus Voice

who are not students may
not u nderstand why you
can’t “kick it” with them.
Second, you are not here to m odel the clothes you
buy at the mall. You w ouldn’t always be so broke and
in debt if you rem em bered the first observation; you
are a student. Third, how do you plan to
com m unicate in a professional m anner if you feel
som eone who speaks correctly is talking as if they
are from a different race? I say this because I was
told that I speak properly. Well, I just helped the
individual out by interpreting proper speech as

correct. Word of advice, never allow anyone to shake
who you really are. Finally, I believe the m ore energy
you spend deciding on a m ajor and less on trying to
“get with som ebody” the sooner you can graduate;
after all, isn't that the reason why you are here?
By now, if you are upset or w ondering who I think
I am, I’ll help you by telling you. I think that I am
somebody. No one asked me to come to college, so
why would they care if I succeed or not? A fter being
here for six years and experiencing campus life, I feel
obligated to try and prevent some of you from
becoming discouraged about the choice you have
m ade to attend college.
By all m eans enjoy your college life, but never
lose focus of the way your parents raised you. Yes,
you are away from hom e and free to come and go,
but that does not m ean you have to be irresponsible.
Part of being an adult is being responsible. Ask your
father or m other, did they achieve the things in their
life by being irresponsible?
E ndeavor to achieve excellence throughout your
college life, n o t ju st a that-w ill-do attitude.
R em em ber, accepting responsibility for yourself and
the decisions you m ake tend to allow you to keep a
level of control over the things th at happen to you.

11 goals in two games propel Cougars
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
A seven goal barrage by D arren Snyder led the
S IU E M en ’s Soccer team past B ellarm ine and
Kentucky W esleyan last weekend.
T he C ougars d efeated B ellarm ine 4-1 on
S atu rd ay in th eir first G re a t L akes Valley
C onference gam e of the season.
Jason M axfield started the scoring just over 10
m inutes into the contest from Snyder and David
King.
Bellarm ine countered 18 seconds later, tying the
gam e 1-1.
SIU E took over from there with three unan­
swered goals from Snyder. The W ichita, Kan. native
scored a m inute before halftim e to give the Cougars
the lead.
Snyder struck again with an unassisted goal at the

48:15 m ark. H e ended the scoring by netting a pass
from Todd H unter with under 11 m inutes to play.
“D arren is reaching his potential,” head coach Ed
H uneke said.
Sunday’s m atch-up with Kentucky Wesleyan was
the C ougar’s second conference test of the weekend.
Snyder continued his relentless offensive attack
with four m ore goals in a 7-0 SIU E blanking of
Kentucky Wesleyan.
Snyder found the back of the net off a penalty
kick at the 20:40 mark.
David King followed 23 m inutes later with a goal
from Todd H unter.
Snyder scored another goal 8 minutes into the
second half and M attias Persson added another
three m inutes later from Jason Turkington.
The last three goals came from Snyder at 69:42,
H unter at 75:08 and Snyder again at 77:40.
M ark Maxim had two assists and Tim Novak

played well on defense for SIUE.
The team is ranked 18th in the nation and Snyder
leads the GLVC in goals and points.
“This game dem onstrated how we want to play,”
H uneke said. “
A ndy K orbesm eyer and Chris Koenig team ed up
for the shutout.
The Cougars are 5-2 overall and 2-0 in the GLVC
with m ore conference play coming up this weekend.
“I am pleased that o u r record is what it is,”
H uneke said. “This is the m anner that soccer should
be played. G ood defense and exciting scoring is what
everyone wants to see.”
S IU E will play Quincy on the road on Saturday
and Southern Indiana at hom e on Sunday at 3p.m.
“This is going to be the one of the toughest week­
ends of the year,” H uneke.said “We are big rivals
with these team s (Quincy and Southern Indiana)
and this usually brings some intense match-ups.”

Volleyball H ead C oach Sandy
M ontgom ery said Gilm an has accom­
plished a lot for only being a sopho­
more.
“I think it is outstanding (being
picked athlete of the m onth), and
what she has done in only her second
year is outstanding as well,”
M ontgom ery said. “She’s leading the
nation in blocking and is playing very
well overall. She is a definite catalyst
for our team .”
Snyder was on fire this past w eek­
end, tallying seven goals in two
games. The Wichita, Kan., native is
first for the Cougars with 10 goals, 23
points and 31 shots. The junior also
leads the GLVC in goals and points.

potential.
“ In ad d i­
tion to being
pleased with
his statistical
p ro d u ctiv ity ,
I also
am
happy to see
D arren reaching his potential that
has been questioned,” H uneke said.
“D arren has developed his under­
standing of how to achieve.”
