Interest rate drop
causes increase in
financial aid money
■ BY ANTH ONY WATT

B ob F eh ringerM /eyf/e

Spring has sprung!
Five-year-old Chavon Borden takes tim e to sm ell the daffodils located in the
Quadrangle. Borden is the daughter o f Songela Dunagan who is a sophomore m o o rin g
in biology.

Financial aid is often the
deciding factor in whether or not
a person can attend college.
Financial aid can take the form of
loans, grants, scholarships or
work study program s. The
government, universities and
private lenders such as banks
all provide these services. On
July 1, 1998 the governm ent
will drop interest rates from
7.8 percent to 7 percent and
increase the amount of money
receivable
through
certain
financial aid programs.
“What you will see is that the
interest rate will drop nearly a
whole percentage point,” Marian
Smithson, director of SIU E’s
Financial Aid Office said.
This drop in interest will
save students hundreds of dollars
but many private lenders fear that

it will cut into their profit margin
to the point that they may stop
providing loans to students.
Smithson said that a school
like SIUE that provides direct
government loans would not be
as badly hurt by this as a school
like St. Louis University whose
students receive the majority of
their loans through banks. A
revision of the original plan has
already passed through the House
of Representatives and will go
before the senate this week. If
approved the new plan would fix
all interest rates for direct and
private loans and private lenders
would be given money by the
governm ent for continuing to
provide their services. The
revision however would not be
instated until sometime in 1999.

Congressm an John Shimkus
announced last week that some
much needed local road repairs
are included in a transportation
funding bill being reported out
of committee. Over $20 million
in transportation funding will be
brought into District 20, which
includes the Edwardsville area.
“The inclusion of funding
for improvements to Route 159
in Edwardsville and Route 67
and the Alton Bypass is far
overdue,” Shimkus said. “It has
been through the hard work of
many local individuals and
groups that this has been
accomplished.”
Funding of $4,275 million
has
been
allotted
for
improvements on Route 159 in
Edwardsville. Also allotted
transportation money is Route
67 between Godfrey
and
Jerseyville, which will receive
$6.8 million for engineering
work and land acquisition. This
allotm ent
will
also

construction of 10.6 miles of

Alleged
cougar is
a no show
■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
F.DTTOR IN CHIEF
The cougar was either shy
or was just passing through as
officials from the Illinois
Conservation department came
last Wednesday and found no
signs of a cougar on the SIUE
campus.
A G len C arbon couple
allegedly sighted the cougar on
March 14, while students were
away on Spring Break.
Police searched the woods,
but there was no sign of a
cougar.
“(There was) absolutely no
indication that there was a
cougar on campus,” said SIUE
campus police chief, Rich
Harrison.
The
alleged
cougar
sighting sparked interest in
many St. Louis television news
crews, who cam e to SIUE
cover the story earlier last
week.

‘Black Widow’: She mates, she kills
STARKE, Fla. (AP) — Judy
Buenoano filled her 13 years on
death row writing letters and
crocheting blankets and baby
clothes. As the clock ticked down
to her execution Monday and her
final appeals worked through the
courts, she waited in a cell a few
feet from the electric chair.
She seems a paradox: either a
doting m other or a ruthless
“black widow” who was drowned
her 19-year-old paraplegic son,
poisoned her husband with
arsenic and tried to kill her
fiance, first with pills, then a car
bomb.
Ms. Buenoano, 54, the oldest
woman on Florida’s death row, is
the first,woman scheduled to be
electrocuted in Florida and the
first woman set to be executed in
the state since 1848 when a freed
slave was hanged for killing her
master. Her death was to be
carried out on what would have
been her son’s 37th birthday.
Florida executed two killers
on successive days last week. Ms.
Buenoano’s execution was to be
followed by the electrocution
Tuesday of a man who killed a
convenience store clerk in Ocala
and was linked to four other
killings during a 1985 rampage
that reached into Texas, Arkansas
and Kansas.
Pensacola prosecutor Russell
Edgar, who gave Ms. Buenoano
the name that has dogged her to
this day, described her as a
scheming, cold-blooded killer.
“She’s like a black widow; she
feeds off her m ates and her
young,” Edgar said last week,
repeating com m ents he made
during her trial for the 1980
drowning.
She collected about $240,000
in insurance m oney from the
deaths of her husband, son and a
boyfriend in Colorado.
“It does appear the motive was
twisted greed,” Edgar said.
M ichael G oodyear was 19,
partially paralyzed and wearing
leg and arm braces when his
mother pushed him out of a canoe
in the East River near Pensacola.
Jurors voted for conviction and
recom m ended a life sentence
over the objections of Edgar, who

wanted the death penalty.
In television interviews over
the past week, Ms. Buenoano
said her son’s death was a terrible
accident, not murder.
“I suffered over it and I feel
responsible for his death ... It was
an accident,” she told NBC.
Edgar said she gave four
different versions o f how
Michael died: a snake fell into
their canoe and it overturned; the
canoe hit a log; he was
decapitated by a boat propeller;
he died from chemical warfare in
the Army.
“It wasn’t an accident. The
guy was paralyzed,” Edgar said.
“He had 15 pounds of braces on
his legs without a life jacket. He
was taken up the river in a canoe
and basically pitched out.”
Authorities also believe she
was responsible for more than
Michael’s drowning.
“She put that boy through a lot
before she killed him. She
poisoned him to make him
paraplegic. And then the guy ain’t
home from the hospital for 24
hours before she drowns him,”
said Pensacola detective Ted
Chamberlain, who plans to
witness the execution.
“A person this cruel really
needs to get what she deserves,”
he said.
Ms. Buenoano, a native of
Texas, was convicted and
condemned in 1985 for killing
her husband of nine years, Air
Force Sgt. James Goodyear. He
was 37 when he died of arsenic
poisoning in 1971, three months
after he returned to Orlando from
a year’s tour in Vietnam.
Sylvia
W.
Smith,
Ms.
Buenoano’s
law yer
in
Tallahassee,
is
challenging
evidence presented by an FBI
scientist at the 1984 drowning
trial. Roger M artz, who was
discredited
in
the
FBI’s
investigation of its lab, gave
testimony that was admitted as
evidence a year later at Ms.
Buenoano’s trial in Orlando for
killing her husband.
The Florida Supreme Court
ruled last week that there was
more than enough evidence to
convict her w ithout M artz’s

testimony.
Kim berly Hawkins, 30, a
waitress in Navarre, has stood by
her mother, steadfastly believing
in her innocence.
“She did things with us,” she
has told The Associated Press.
“She worked a lot ... but she
always made time for us.”
Ms. Buenoano, whose name is
Spanish for “good year,” also
was sentenced to 12 years on an
attempted m urder charge for
blowing up fiance John Gentry’s
car in downtown Pensacola in
1983. During that investigation,
Gentry told detectives about the
so-called vitamins she gave him
that made him sick.
“If they would allow me, I
would pull the switch myself,”
Gentry told Fox News Channel.
“There are people that are so evil
that they really don’t need to be
amongst civilized people. She
preyed upon people that loved
her.”
The inform ation about the
pills was key to uncovering the
other crimes.
She was suspected but never
charged in the death of Bobby
Joe M orris, a boyfriend in
Trinidad, Colo., who died of
arsenic poisoning in 1978.
Only two women have been
executed in the United States
since the U.S. Supreme Court
lifted the ban on capital
punishm ent in 1976. North
C arolina
executed
Velma
Barfield in 1984 for poisoning
her boyfriend and Texas executed
Karla Faye Tucker on Feb. 3 for
hacking a man and woman to
death. Barfield and Tucker died
by injection.
Gerald Stano, who confessed
to 41 murders in Florida, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, was put
to death last Monday for the 1973
murder of a 17-year-old girl from
Port Orange. Leo Jones was
executed 24 hours later for the
1981 murder of a Jacksonville
police officer.
Daniel Remeta, 40, who
walked into a convenience store
in Ocala to buy bubble gum, then
shot the clerk four times before
fleeing with $52 from the cash
register, was scheduled to die
Tuesday.

Enviroment group calls Illinois a net
exporter of toxins for fertilizer use
SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) —
Illinois companies sent nearly 14
million pounds o f industrial
waste to other states for use in
fertilizer from 1990 to 1995,
according to the Environm ent
Working Group.
Over the same period, Illinois
fertilizer companies received 6.7
m illion pounds o f waste, the
organization revealed Thursday.
A review o f federal records by
the organizaiton found 19 Illinois

companies exported industrial
waste.
Zinc
and
related
com pounds were the most
common, followed by sulfuric
acid.
Zinc also was the most
common waste product brought
into Illinois by eight fertilizer
companies and farms, the group
found.
The head of the Illinois Public
Interest Research Group called
for labels stating whether

fertilizer includes any potentially
dangerous chemicals.
Executive D irector Diane
Brown said current practices hide
wastes under the guise of
recycling.
“In this case, recycling is like
money-laundering; Send your
toxic waste to a fertilizer
company and it comes out
clean,” she said at a Springfield
news conference.

Illinois woman kidnapped while bird watching in colombia
CHILLICOTHE, 111. (AP) — Louise Augustine had
been robbed during one trip to Colombia and seen
guerillas on another.
But friends and family say the 63-year-old former nun
was determined to take another bird-watching trip to the
South American country, despite their warnings about
social unrest and their suggestion she let a foot infection
heal.
This week, some of their worst fears came true when
they learned she was am ong 30 people kidnapped
Monday by a rebel group at a roadblock south of Bogota.
“I was concerned about her travels to those South
American countries,” said Paul March, one of Augustine’s
neighbors in Chillicothe. “They’re in turmoil. Rebels
everywhere. But she has a mind of her own, and she left.”
Com m ander Romana, the local leader of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, confirmed
Thursday that four Americans and an Italian were among
the hostages. The foreigners are a prime kidnapping target
because they fetch the highest ransoms.

Her brother, Jerome Augustine of Peoria, learned his
sister was missing Wednesday when a fellow bird-watcher
from Peoria called him.
“All we know is that she’s over in Bogota or that area
and is being held as a prisoner,” he said of his sister.
He said his sister had spent 12 years as a nun in Terre
Haute, Ind., then continued to teach after leaving the
order.
“She used to put on a pair of jeans under her habit and
go out in the woods to bird watch and take her
habit off,” he said. “Some of the nuns didn’t
appreciate her.”
She retired in 1993 but has continued to
travel the world on bird-watching trips. She
was in Florida recently when she injured her
toe while jogging, and an infection set in.
“It was pretty bad when she left,” Jerome
Augustine said. “ We told her she should stay
home and let it heal, but she wanted to go. She
gets cabin fever pretty bad.”

In 1990, Scott Heimdal of Peoria was held captive for
61 days in E cuador’s jungle by armed Colom bian
guerrillas until Illinois residents raised his $60,000
ransom.
Augustine said he’s still waiting to hear from the U.S.
State Department but has talked to Heimdal.
“He said this thing could drag on for several m onths,”
Augustine said. “I hope they take pity on an old lady and
let her go.”

Doctor pleads innocent to fraud charges
SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — A
kidney doctor has pleaded
innocent to federal charges that
he defrauded the government and
health insurance companies of at
least $ 1.5 million
Dr. Mark Frazier entered the
pleas in U.S. District Court on
Friday.
Frazier and his form er
Spokane practice, N orthw est
N ephrology A ssociates,
are
accused o f m ail fraud, false
statements and false claims in a
14-count indictment returned last
month.
Frazier, 51, is accused of
running a scheme to defraud
Medicare, Medicaid and private
insurance companies of at least
$1.5 million over five years.
If convicted, Frazier could be
ordered to pay restitution plus as
much as $3.5 million in fines and
spend up to 70 years in prison.
The case arose from a whistle­
blow er law suit filed by Dr.
Stephen Fox, who worked with
Northwest Nephrology for about
15 months and now practices in
Colorado.

Frazier is accused in the
criminal case of asking other
doctors in the group to bill
insurers for a higher level of care
than patients needed for two
major types of dialysis. This type
of fraud is called “upcoding.”
The other doctors — Mary
Anne McDonald, Leo Obermiller
and Katherine Tuttle — do not
face criminal charges but are
named in the civil whistle-blower
lawsuit filed by Fox.
The lawsuit, which is pending,
was unsealed in January after the
U.S.
Justice
Departm ent
intervened on b.ehalf of the
Department of Health and
Human Services.
Lawyers
for
M cDonald,
Obermiller and Tuttle have said
those three physicians cooperated
with federal investigators.
O bermiller and M cDonald
now run Nephrology Consultants
in Spokane and Tuttle is research
director at The Heart Institute.
Northwest
Nephrology
Associates was disbanded a
couple years ago.
He lost his privileges at

Spokane-area hospitals, after
Spokane County prosecutors
charged him with threatening
another doctor and interfering at
Sacred Heart Medical Center, the
hospital
where
Northwest
Nephrology A ssociates was
based.
In December, Frazier pleaded
guilty to interfering with Sacred
Heart in exchange for dismissal
of a more serious harassment
charge.
Frazier was sentenced to 362
days in jail and fined $250. The
jail sentence was suspended.
Last July, he voluntarily
entered the C.F. M enninger
Memorial Hospital in Topeka,
Kan., for psychiatric treatment.
He eventually moved near his
family in Omaha, Neb.
Frazier said at Friday’s court
hearing that he will return to
Menninger in mid-April for two
more weeks of treatment.
He told Washington officials
earlier this month he does not
intend to practice medicine again
in the state.

Lincoln students reassured they’re
safe after boy brings gun to school
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) —
Lincoln parents, teachers and
adm inistrators were reassuring
students of their school safety
after a sixth-grade boy was
suspended for allegedly bringing
a gun to school.
Students told school officials
o f the incident Thursday, and
police were notified. Police
found a .380-caliber sem i­
automatic handgun at the 12year-old’s home.
Before sending her thirdand fifth-grade daughters to

school on Friday morning, Ann
Covalt told them to make sure
they told a teacher if they heard
anything about guns at school.
“It’s pretty scary,” said
Covalt, president of the Rousseau
Parent-Teacher-StudentOrganization. “But you can’t be
scared of everything.”
David Rutledge, Rousseau
principal, said he was personally
speaking to the school’s fourth-,
fifth- and sixth-graders to
reassure them of their safety.
Teachers also spoke
with

kindergarten through third-grade
students. And counseling was
available if students needed it.
“I’m letting them know that
bad things sometimes happen and
they are safe at school,” Rutledge
said. “My observation is they’re
doing pretty good with it.”
According to police, the boy
found the key to a locked gun
cabinet at home. He got the gun,
took it to school Wednesday, and
after school, he took it home and
put it back. Police didn’t know if
the handgun was loaded.

The Alestle is looking for news and lifestyle reporters.

Air traffic controller suspended after claims of on-duty drug use
MIAMI (AP) _ An air traffic controller at Miami
International Airport will be fired after he was found
unconscious near drug paraphernalia in a tower bathroom,
federal officials said Saturday.
The Federal Aviation Administration would not name
the controller, but said in a release that it is in the process
of firing the air traffic controller who admitted to on-duty
drug use.
WPLG-TV in Miami reported Friday night that the
controller was suspended after using heroin before he was
found lying on the floor. FAA spokeswoman Kathleen
Bergen said she could not give the name of the controller
or confirm details o f the case.
The FAA’s drug policy mandates term inating
employees who use, possess or purchase drugs on duty, or
who are under the influence of drugs while on duty.

Two managers have been transferred out of the tower
and to desk jobs elsewhere at the airport because of the
incident, the FAA said. The agency was investigating
possible improprieties in the way the drug testing
program as it is administered at the Miami Tower.
“Our employees are not warned in advance according
to our drug testing policy,” said Bergen, who referred to
the incident as extremely unusual.
Sherrod Shim, spokeswoman for the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association, which represents more
than 14,000 controllers nationally, had no comment on the
case.
“The FAA is the employer, and that is a personnel
issue, and we don’t get involved in personnel issues,” she
said Saturday. She had no idea of the frequency of drugrelated discipline among controllers.

Travelers at the Miami airport said they weren’t that
surprised to hear about the controller using drugs.
“Nothing is foolproof,” said Terence Hood, who had
just arrived from Tampa on a business trip. “ Those things
go on in all fields of work.”
“I just hope to go up safely and come down safely.”
Bob Esposito, a winter resident of Deerfield Beach,
who was picking up a relative flying in from the Bahamas,
said: “Nothing surprise me, I’m from New York. You can
expect anything nowadays.
Maxine Cummings of Largo, who was on her way on a
cruise, said, "It doesn’t surprise me that it happened and it
doesn’t surprise me that someone covered up for him.”
Her husband Bill Cummings said: “It’s the plane that’s
supposed to fly, not the controller.”

Inspectors go near Saddam’s hometown for palace searches
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U N.
arms experts inspected another of
President Saddam H ussein’s
palace com pounds Sunday as
they continued to search for
information on Iraq’s weapons of
mass destruction.
The experts, accompanied by
20 senior diplomats, visited the
palace complex in Mosul, 400
kilometers (245 miles) north of
B aghdad, N ils C arlstrom , the
head of the U.N. inspection team
in Baghdad, told The Associated
Press.
The inspection lasted well into
the evening, he said. He did not
give details or say where the team
will go on Monday.

On Saturday, the inspectors
visited the palace complex in
Tikrit, Saddam ’s hometown, and
saw a lot of construction work,
said A ntonio
M onteiro,
a
Portuguese diplom at working
with the inspectors.
■The official Iraqi News Agency
reported that Saddam visited
Tikrit on Saturday and was
greeted
w ith
a
rapturous
welcome by throngs of citizens.
Saddam climbed the roof of a
government building to greet the
crowd, who chanted "lo n g live
beloved leader.”
Tikrit is 230 kilometers (140
miles) south of Mosul.
The Tikrit inspection lasted all

Australian teacher seized in
Thailand by Myanmar guerrillas
CANBERRA, Australia (AP)
— An A ustralian aid worker
captured by a M yanmar guerrilla
group near Thailand three days
ago is not in danger and may be
released in a day or two, his aid
agency said Monday.
“There’s no evidence it’s a
kidnap or hostage (situation).
H e’s being held for questioning at
this stage and w e are very
hopeful that w e’ll soon have an
outcom e,” O verseas Service
Bureau ch ief executive Bill
Armstrong said.
Nick Cheesm an, 28, and a
Thai woman were abducted by
guerrillas o f the pro-junta
D em ocratic Karen Buddhist
Army on Friday near Thailand’s
northw estern
border
with
Myanmar, also called Burma,
where rival Karen factions have
been battling.
They were reported to have
been ordered at gunpoint across a
river into M yanm ar after being
caught taking photos near the
Huay Kalok refugee camp, not
far from the Thai border town of
Mae Sot, west of Bangkok.
The Australian Government is
taking no chances, negotiating for
the
im m ediate
release
of
Cheesman and his companion,
whose name is not known.
But Armstrong said it was not

a hostage situation and Cheesman
could be released very soon.
He said there might be some
truth in the story the Karen group
would return Cheesman after he
photographed and docum ented
the conditions of the Democratic
Karen Buddhist Army camp.
“If he does that, they’ll release
him in a day or tw o,” he said.
“We’re told that they’re safe,
that they’re well and there’s no
immediate danger to their lives,”
Armstrong told Channel 9 TV.
Cheesman was working for a
Bangkok-based
organization
Burma Issues, which investigated
human
rights
violations,
Armstrong said.
“There’s no doubt Nick and
his colleague were in the course
of their job. My understanding is
that they were involved in their
job taking photographs of a
village that had been burned.
Cheesman is a teacher who
has been working in the border
camps
for
refugees
from
Myanmar. Friends said he is 28
years old and is believed to be a
resident of Adelaide.
There are an estim ated
100,000 Karen refugees in the
camps, several o f which have
come under attack by Democratic
Karen Buddhist Army troops in
recent weeks.

Saturday and included an aerial
survey by helicopter, Monteiro
told reporters. The inspectors
were expected to return to
Baghdad on Monday.
"E verything went smoothly,”
M onteiro said. "A g a in , small
problems needed clarifications,
but without any interference in
the work.”
M onteiro is Portugal's
am bassador to the United
Nations and chairman of the U.N.
sanctions committee on Iraq. He
said he participated in the
helicopter survey.
The inspectors are searching the
com pounds for information
related to
Iraqi chemical,

biological and nuclear weapons
as well as long-range missiles.
M onteiro is among 20
diplomats chosen by the United
Nations to accompany U.N.
inspectors to eight presidential
compounds.
This was mandated in a Feb. 23
accord between Iraq and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
open the palace complexes that
Iraq earlier had declared offlimits on grounds of national
sovereignty. The presence of the
diplomats is meant to safeguard
Iraq’s dignity.
The visits to presidential sites
began
Thursday
at
the
Radw aniyah com plex outside

Baghdad.
Monteiro said that from the
helicopter over the Tikrit palace
compound, he could see "there
are a lot of things under
construction.” He added: "N o t
everything is finished.”
The inspectors also entered the
main palace building, as they did
at Radwaniyah, he said.
The inspections of palaces and
other sites will go on until the
United Nations is satisfied that
Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction.
Economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq ’s 1990 invasion of
Kuwait will not be lifted until the
weapons are destroyed.

Linklater’s
western
tale comes
to theaters
The true story o f the Newton
Boys is brought to the Silver
Screen in new film.

■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
cstulce@siue.edu
A s I near the end o f my
career as a student, I am starting
to reflect on all of my
experiences. I have enjoyed most
of my time as a student. I even
learned a thing or two in some of
my classes. In others, well, I
didn’t learn as much.
There are two subjects that I
despised having to study. The
first was science. Now, I have
nothing against science. I just
have no interest in biology or
chemistry, just as many scientists
have no interest in the subject of
English. I do recognize that
science is a necessary subject to
teach our young people.
The other subject I hated
taking was history. Now, it
wasn’t just that I w asn’t
interested in the history of our
country or anyone else’s, but I
noticed a disconcerting pattern
as well. Most basic history
classes focus on war. Now, why
is war such an important subject
in the history of a nation?
I would be curious to find out
if a study has been done to find
out if there is any correlation
between teaching grade school
children history and their
tendency towards violent
thinking or behaving. Are the
professors of America teaching
children that war is a way to
solve a major problem? I think
there may be some correlation.
I
have the perfect solution.
History is removed from every
curriculum. And, after a few
generations, a new history can be
made up. But, this can be a
happy history where everyone
gets along. It’s just a thought
to ponder.
By now, I have every history
professor on the campus in an
uproar, and I’m sure they could
give me a list of why my
reasoning is insane.
But, hey, it’s just my opinion.
Take it or shove it.

Richard
Linklater
collaborated on the script with
Clark Lee Walker and Claude
Stanush, basing it on the latter’s
book. Linklater directs with careful attention
to relationships and to period authenticity.
The tone is set in the opening credits,
designed like those of a silent movie.
McConaughey, whose career has not quite
caught fire, does his best work as the canny
mastermind. Other standouts: Ethan Hawke,
the erratic young brother; Vincent D ’Onofrio,
the gang’s strongman; country singer Dwight
Yoakam, the munitions expert.
The filmmakers stress that the events in
“The Newton Boys” actually happened.
Lengthy titles explain the later years of the
principal figures (the brothers lived to old
age). Tip: Stay through the closing titles.
You’ll see Johnny Carson interviewing one of
the Newtons, and another one reciting the
gang’s misdeeds.
The 20th Century Fox release was
produced by Anne Walker-McBay. Rated PG13 for mild profanity, law lessness and
gunfights. Running time: 122 minutes.

“The Newton Boys” stars Vincent D’Onofrio, M atth ew McConaughey, Ethan Hawke and
S keet Ulrich and is directed by Richard Linklater.

■ BY BOB THOM AS
AP WRITER
“I rob banks, that’s what I do.” This is
Willis Newton’s reply to his lady love’s
persistent questions about where he gets the
money to be a big spender.
He is joined in the bank-robbing enterprise
by his three brothers, Joe, Jess and Dock, and
an explosives expert named Brentwood
Glasscock. Together they relieve heartland
banks of their assets during the early 1920s.
These lighthearted bandits actually lived,
and their saga is told in “The Newton Boys,”
a movie in the tradition of “Jesse James”
(the Tyrone Power-Henry Fonda version)
and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.”
While it doesn’t achieve the classic status
of those two, the film is an enjoyable series
of capers, enhanced by a young and
talented cast.
Willis (Matthew McConaughey) returns to
his Texas home after a stretch in the

penitentiary. Neither he nor his brothers, Joe
(Skeet Ulrich) and Jess (Ethan Hawke)
hanker for a life of picking cotton. The same
goes for Dock (Vincent D'Onofrio), also
released from the pen.
T heir future is decided when they
encounter the wily G lasscock (Dwight
Yoakam), who can measure nitroglycerin
with the skill of a hotel bartender. A friendly
banker supplies the gang with a list of banks
possessing square, easy-to-blow safes.
The intricately planned heists proceed
flawlessly, almost baffling local and federal
lawmen. Along the way, Willis falls in love
with Louise Brown (Julianna Margulies). He
rationalizes his profession to her by saying
that he and his brothers don’t kill anyone and
don’t hurt the depositors nor the banks, which
are compensated by insurance firms.
The Newtons’ plans are foiled as banks
install round, impregnable safes. So Willis
devises his most ambitious plan: robbing a
train carrying millions. That proves to be the
gang’s undoing.

C eleb s dig new B eetle
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Beetle mania is sweeping Hollywood,
where flashy luxury cars and sport utility vehicles have been the
preferred mode o f transportation.
Singer Lyle Lovett, actor Larry Hagman and Fleetwood M ac’s John
Me Vie couldn’t wait to be the first celebrities with the new helmet­
shaped $ 15,000 Volkswagen Bug in their driveway.
“I ’ve never had a Beetle before. But I saw this car and I really
wanted it. It’s so cute,” Hagman said before driving off the lot in
Ventura last week in his 1998 silver Bug.
“It’s a little low er profile, which is what I want,” Hagman said.
In Thousand Oaks, McVie picked up his new silver Volkswagen,
while Lovett was the first person to rent a new Beetle on Friday at
Beverly Hills Budget Rent A Car, where stars usually rent MercedesBenz M-Class sport utility vehicles, Corvette convertibles, BMW Z3s,
Jaguar XK8s or Porsche Boxsters.
“We’ve received calls from half the stars in Hollywood who want
to rent the new Beetle. Even though they’re all grown up and driving
Mercedes and Ferraris, this car makes them feel young again,” said
Ken Kerzner, head of the rental-car office in Beverly Hills.
The new versions of the 1960s transportation icon debuted at auto
shows earlier this year. Volkswagen planned to sell 50,000 new
Beetles in the United States the first year, but the target number is now
60,000. Only about 4,000 will have been shipped by Tuesday, which
means only an average of seven cars for each of the com pany’s nearly
600 dealers nationwide.

Original Captain Kangaroo still helping and teaching children

Bob Keeshan, AKA, the original
Captain Kangaroo
HANOVER, N.H. (AP) — Forty-five
years after his Captain Kangaroo character
debuted on NBC, Bob Keeshan has grown
into the elderly character that once required
makeup, a wig and padding.
Keeshan, 70, is now far from the New
York set of Mr. Green Jeans and Mr.
Moose. He’s lived full time in Vermont
since 1990.
And
with
a
huge
list
of
accomplishments behind him, Keeshan
says he’s busier now than he's ever been.
Keeshan’s latest project in Vermont
is serving as spokesman for the Vermont
Children’s Trust Fund, a program that
supports 138 community-based prevention
programs. The trust was established by the
Legislature in 1986 to support after-school
programs, parenting classes and sexual
abuse prevention efforts. It’s funded from
private and federal sources.
It supports programs to prevent child
abuse and neglect, dom estic violence,
alcohol and drug abuse, juvenile
delinquency and other social problems.
“It fills holes that are not filled by the
conventional
governm ent-funded
program s,” Keeshan says. “It’s more
important recently because a lot of those
programs are now not funded.”
The trust helps fulfill Keeshan’s drive to
improve the well-being of children and
families. He also testifies before the
Legislature, speaks around 40 times a year
on issues related to children, writes
children’s books and acts as a creative
consultant on programs.
“It’s my joy,” he says of his work,
seated in the foyer of the Hanover Inn,
where he tries to get the attention of a
youngster bouncing around on a couch as
she waits for her parents.
This year the trust made its way onto the
state income tax forms, an effort legislators
and children’s advocates have been
working on for six years. Now Vermonters
can donate any portion of their tax refund
or payment to the fund by checking off the
children’s trust fund line.
Vermont is the 14th state to include the
trust on its tax forms.
According to Sandy First, the president
of Vermont Children’s Trust Fund, small
states have raised $14,000 through the
check-off and larger states, like Michigan,

have taken in more than $300,000.

Cougar softball fighting inconsistent season, late inning losses
■ BY BR ETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
With a record o f 16-15,
inconsistency has plagued the
SIUE softball team after the first
half of the season.
The Cougars took four out of
six
Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference gam es over the
weekend after falling to Quincy
University twice on Thursday.
SIUE couldn’t sustain a first
inning lead against Quincy in the
opening game of a doubleheader.
Quincy took a 2-1 lead in the
third inning and never looked
back. The Cougars managed to
tack on one more run in the
seventh inning, but fell short 4-2.
Pitcher Jessica Silbe allowed

only five hits in the loss.
Both teams had cold bats for
five innings of the second game.
Quincy broke a scoreless tie in
the bottom of the sixth before
SIUE charged back for two runs
in the top half of the seventh.
With a 2-1 lead, the Cougars
couldn’t close the door. Quincy
rallied to tie the score 2-2 and
send the game into extra innings.
SIUE had another chance to
nail down a victory as they
produced two runs in the top half
of the ninth. The two run lead
was short-lived as Quincy scored
three runs in their half of the
inning to steal a 5-4 win away
from SIUE.
“We didn’t come prepared to
play,”
head
coach
Sandy

Montgomery said. “We played as
poor as we could have played.”
An eight-hit performance by
the Cougars fueled a 9-1
victory over Northern Kentucky
University on Saturday. The fiveinning triumph gave Silbe her
fifth win of the season.
Pitcher Sarah Obrecht had
little trouble in taking her record
to 3-1 with an 11-6 win over

Arena supporters trying to resuscitate plan
ST. PAUL (AP) — Despite a
finding of no wrongdoing from
the state auditor, St. Paul’s deal to
bring NHL hockey to the city
drew more criticism Friday,
putting state money for an arena
in deeper doubt.
Four City Council members
distanced themselves from the
arrangement
negotiated
by
Mayor Norm Coleman. The deal
gives the Minnesota Wild control
over the RiverCentre arena and
its revenue and restricts options
for paying off any state
contribution to the project.
“Either this was the most
naive political act in the history
of M innesota or this was an
outright fraud,” said Council
member Chris Coleman, who is
not related to the mayor.
He and the others want to

delay demolition of the existing
arena, scheduled for next month,
until the lease is renegotiated.
A Wild spokesman said the
team is unwilling to renegotiate.
Team investors expect to get
less than a 3 percent return on
investment in the first five years,
leaving little room for lease
concessions, spokesman Bill
Robertson said.
The lease became an issue
when lawmakers learned it
prevents them from assessing
special arena fees to make the
project self-supporting. The city
would have to reimburse the Wild
for such charges.
Members of Gov. Arne
Carlson’s staff met with St. Paul
officials to devise a financing
plan that would revive flagging
support for the arena.

The main option being
explored was using part of St.
Paul’s half-cent sales tax, now
dedicated to community and art
projects, to help retire arena debt.
Such a plan would shift more of
the financial burden for the arena
onto the city.
Participants said they hope to
have details worked out early
next week.
The scramble to come up with
a financing plan came on the
same day state A uditor Judi
Dutcher said the lease and related
deals violate no state laws.
But even her findings came
with criticism.
Noting the team ’s refusal to
disclose all the inform ation
requested by lawm akers, she
wrote: “The Wild’s need to retain
confidentiality ... to protect its

business interests dramatizes the
problems inherent in public
funding of private ventures. The
public becomes a partner but is
not an informed participant.”
The report said the team ’s
hiring o f M.A. Mortenson Co. as
construction m anager did not
violate the state’s competitive
bidding law because it was for
professional services, which are
not covered under the law.
The $2 million-plus contract
has been criticized because
the company had paid the
team’s $100,000 application fee
to the NHL.
Dutcher also determined there
was no conflict of interest by
former St. Paul City Council
President David Thune, who
worked as a consultant to
Mortenson while voting on the
Wild’s lease in December.

“Because the contract was
between the city and the Wild and
not between the city and
Mortenson, Mr. Thune’s financial
interest was one step removed
from the city,” she wrote.
Senate Majority Leader Roger
Moe, DFL-Erskine and a leading
critic o f the arena, said, “It
just goes back to what many of
us were saying ... it’s not a
good deal.”
The House and Senate have
been divided over arena funding.
The House bonding bill would
give St. Paul a $65 million grant,
the amount requested by the city
and supported by the governor.
The Senate has nothing in its bill.
The city is contributing $30
million plus any shortfall in the
state contribution, and the team ’s
investors have agreed to put in
$35 million.

Tracy Murray 19 for Washington,
which remained tied with New

the eighth playoff berth in the

“He came at me, but we got

Padres say new ballpark
critical to survival of team

Depth paying o ff for Pacers
I NDI ANAPOLI S (AP) —
Depth and health have the
Indiana Pacers three wins away
from matching their franchise
record for victories in a season.
Indiana (49-21) has been able
to use the same starting unit in 66
of its 70 games. Rik Smits has
missed one game and Dale Davis
has missed four.
Meanwhile, Derrick McKey,
Jalen Rose, A ntonio Davis,
Travis Best and Fred Hoiberg all
have taken their turns to
make significant contributions
off the bench.
“We’ve just got to continue to
play as a team. We don’t look at
ourselves as a first vs. second
unit,” said Rose, who had 20
points o ff the bench as the
Pacers defeated Charlotte 133-96
Friday night.
“If w e’re going to do
anything in the playoffs, w e’re
going to need all these guys to
make plays.”
The Pacers haven’t lost two
straight games since consecutive
losses at Utah and Portland on
Dec. 8-10. They were in danger
of that happening Friday after an
86-81 loss at home to Houston on
Wednesday when Indiana shot a
season low 33.8 percent.
“We had a tough loss to come
off of. We came out aggressive
and sustained it over the whole
game,” said Rose, who was 6-of10 from the field and made all
eight o f his free throws
against Charlotte.
“It’s a great character win. We
were playing a team that had won
15 of its last 16 games, coming
into our arena and trying to catch
us in the playoff hunt.

"You’d think it would be a
tight game. But fortunately, for
us, we came out and got the
start that we got and kept up
the
intensity
through
the
whole game.”
Rose led a bench that
outscored C harlo tte’s reserves
63-37. Rose scored his 20 points
in just 23 minutes and Davis had
17 points in 18 minutes.
Reggie M iller and Smits
shared scoring honors for Indiana
with 24 points apiece even
though M iller was ejected for a
flagrant foul with 5:50 left in the
third quarter for an elbow that
struck Vlade Divac.
The game was an enjoyable
one for coach Larry Bird, who
was unhappy with the team ’s
performance against Houston.
“This was a big game. This
was a playoff type game. We
came through and we played
hard,” Bird said. “We lost the
game to Houston. I was really
disappointed in them ... The
second half I thought we were a
little lazy. ... I was a little
embarrassed walking out.”
It was a very different team
against Charlotte, which had left
M arket Square A rena with a
victory in each o f its three
previous visits. Despite having
five of its reserves play 18 or
more minutes, Indiana shot
nearly 60 percent (52-of-87) and
tied its franchise record of only
four turnovers in a game.
“We played as well as we
could possibly play,” Bird said.
“Starters get o ff to a good
start, and your bench comes
in and gives you a lift, you’re
off and running.”

T u e sd a y , M a r c h 31, 1998 ♦

Miller scored Indiana’s first
nine points, giving the Pacers a 92 advantage and the Pacers led
31-20 before Bird began going to
the bench. Charlotte never drew
closer and Indiana kept building
its advantage with its reserves on
the court.
“If we come out like that,
w e’re a terrific basketball team,”
Smits said. “We know we can go
full blast when w e’re out there
and that when we sit down, we’ve
got the guys who can do the job.”
“We have to give Reggie a lot
of credit. He got off to a great
start and we all fed off of that. It’s
fun when everybody comes ready
to play and we sustain the lead,”
said Davis, who has scored 10 or
more points in 23 games. “The
offense and defense played
very well.”
“It was one of those nights
that everything went well. We
had to play well to bounce back
from the Houston loss,” Smits
said. “What was great is we got
the lead with the starters out
there and kept building it with
our bench.”
All 12 Pacers contributed to
Indiana’s highest scoring game
since it defeated Philadelphia
133-88 on April 22, 1994.
Indiana gets another big test
on Sunday when San Antonio
visits Market Square Arena.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — As the
most crucial year in San Diego
Padres history unfolds, the
team’s future will rest as much
with lawyers, politicians and
voters as it does with the
performances of Tony Gwynn,
Ken Caminiti and Kevin Brown.
The city hopes to have a
measure on the Nov. 3 ballot
asking voters to approve a new
downtown ballpark. With it
would come new sources of
cash, the kind needed to keep
Caminiti, Brown, Steve Finley,
and Wally Joyner, whose
contracts expire at season’s end.
Without it? Majority owner
John M oores expects the
measure to pass, and said the
Padres don’t have a contingency
plan if it doesn’t. But the club
says it lost $41 million the last
three years playing in a stadium
better suited for football, where
its lease expires just before the
2000 season.
“It would be horrible to
contemplate the Padres not being
in San Diego, so I’m not going to
think about it,” Moores said.
The Padres and the city have
until June to negotiate a
financing package, and the team
has said it will pay its fair share
of the estimated $250 million
price tag. In the wake of a
controversial deal to keep the
NFL’s Chargers in town through
2020, negotiators know they
must have a package acceptable

to voters — in other-words, one
that doesn’t raise taxes, put the
general fund at risk or have ticket
guarantees.
Through the summer, there
will be public hearings and final
city council action. Then the
vote. The team wants to be in a
40,000-seat ballpark by the
2001 season.
“I would love to be here for
this ballpark,” said Finley, the
center fielder. “I know it hinges a
lot whether San Diego can put
competitive teams on the field.
As far as us players, all we can
do is go out on the field and
play. That’s the only thing we
can control.”
The Padres will try to rebound
from
last
year’s
flop, when they became the
first NL West team to go from
first to worst. Injuries and bad
pitching — a franchise-w orst
4.99 ERA — were to blame for a
76-86 record.
Gwynn needs 220 hits — the
same number he had last year —
to reach 3,000. He’s won four
straight batting titles and eight
overall, tying Honus Wagner for
the NL record. Caminiti is far
healthier than this time last year,
when he played despite coming
off rotator cuff surgery. And
Brown, the new staff ace, could
become
the
Padres’ first
20-game winner in 20 years.
If ever there was a win-now
season, this is it.

Gretzky says
he will return
to rangers
next season
PITTSBURGH (AP) —
Wayne Gretzky will return to
the New York Rangers next
season, although he said the
team will need to make
personnel changes to improve
on a disappointing 1997-98
season.
Despite published reports
that he may want to finish his
career outside New York as the
Rangers try to rebuild their
team, Gretzky told Fox’s John
Davidson that he will be at
Rangers’ training cam p next
season.
“I’ve said it before and
many times after, this is my last
stop and I w on’t play for
another hockey team in this
league,” Gretzky said in an
interview that aired before New
York’s 2-2 tie with Pittsburgh
on Saturday.
“I’m sure the Rangers are
going to make the necessary
changes that will help improve
this team and I plan on being
front and center with that team
next year.”
The Rangers, who have the
highest payroll in hockey, are
currently in 10th place in the
Eastern Conference, six points
behind Ottaw a for the last
playoff spot with nine games
remaining.
Gretzky, who has one year
left in his contract that will pay
him $5 million next season, is
fourth in the league in scoring
this season with 81 points. For
his career, he has 882 goals
and 1,904 assists, best in
NHL history.

Federov
suspended
after checking
NEW
YORK
(AP)
—
D etroit’s Sergei Fedorov was
suspended Saturday for at least
two gam es by the N H L for
checking
A naheim ’s
Jason
Marshall from behind.
Fedorov, who will have a
hearing
M onday,
m issed
Saturday’s game at St. Louis and
also will miss Sunday’s home
game against Buffalo.
The hit came during the first
period Thursday night when
Fedorov, playing his 13th game
since ending a long holdout,
delivered a blind-side hit that sent
Marshall head-first into the
boards. He was given a fiveminute major penalty.

Tar Heels one and out for fourth time this decade
SAN ANTONIO (AP) —
North Carolina has had no
trouble getting to the Final Four
in the 1990s. Closing the deal has
been another matter.
A 65-59 loss to Utah on
Saturday night marked the fourth
time in five tries this decade the
Tar Heels have lost in the NCAA
tournament semifinals, including
the last two years.
“The pain is awkward to
describe,” Ademola Okulaja said.
“One day everybody loves you
and the next day nobody knows
you anymore.”
W hile
top-ranked
North

Carolina couldn’t redeem itself
from last year’s loss to
eventual national champion
Arizona, neither could the
program’s career 3-point leader,
Shammond Williams.
The senior was 1-fo r-13
against Arizona, and vowed to
make a better showing this time
around. Instead, his struggles
continued in the first half against
the Utes as he went 0-for-5,
running his string of Final Four
misses to 17 straight.
“When you don’t have any
more games to play it’s emotional
a little bit, but it wasn’t that bad,”

said Williams. “We’re men, we
take defeat just like we take
winning, that’s the game of
basketball. You have to be mature
throughout both situations. We
are better than a lot of team s.”
The guard finally made a 3pointer with 16:01 left, but
finished 2-for-13 and 3-for-25 his
last two Final Fours.
“It’s not individuals, we win
together and we die and lose
together,” Okulaja said. “It’s
nobody’s fault, it’s all of our
fault. If we played better defense,
things would have gone better.
We played horrible defense.”

Player of the year Antawn
Jamison also had an off night,
going 7-for-19 for 14 points - his
lowest total since Jan. 28. The
first-team A ll-A m erican bent
down and kissed the Final Four
logo at midcourt before he exited
the Alamodome floor.
“I may not have another
chance to get back to the Final
Four,” said Jamison, a junior still
mulling over his North Carolina
future. “Just to make it to the
Final Four two years in a row is
alm ost impossible. Em otions
were just going through me at the
end o f the game.”
