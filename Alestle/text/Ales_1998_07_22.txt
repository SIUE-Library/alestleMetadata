SIUE faculty, staff to
receive 3% pay increase
■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
A ccording to an SIU
Bulletin sent out M onday to
faculty and staff, the SIU Board
of Trustees has approved a
salary increase plan for SIUE
em ployees not represented
through collective bargaining.
“Salary increases for those
employees who are members of
collective bargaining units will
be determined through normal
negotiations,”
said
SIUE
chancellor, David Werner in the
letter.
Effective July 1, 1998, the
plan provided employees with a
3 percent salary increase to be
distributed on a m erit basis.
Individual salary increases will
be recom m ended by chairs,

deans and directors “in accord
with existing policy and
practice” said the letter.
The letter also states that
the Broad, which approved this
measure July 11, has approved a
distribution of up to an
additional 2 percent increase
later in the fiscal year to
“address matters of salary
equity.” D istribution of the
amount will depend on SIU
president, Ted Sanders approval
of the equity plans Werner will
send upon consultation with
“the
appropriate
cam pus
constituencies.”
The inclusion o f the
additional 2 percent increase to
address matters of equity will
follow W erner’s consultation
with UPBC and the Faculty
Senate Executive Committee in
June.

University Housing to receive new recycling materials
through Dept, of Commerce and Community Affairs grant
■ BY DANIELLE BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
Today students will be given a chance to help the
environment.
In an e-mail sent out on Monday, students and staff
will be able to participate at a recycling booth open today
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The booth will be located at the Cougar Village
Com m ons B uilding. The booth will be staffed by

Environmental Health and Safety. It’s purpose is to help
promote recycling at Cougar Village.
At the booth there will be complimentary T-shirts
and mugs, as well as other informational materials.
University Housing, which is currently involved in
recycling paper, plastic, glass and aluminum products
through their own recycling bins, is hoping the project
will enhance the current recycling program.
Due to a grant received by EHS from the Department
of Com m erce and Com m unity A ffairs, University
Housing will add eight outdoor recycling stations. New

recycling containers and a com pactor were also
purchased.
In addition, videos promoting recycling were also
purchased and will be shown to University Housing
residents via the local cable station utilized by University
Housing. The videos were purchased through grant
funding.
For more information about the booth or recycling
and the environment at SIUE contact Environmental
Health and Safety at ext.3584.

Life’s little cheering section
All my life I've been trying to impress my father. I
don’t know whether he knows it or not, but half the things I
do, win or fail are to impress myself and him. I wanted so
badly to be a daddy’s girl but the position was already filled
by my oldest sister Denise. Nearly all the times I got angry
Danielle with my father was because I was jealous of Denise. I used
to wonder why all the baby stories he told about Denise were
Belton
so cute and all mine involved me screaming, crying, making
a specticale of myself, or it involved something embarrassing that I don’t
even tell people outside o f my family about. I used to wonder why he
would say 1 was the one he understood the least or was unpredictable
when 1 was the only one of my three sisters that always told him what was
going on in my life.
I fished for compliments. I once made him go to an open house my
school had when I was in the eighth grade hoping he’d see all the good
things I did and finally compliment me. He complained the whole time.
I ’m sure he didn’t mean for it to sound that way, but eighth grade was the
same year I was going through a really rough period with being a “social
outcast.” A lot of the criticism my father gave me didn’t mean to come
out the way it sounded. I was going through my teen years wanting back
the father that used to come in my bedroom in the morning and give me
a kiss before he left for work. Or the same guy that used to tell me funny
stories at breakfast about him and his brothers. Instead I had this guy that
everytime I turned around was complaining about how I blew my nose
and chewed potato chips. I ’m thinking, who cares about how I blow my
nose, 1 have no friends and bad acne. But when I did get that “one atta
boy,” or that compliment, I was so happy. “I must have done good,” I’d
think, “Daddy actually noticed.”
Sometimes we were both hard to deal with. I was a teenager, which
is horrid enough on its own, with hormones and with a knack o f looking
extremely corny and being very sensitive about it. I would go from
normal to a sobbing, boo-hooing creature in a matter of minutes. And he
never knew what ju st happened. We would just be talking and the next
thing he’d know I’d be crying. People think I’m a screaming mimi now,
my parents had to live with it. When you’re a teenager you hate how you
look, how you dress, how you live and life in general, it didn't help when
my father would tell me I didn’t need that extra plate o f spaghetti.
But even as upset as I got, I wanted to have a close relationship with
him. I had an extremely close relationship with my mother and since we
were all living under the same roof, I wanted the same with him. So I
never stopped telling him I loved him or kissing him and hugging him,
no matter how angry he made me. He’s my father, and I love him. And
even though he didn’t say the same back, I knew he did, and left it alone.
My father hadn’t told me he loved me for years. I couldn’t remember
the last time it had happened. I had to be young, I don’t remember. It just
stopped. Then after we made it through my screaming mimi stage I went
to college, and he told me after I went away that he loved me. I don't
think he realizes to this day how much that means to me to hear him say
that. It was like all I ever wanted was his full attention and now I got it.
And now I get a lot more compliments mixed in with the constructive
criticism. It doesn’t feel like he’s just harping on me any more, or that I’m
putting in all this work to be a daddy’s girl and h e’s not even noticing. I
think he was so hard on me just because he was so concerned about me,
because he was so scared for me when I wasn’t even worried about
myself. Therefore, I feel sorry for people who have strained or
deteriorated relationships with their families. As angry as my father can
make me, I couldn't imagine life without him. I couldn’t imagine life
without either of my parents. When no one else would be there they were
there, and to this day, if I need something, they are there. They might be
grumbling about it of course, but they’re there. They’re my little cheering
section in a world of madness.

Commentary----------------------- ----------------Saving the memory of Edwardsville’s past
Memory is a delicate thing.
Throughout history people have
been keenly aware of how short
it is. They have invented
methods of remembering and
reminding others o f the deeds
and accomplishments of their
forebearers.
M onum ents,
pyram ids, statues, paintings,
poems, written records, have
been created in an attempt to
remind the future of what was
accomplished in the past.
Yet, for all its attempts to
be remembered, the past is soon
forgotten. Most of the greatest
people and some of the greatest
ideas have already been wiped
from the public mind. Some of
this history is preserved by a
handful of archivists, historians
and others who believe we have
something to learn from the
past.
Our world is littered with
statues of m en and women
whose deeds are long forgotten.
Look in the parks and on the
grounds of public buildings.
Faces are preserved, but the

history of deeds accomplished
are forgotten, or at best have
become a blur.
One such artifact is located
on the second floor o f the
M adison County Courthouse.
Hanging on the wall inside the
courtroom of Judge Edward C.
Ferguson is a 1922 painting,
which painstakingly reminds us
of the Edw ardsville which
existed follow ing the G reat
War. C.A.R. Benedict created
an aerial view of the town that
details every road, every
building, every open space as it
existed.
Many o f those buildings
are still recognizable. Others
are replaced. The Bohm
Building is there, but the
Schwartz Building is not.
Purcell Street is there, but the
new County A dm inistration
Building is not. Hotz Lumber
Company is there, but the
Superlot is not.
Time erodes even this
memory. A piece of the canvas
has already been tom away.

Cracks are forming as hands
touch and heads bounce against
the painted surface. The canvas
bows away from the top of its
frame.
This
unprotected
artifact, this time capsule, this
memory, is being destroyed by
a public which is unaware of its
value.
The time has com e to
immediately restore and protect
this remarkable work. C.A.R.
Benedict’s painting should be
temporarily removed from the
courthouse, expertly restored,
covered with Plexiglas (or other
suitable material) and put back
in public view.
The
M adison
County
Historical Society, having been
made aware of the condition of
the painting, is now moving
quickly to save this time
capsule before further damage
is done.

the mettle of the Little Dragon.
The Little Dragon was not found
wanting. Lee was small in stature (5’8”
and around 140 pounds), but he never
lacked in enthusiasm. Bruce Lee sensed
fame was ahead for him.
But Lee was not always so serious.
More than a few times, he joked that he
chewed gum because “a lot of men smoke
but Fu Manchu.” He also scorned showy
martial arts stunts such as board breaking,
saying “Boards don’t hit back,” which was
u soon to become a catch-phrase in “Enter
the Dragon.”

■ BY LEIGH RAMSEY
LIFESTYLE REPORTER
What do Lord Byron, James Dean,
Jesus and Bruce Lee have in common?
All died tragically young and, some
might say, poised at the peak of their
earthly fame.

« € R e T « £ R £ T3e LITTLC
■DRAGONS
Jun Fan Lee, named “Bruce” by a
hospital nurse, was born in San Francisco
on November 27, 1940—in The Year of the
Dragon and the hour of the dragon (from 6
a.m. to 8 a.m.).
When Bruce Lee was one year old, he
and his parents returned to Hong Kong.
Following in his father's footsteps (his
father was a performer with the renowned
Cantonese Opera Company), Bruce Lee
acted in more than 20 film s in Asia
throughout his childhood, taking the stage
name of “Little Dragon Lee.”
At the age of thirteen, after being
beaten up by a street gang in Hong Kong,
Bruce Lee began to take kung fu lessons,
training under Sifu Yip M an, a master of
kung fu.
Then, at nineteen, Bruce was sent by
his parents to the United States. In Seattle,
Wash., Lee earned his high school diploma
and began teaching m artial arts in
backyards and city parks. He also later
enrolled as a philosophy student at the
University of Washington, where he met
his future wife.
In the fall of 1963, Lee opened up the
iirst Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Seattle.
(Note: Lee preferred the Southern Chinese
spelling and pronunciation “gung fu” to
“kung fu.”) And, not one to follow the
rules, Bruce began to teach martial arts to
people of any race, including Caucasians
and blacks.

Certainly
"Bruce
Lee
popularized m artial arts to
Americans. He also alienated
many of his countrymen;
martial arts, then, was the
O riental secret," according to
Rich Hauschild, a Graduate
Assistant for Campus Recreation
and a Tae Kwon Do instructor.
G iving
impressive
martial arts demonstrations in
1965, Lee was
spotted
and
asked to do a
screen-test.

IN T C R C C P T IN G
F IS T ”
Several months after he started teaching
at a newly-opened Jun Fan Gung Fu
Institute in O akland, Calif., Lee was
confronted by a leading kung fu master in
the Chinatown Community. This man
challenged Lee: If he won, Lee would
either close his school or stop teaching
non-Asians. D ecim ating his opponent
easily, Bruce later wondered why it took
him so long to win.
Thus was bom Jeet Kune Do, or JKD,
Lee's martial arts system and philosophy.
Many people, like Hauschild, believe that
JKD is Bruce Lee's defining work. "If you
want to know about Bruce Lee, you don’t
have to watch his m ovies-just read T he
Tao of Jeet Kune Do.' That is the heart and
soul of Bruce Lee."
Jeet Kune Do utilizes techniques from
many styles o f fighting (including

a

American Boxing, Thai Kick Boxing, and
others). Lee said he developed JKD
because “To me 99 percent of the whole
business o f Oriental self-defense is
baloney. It’s fancy jazz. It looks good, but
it doesn’t work.”

T H £ G R G A T -O K A TO
YCARS
In 1966 Lee wowed Am erican
television audiences with his martial skills,
playing Kato on the short-lived series "The
Green Hornet." The Little Dragon’s acting
career in the states had begun.
W hen Bruce and Brandon Lee traveled
to Hong Kong in late 1971, they found that
Kato had becom e a superstar. But
Hollywood had yet to move past its narrow
characterization o f Asians and their
culture—and the show was cancelled.

A M A R T IA L A R T IS T FIR ST ,
AM A C TO R S e C O N D
From 1967 to 1971, Lee landed mostly
minor acting roles. Meanwhile, he gave
private lessons to Steve M cQueen,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew
Alcindor) and others. He very often gave
free, or inexpensive, lessons to those who
showed interest but were too poor to pay.
W hile recovering, in 1970, from a
severe back injury, Lee dictated to his wife
the training methods and philosophy of
Jeet Kune Do, which was published after
his death, in 1975. Doctors had told him he
would never kick again.
The racism still evident in 1960s era
H ollyw ood and much of the view ing
public, as well as the back injury, tested

DRAGON, DRAGON
B U R N IN G B R IG H T
By July 1971, Lee was filming “Fists of
Fury.” The same year, it opened to great
reviews and mobs of fans, grossing more
than $3.5 million in less than three weeks.
The follow ing year, “The Chinese
Connection” was released in Hong Kong
to greater acclaim than “Fists of Fury.”
But 1972 was probably the banner year
for Bruce Lee in movie-making. He wrote,
starred in and directed “The Return of the
D ragon”— shooting on location, for
example, in Rome’s Coliseum with Chuck
Norris. This movie, perhaps more than any
other, solidified Bruce Lee’s box office
clout and spawned Norris’ acting career
That same year, Lee began filming “Game
o f Death” with Abdul-Jabbar.
"From his movies, Bruce Lee was an
Asian hero. He wasn't the guy digging
ditches or mining coal. He fought for good
and he was Asian. Today his movies,
especially 'Enter the Dragon,' are still
popular," Hauschild believes.
In February 1973, production started on
“Enter the Dragon”— the quintessential
martial arts movie of the 1970s and the one
which helped kick off the kung fu craze.
This movie was the first-ever venture
between the U.S. and Hong Kong film
industries. “Enter the Dragon" premiered
on August 24, 1973 in Hollywood, and
went on to gross more than one hundred
million dollars at the box office, a thenrare feat— especially for a Hong Kong
martial arts film.
Yet Bruce Lee didn’t live to complete
“Game o f D eath” or to enjoy the
phenom enal success of “E nter the
Dragon." Neither did he live to see his two
children grow up— or his son Brandon’s
untimely death while filming “The Crow”
in 1994. Many people have insisted that
there was a conspiracy surrounding the
deaths o f the Lee family’s men, but no one
knows for sure.
However, “Martial artists,” Hauschild
says, “will remember Bruce in a different
way from non-m artial artists. M artial
artists will remember how he influenced
their community ... teaching us how to be
fluid, not rigid, how to be open-minded
and to never stop learning.” Thirty-two
short years and a few complete films later,
on July 20, 1973, Bruce Lee the man was
dead. But Bruce Lee the legend had just
been born.

F re n ch ex c h an g e s tu d e n t,
G uy D u p o n t sum m ed up the
celeb ratio n o f F ra n c e ’s victory
in the W orld C up like this:
“The last tim e F rance saw
th a t m any people in th e streets
c e le b ra tin g w as a f te r th e
lib eratio n of Paris.”
D u p o n t was in F rance for
th e sem ifinal an d final gam e,
w atch in g w ith 15 frie n d s
an d fam ily, in c lu d in g his
g ra n d m o th er w ho, n ev e r to o k
in te re st in th e sp o rt, at his

hom e in n o rth France.
“A t th a t m o m en t w e really
w ere proud o f being F rench,”
D u p o n t said. “ P eople w ere ju st
happy to be there. I w as talking
to p e o p le w ho I w ould
norm ally be afraid of.”
D u p o n t described th e ro ads
as being flooded w ith peo p le
d riv in g to local to w n s a n d
having a good tim e.
“I ’m n o t w h at you say is a
big soccer fan, b u t w hile in
France, you had to be,” D u p o n t
said w ith a big smile.
T h e re
w e re
about
19

gam e, and this is w hen D u p o n t
felt th a t a victory was possible.
B ut playing B razil, th e soccer

“W e w ere playing so well,
and w e did w hat w e h a d to do
to b e a t a te a m as g o o d as

W hen asked w hy A m erican

D u p o n t had this to say:
“A m erica has lots o f sp o rts
w ith d e ep ro o ts th a t th ey
