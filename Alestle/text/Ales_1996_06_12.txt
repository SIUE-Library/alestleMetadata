Scorched cross placed in Glen Carbon yard

Jurors decide Exxon deserves
$250 million

GLEN CARBON— The FBI and Glen Carbon police are
investigating the incident of a scorched cross at the home of
Antonia Valentine,23, and her fiancee Keith Ellis, 30.
Ellis said an effort to burn the three-foot cross failed,
only charring it slightly on the bottom. The couple who
moved from Nebraska to the Madison County town, were
told they could raise their two children in Glen Carbon
without fear of violence.
Along with the cross, someone threw a rock through
their daughters window. The couple said they may move
because of the incident.

International

Burglar steals tractor from treatment plant

Refugee ship remains stranded near Ghana
A rusty Russian freighter carrying hundreds of Liberian refugees
remained stranded at sea Monday after Ghana again refused to let it
dock.
The Zolotisa has been searching for a West African port of
refuge since it left Monrovia, the Liberian capital, two weeks ago
with 450 people fleeing the country’s civil war. Ghana’s minister of
foreign affairs said the ship, which was drifting off the coast of the
western Ghanaian harbor of Takoradi, would not be allowed to dock.
Last month, a leaking Nigerian freighter loaded with 2,000
Liberian refugees was turned away repeatedly before Ghana—
bowing to international pleas—allowed it to dock.

COLLINSVILLE— Police are investigating the theft of a
tractor from the city’s waste water treatment plant.
The John Deere tractor, valued at $7,032, was in a shed
behind a fence on the plant grounds at 300 Simpson St. State
Park Place. It was stolen sometime between 8:30 p.m. Friday
and 11 a.m. Saturday
The tractor was a replacement for another that was
stolen in 1989, Public Works Director Brett Hanke said.
According to the police report, someone stopped
along southbound lanes of Interstate 255, cut a perimeter
fence around the plant and broke a lock on a chain link fence
that guarded the shed. The thief apparently drove the tractor,
which had keys in its ignition, through the chain link fence
and loaded it onto a trailer on the interstate.

It is a crazy world we live in— the news at a glance
This is a crazy world.
As I was watching the news
about a m onth ago I could not
help but become sickened by
the story the new scaster was
reporting.
It seems that a little boy was
taken away and his m other and
father were arrested because
their neighbors had reported
that the child was being beaten
by the parents and it w asn’t a
Tuesday.
It seems th at the parents of
this said boy beat him on
Tuesdays, and when the neigh­
bors h eard scream ing on
Wednesday, they were alarm ed
and called the police.
Only in the Midwest would a
neighbor report a case of child
abuse only after they realize
th at the boy next door was
receiving a b eating on the
wrong day.
W hat is wrong with people
these days, are we so afraid of
becoming involved in som eone
else’s problems, that we will let
an innocent child be abused
day in and day out, before tak­
ing action?
As a fo rm er education
major, I have been trained that
teachers, neighbors and anyone
affiliated with a child they sus­
pect is being abused has a
responsibility to that child to take action as soon as
possible.
By the time th at the neighbors took the initiative
to call the police, the saying, “ Too little,too late”
comes to mind. To that child, the dam age had
already been done, not only physically but also m en­
tally.
A nother news story that really got under my skin
was the story about the FBI files of 341 Republicans
and m em bers of form er W hite H ouse adm inistra­
tions that were found in the W hite House.
The W hite H ouse said it was an accident and that
the files were taken by an A rm y officer who was try­
ing to gain perm anent passes to the W hite House.
I’m sorry, but one does not accidentally obtain 341
personal files. A ccidents like that just d o n ’t happen.
A nd no m atter what political party I endorse, if the
tables were turned, Bill Clinton and the D em ocrats
would be upset as well.
If I were some of those people, 1 would be m ore
than a little perturbed at Bill Clinton right now. I
agree with m ost people when they say that the
Clinton adm inistration needs to m ake a public apol­
ogy to the people involved as well as the Am erican
people. H e and the others involved should consider
themselves lucky if a suit is not filed by those w ho’s
files were recovered.
Besides the child abuse case, there is a story that
truly left me disheartened and it involved our own
area.
In G len C arbon Monday, A ntonia Valentine woke
up to find a burning cross on her front lawn and a
brick through her six-year-old daughter’s window.
Valentine said in the Belleville News Democrat
Tuesday that she moved to G len C arbon to get away
from drugs and violence. I guess she didn’t move far
enough.
W hen I heard this I thought, what year is it again?

en many times.
In the 1920s, it was seen
alm ost as if it were a country
club. W omen w ere involved
heavily in the KKK and even
had their own KKK branch
called, the WKKK.
According to the author of
the book, B ehind the M ask o f
Chivalry, the Ku Klux Klan of
the 20s recruited m ore m em ­
bers and am assed m ore power
in com m unity than any Klan
before its time or since. ^
No m atter if it is the K K K ’s
symbol that they are back or
not, we as a com m unity should
know what is happening and
stop it before it spreads any
further.
I for one d o n ’t want to see
things like this occur any m ore
in o u r com m unity. H ere a*
S1UE we say we believe in
diversity, m aybe we should
spread that belief to the rest of
our community.
This incident is not only a
reflection of our community,
but also of o u r university since
it happened three miles from
our institution.
Some of Valentine’s neigh­
bors did try to reach out to her
after the incident and their
effort is to be noted, but like in
the case of the little abused
boy, it was too little, too late. Valentine plans to move
as soon as she can afford to do so. Which is unfortu­
nate, but expected.
So once again, the ignorant get th eir way.
However, their days are num bered as long as there
are people diverse enough and open-m inded enough
to stop them , before som ething like this happens
again in our area.

This can’t be 1996. I thought our country was past
segregation, white supremacy and dressing up in
white sheets and riding horses. I was evidently
wrong.
It truly upsets me to see that racism is alive and
kicking in the U.S. considering all of the diversity,
technology and advancem ents that we have m ade
over the years.
We have come a long way since the days of the
Civil War when m en ran around on horses

Edwardsville’s Target donates
$2,000 grant to Arts & Issues
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
The 1996-97 A rts & Issues series got a m onetary boost
recently when the new Target in Edwardsville gave the
university a $2,000 grant. Target is continuing a 30-year
com m itm ent of com m unity support, according to m anager
Shirley Ashauer. (CQ )
M ore specifically, the A rts & Issues series has been
supported by the A lton Target store for the last three or four
years, she said.
“As a family store, our goal is to provide both financial
and volunteer support to com m unity program s that help
strengthen families,” she said.
R ichard Walker, A rts & Issues coordinator, said he was
happy to learn that the Edwardsville Target will m aintain the
support begun by the A lton Target.
“ In prior years, we were in Alton's region and now with
the new Target, w e’ll be in Edw ardsville’s region. I was glad
to learn that even with new people m aking the decisions,
w e’ll still get support,” he said.
A shauer said that Target sponsors family-oriented
activities, so the recent controversy over Sarah B rady’s
appearance did not affect the store.
“We sponsor art and music activities that will benefit kids
who might not otherw ise have an opportunity to experience
som ething like th at,” she said.
The grant will be used to bring the Tannahill Weavers to
the university Sept. 25. Nam ed after a weaving group from
their hom etow n in Scotland, the Tannahill Weavers play
Celtic music on bagpipes and fiddles.
M inneapolis-based Target stores are quality discount
retailers with 645 stores in 32 states coast to coast. It is the
largest division of D ayton H udson C orporation, one of the
n ation’s leading retailers. In 1994, Target gave m ore than $8.8
million to m ore than 2,000 non-profit organizations
nationwide.

Special summer concert
to help Arts & Issues
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor

The 1996-97 A rts & Issues series may not start until
Sept. 5, but R ichard W alker is hoping to fill M eridian
Hall with a special sum m er concert in a couple weeks.
Vocalist and keyboardist Tania M aria will be in
town Saturday, June 22, to wow the audience with her
blend of Brazilian music and jazz. T he award-winning
artist has recorded 19 albums. She and her bassist, St.
Louisan Tom Kennedy, will be playing selections from
their new CDs, “Bluesilian” (C Q ) and “Basses
Loaded.” (CQ )
“1 don’t think her new CD will even be in the stores
by then,” W alker said, “unless it comes out just this
w eek.”
H er opening act will be Reggie Thom as’ O G D Trio.
Thom as is an assistant professor in the dept, of Music
and is well-known for his band.
The sum m er concert is a first for the A & I series,
one that W alker hopes will be a success.
W alker said the concert will serve as a fundraiser to
benefit the A rts & Issues Endow m ent Fund, which
helps pay for speaker and artist fees. A & I gets other
funding from private sources such as contributions and
grants and from state money. O ther money is earned
through advertising and ticket sales.
The series will celebrate 12 years of program m ing
this fall.

“So students do not have a say in the m atter?” Hayes asked.
“Not between labor and m anagem ent,” N eher said.
“A re you going to ride the bus?” Hayes asked again.
“N o,” N eher said.
N eher went on to say that the university was governed by a
com plex set of laws and state and federal regulations
prohibiting informing the custom er during negotiations.
Student Body President C hristopher Nance once again put
emphasis on the better value of having MCT, but with concerns
focusing on communications.
“It’s a better deal. T here are some setbacks— one being the
buses not going up the upper level 500 side. MCT said that
during 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. it was impossible for them to go up in
those areas,” Nance said. “ I’m also concerned with the
breakdow n of com m unications—how the news about the buses
was leaked out by the labor union, also how students where left
in the d ark.”
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs N arbeth Em m anuel did
attend Friday’s studerit senate meeting. However, he did not
address student governm ent or students and only observed.
O ther issues that were discussed at the student governm ent
meeting included:
A recom m endation from S tudent Body President
C hristopher Nance for the university to create a student
advisory board for University Police. The purpose would be to
create a b etter understanding betw een students and the
University Police.
The senate approved of A udrey Smith and A zhar U m er
for the pasition of public relations and financial chair,
respectively.

The Earth rotates around it.
It has been a source of light
and energy since the
beginning of time. The
ancient Greeks worshiped it
in the form of Apollo.
The sun.
The Earth is still rotating
around it. It is still a source of
light and energy. People may
still "worship" it, but doctors
are saying that may not be
such a good idea anymore
because of the rising
incidents of skin cancer.
Why should I worry about
skin cancer?

Although skin cancer can
be attributed to other factors
other than ultraviolet

Hawasli, a pathologist at St.
Elizabeth Medical Center,
malignant melanoma is not
only the most serious form of
skin cancer, but it is also one
of the cancers that doctors
know the least about.
"It's one of the weirdest
tumors we know of in a
human," Dr. Hawasli said.
Dr. Hawasli explained that
malignant melanoma can be
related to sun exposure, but it
can also be related to other
variables such as whether or
not there is a family history of
this type of cancer.
Melanoma arises from the
neuroendocrine glands,
which are the glands located
just beneath the bottom, or
basal, layer of the skin. These
glands create chemicals that
are related to melanoma.
"For a reason we don't

"If you catch them early,
they are curable."
radiation from the sun,
research has shown that the
sun does play an important
role in the development of
skin cancer.
And, according to the
American Academy of
Dermatology, the incidents of
malignant melanoma are
rising faster than any other
cancer. In women, the
incidents of malignant
melanoma are rising at a rate
second only to lung cancer.
O f all cancers in men,
melanoma-related deaths are
rising the most rapidly.

know, they (the chemicals)
cause malignant melanoma.
But we do know for sure it is
related to sun exposure and
we know some families have
it more than others," he said.
However, one fact is
definite. According to the
1991 Cancer Journal for
Clinicians published by the
American Cancer Society,
sunlight may not be a causal
factor in all melanomas, but
it is a variable. However, it is
a factor that can be modified

they are curable," Dr.
Hawasli said.
The two other forms of
skin cancer, squamous cell
carcinoma and basal cell
carcinoma, are not lifethreatening. Squamous cell
carcinoma affects the
uppermost layer of the skin. It
can spread to deeper layers
of the skin but not to other
organs as malignant
melanoma can. Basal cell
carcinoma affects the basal
layer of the skin and usually
does not spread.
Although these two types
are not deadly, they can be
costly. Once a suspicious
lesion is spotted, a doctor
will usually recommend that
it be removed so that it can
be examined under a
microscopic for possible
malignant cells.
"And very often they cut
them out because they don't
know if it's cancer. So it's
kind of a treatment and
diagnosis," Dr. Hawasli said.
And, he added, surgery can
be required more than one
time.
"They all come back. If
you don't remove them
completely, they will come
back," he said.
So can a person be "safely"
exposed to the sun?

"There is no magic
number," Dr. Hawasli said.
"It is a cumulative risk," he
added. "Every time you get a
little bit of damage."
According to Dr. Obert

Lay, a general surgeon at St.
Elizabeth Medical Center in
Granite City, everyone has a
limit when it comes to
exposure to the sun's rays
before a skin cancer
develops.
"The radiation adds up
from the moment you're
born," Dr. Lay said.
What exactly is so dangerous
about the sun?

The sun emits three types
of ultraviolet radiation rays.
UV-A rays do not fluctuate

much rarer in individuals
with darker skin as the
pigmentation in the skin is
related to the amount of
melanin in the skin.
"The whiter you are, then
the more damaged you get,"
Dr. Hawasli said.
But, he added, although
skin cancer is much rarer in
people with darker skin
pigmentation, this greater
amount of melanin does not
guard against skin cancer
completely. What the darker
pigmentation does do,
however, is make it harder to

much in intensity and can
contribute to wrinkling of the
skin and sunburn. UV-B rays
are the most common cause
of sunburn and are more
intense during the summer
and in high altitude areas or
areas close to the equator.
UV-C rays, the most
dangerous type of radiation,
are filtered by the ozone
layer and do not reach the
earth's surface.
According to Dr. Aiman
Hawasli, the body does have
its own protection against
ultraviolet radiation.
"Melanin usually protects
against the sun's rays," Dr.
Hawasli said.
Therefore, skin cancer is

detect any irregularly colored
or changing lesions that may
develop on sun-exposed skin
that could be warning signs
of skin cancer.
So what should I look for on
my own skin?

The most important things
to look for are changing or
developing lesions.
Lay explained that any
change in a lesion on the
skin could indicate potential
skin cancer.
"The magic word is change:
size, shape and color
changes," Dr. Lay said.

What about tanning beds?
Indoor tanners can catch artificial rays in a
controlled environment. While sunlight contains
an almost proportionate amount of ultraviolet A
and ultraviolet B wavelengths, indoor tanning
lamps contain mostly ultraviolet A wavelengths
and only a small amount of ultraviolet B
wavelengths.
Tanning appliances can be used for medical
purposes (such as for psoriasis), but the majority of
tanning facilities are used for recreational
purposes.
However, some physicians believe that indoor
tanning is just as dangerous as outdoor tanning.
The American Academy of Dermatology attributes
part of the sharp increase in skin cancer over the
last two decades to the 300 percent increase in the
use of tanning beds in the five years beginning in
1980.
The owner of a local tanning facility, who has
also researched the effects of indoor tanning, said
that doctors' research has been unable to connect
skin cancer with indoor tanning. The owner also
stressed that tanning facilities in Illinois must
follow strict safety regulations.
"There are a series of things that we have to
adhere to in order to stay in business," she said.
In fact, Illinois is one of 26 states that must
follow the strict regulations outlined by the Federal
Food and Drug Administration. These regulations
mandate that tanning facilities follow certain
cleaning regulations as well as require clients to
wear protective eyewear and wait 24 hours
between tanning sessions.
Physicians and the tanning industry do agree on
one point: Whether tanning inside or outside, wait
24 hours between exposure times and do not
combine indoor and outdoor tanning within short
periods of time.

Cartoon legacy makes big screen debut
(Press Release)
Set in a rom antic time when anything seemed possible,
P aram o u n t P ic tu re ’s “The P h an to m ” brings Lee F alk’s
internationally acclaimed comic strip superhero to the screen
with swashbuckling high adventure and escapist fun.
D eep in the jungled island of Bengalla lies four centuriesold secrets the outer world only suspects exist. The Skulls of
Touganda—one of gold, another of silver and the third of rare
green jad e— are ancient relics of incalculable value and
extraordinary power.
According to legend, they harbor an energy source one
thousand times greater than anything known to civilized man.
The person who unearths the skulls from their hiding places
around the world and brings them together will be in control
of unprecedented power.
The ruthless X ander Drax, and the bloody-thirsty Pirates of
the Sengh B rotherhood, seek to control the Skulls. But their
quest for unbridled pow er takes them into the mysterious
jungle dom ain of Bengalla's other legend— a m asked figure of
mystery, garbed in purple, who for over 400 years has served as
p rotector of the jungle. Believed im mortal by natives and
dismissed as a m yth by outsiders, he is both feared and
respected as The G host Who Walks—The Phantom!

Back to basics in primitive clay at
SIUE SummerArts '96 Workshop
(U N S)
Students of the Primitive Clay workshop, taught this sum m er at
Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville by A rt and Design
Professor Paul Dresang, are learning the art of ceramics with as little
technology as possible. Practicing the ceram ic techniques that existed
before the days of electricity is a “great hands-on experience for
students,” Professor D resang said.
S tudents not only created original artw o rk , b u t they are
responsible for the entire ceramics process. O nce the artw ork is
created and glaze is applied, the creation is then placed in a kiln to
m elt the glaze. The kiln is sim ilar to a bread oven and scrap wood is
used for the fire. “Students also get to experience building many
different kinds of kilns and w ithout the m odern uses of electricity or
gas jets, the kilns can create enough heat to fire the works,” Professor
D resang said.
A fter the artw ork is rem oved from the kiln it is placed in sawdust,
which changes the color and pattern of the glaze. The work is then
placed in a tub of w ater to cool and later scrubbed clean of existing
residue. This com pletes the raku process. “ I think part of the fun is
that you never have one hundred percent control over how the
sawdust changes the color of the glaze,” th e art professor said. “T h at’s
really part of the charm of this process.”
The class has been studying the prim itive works and m ethods of
m any d ifferent cultures including A frican, In donesian, S outh
Am erican, N orth A m erican and Indian. The Primitive Clay class
recently viewed many slides of cerem onial masks from various
cultures and the next project is to create a cerem onial mask of their
own.
The Primitive Clay w orkshop is being conducted as part of the
annual Sum m erA rts program at SIU E, which brings together various
activities in the arts, including music concerts and stage perform ances,
for sum m er enjoyment.

Two high school talents sign on with women’s basketball
Shastine Mosley and Barbara Washington both signed national letters of intent to be a Cougar for this year
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor

File Photo /Alestle
Head Coach Wendy Hedberg hopes her recruits can help out the Cougar squad
from a 10-10 GLVC record and take them to the next level of achievement.

The wom en's basketball team continued the long list of C ougar recruits,
when they signed two players to help in the paint and the backcourt.
H ead Coach Wendy H edberg m ade it official last week that Shastine
Mosley, of Sullivan, and B arbara Washington, of W elston, Mo., have signed
national letters of intent to play for the Cougars this winter.
The 5-foot-8-inch Mosely scored 11.2 points p er game as a point guard
for Sullivan last season, plus dished out 4.0 assists per game.
During her high school career, she broke the record for three-pointers
m ade in a season with 58 and three-pointers m ade in a game with seven.
“Shastine has the ability to play either guard spot, but we will use her at
point. She handles the ball well and sees the floor well. She is an excellent
passer and has the potential to shoot the three,” H edberg said.
The o th er signee hopefully will add some depth under the basket.
W ashington, a 5-10 forward, averaged 16.1 points and 11.1 rebounds per
game last season, plus shot 63 percent from the field.
She led her team last year by pulling down 256 rebounds and was second
by scoring 371 points.
“B arbara gives us another rebounder,” H edberg said. “She will fit in well
as a power forward and she is really strong with her back to the basket.”
Washington will also be throwing the shot and discus for the SIU E track
and field program next year.
These recruits will hopefully fill the holes from last year’s GLVC 10-10
team and 15-11 overall mark.
The Cougars lost point guard Terri Evans to graduation and if Mosely
can ever turn into anything like Evans, then she will som ething special to
this team.

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out the
Bulls are a really good basketball team. Having
only lost one game in the entire playoffs proves
they are also very good under pressure.
This team finds ways to win. Even when
they shoot under 40 percent, they turn to their
defense and none other
than M ichael Jordan to
help them through.
So, one could easily

greatness, but the leagues weakness.
O n paper there are several good team s in
the NBA, but none stepped up to the next
level.
G olden State has always seem ed to have all
of the potential in the world, but th at’s all it is,
potential. D raft picks that didn’t come through
and coaching that didn’t work.
T he list goes on,, from P hiladelphia to
M innesota to Dallas, but the bottom line is that
basketball in the NBA is killing itself.
Players are coming in too young. Kevin
G arnett is the needle in the haystack when it

The high school students this year who are
trying to follow in G a rn e tt’s footsteps are
going to find it is not easy scoring against the
Pippens and R odm ans of the league.
G arn ett has one advantage; he is a big,
athletic guy who can handle the ball very well.
The guys coming in are all around 6-6 and 6-7.

Going up against a Karl Malone or a Shawn
Kemp might burst their dream s very quickly.
But all these young players in the NBA
think they are the best thing that happened to
the league. Then people like Jordan come in
and put them in their place.
If anybody can ask what is the best thing
that has happened to the league, it is Jordan.
W hen he went on his year and a half hiatus, the
N B A fell sharply. P eople like Shaquille
O ’Neal, Penny Hardaw ay and Scottie Pippen
couldn't keep up the excitem ent. Nobody
cared. I ’m going to say it bluntly. Jordan is the
NBA.
Jordan’s Chicago team is one of the oldest
teams in the league and they are the most
successful team in history.
In a league that has turned to youthfulness
instead of experience, it is funny that the team
that has the most experience seems to have the
m ost talent.
A player coming into the league before he is
ready can be harmful to his head. A nd the
NBA does nothing to discourage these people.
The NBA loves the attention and in the long
run it might just backfire on them when they
don’t have anybody like a Jordan to fall back
on.
This might just be a personal thing but the
NBA team s really needs to find a new stylist.
Have you seen the courts like in Toronto and
H ouston? The Graphics in these arena’s are
just plain nasty. W hat happened to the simple
days with a plain hard wood floor with the
team s mascot in the middle?
A little side note to the team s” changing
uniform styles. W hen the Chicago Cubs won
back-to-back World Series in 1907 and 1908
they changed their uniforms and haven’t won
since. It also happened to the New York Giants
in 1922 and the Philadelphia A s in 1930.
