Hays and her classmates also had
several physical training sessions
per week.
Hays said the most valuable
thing
she
experienced
at
Quantico was the interaction with
other law enforcement agencies.
There were 264 students int her
class; she was among 14 women
in the group. Hays maintained
that the training was fair to all of
the members of the class.
At the end of the 11-week
session Hays and her classmates
experienced the Yellow Brick

the
6.25-m ile-long
endurance and obstacle course at
Quantico. Hays and eight of her
classmates ran it together. No
record had to be set. There was
no time constraint. They just had
to finish. Upon completion of the
course, each person received a
yellow-painted brick. H ays’ is

“ It was truly a unique
experience,” Hays said. “I wasn’t

40s. It was something I definitely
wanted to do. It was a personal
challenge and it was fun.”

International night will be in the
Meridian Ballroom and will
feature an international buffet
and performances celebrating the
cultures of different lands.
Food of Indian, Pakistani,
Spanish, French, African, Korean
and Colombian origin will be
featured. Doors open at 6 p.m.
with dinner starting at 6:30 p.m.,
followed by the different cultural
performances.
“We are expecting about 400
people to attend the function on
Saturday,”
said
Kiran
Raghavapudi, president of the
International Student Council.

Tickets for the event can be
bought at Union Station and cost
$4 for students and $8 for others.
“ 1 think the event is very
important. This is an event which
brings forward all the cultures
together and that will make the
international students feel at
home at SIU E,” Raghavapudi
said. “I think the event is well
received. SIUE does have a lot of
international students compared
to
other
schools.
The
international community is very
active in almost all the school
events.”
Karthik Nagappan, a native
of India who is attending SIUE
for his m aster’s degree in
electrical engineering, said SIUE
does have a relatively large
population of foreign students
with the Indian culture being the
most prevalent.

ARTS REPORTER
“Wood, Fire, Clay” is the
current exhibition featured in the
New Wagner Gallery in the Art
and Design Building. The
collection is a personal endeavor
of Professor Dan Anderson,
head of ceramics at SIUE.
For almost • 30 years,
Anderson has been a huge part
of the phenomenal success of
the ceramics program offered at
SIUE. Each work chosen by
Anderson
represents
advancements that ceram ics
have made in the field of art.
The exhibit can be seen
from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Monday through Friday and
noon to 3 p.m. on Saturday
through Nov. 19.
Often considered a simple
craft, ceram ics is an intense
creation of form
through
manipulation of soft clay.

Nagappan went on to say
that SIUE has earned a very good
reputation with the international
students. “Every office has
been
very
cooperative,”

The ceramists featured in the
exhibit use wood kilns as a firing
method and the results are often
grainy, textured, earth-toned and
imperfectly shaped. Bottles, jars,
barrels, vases and plates are
among the many functional items
created. Closed forms and anvils
exist to suggest purposes beyond
functionality o f ceramic art.

On Nov. 8 at 11:40 p.m., a student reported that sometime between
9 p.m. on Nov. 6 and 11 p.m. on Nov. 8 someone damaged the
antenna on her car parked in Lot 4. There are no suspects or
witnesses.

Traffic accident
On Nov. 5 at 11:20 p.m ., police investigated a traffic accident with
injuries on South University Drive. A car driven by Howard Liner,
18, of Collinsville w as driving north on University Drive when he
lost control of his car and ran into a ditch. Liner was arrested for
failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident, leaving the scene of an
injury accident, driving under the influence and operating an
uninsured motor vehicle. Liner could not post bond and was taken
to the Madison County Jail. A female passenger sustained injuries
and was taken by ambulance to Anderson Hospital.

Deer struck
On Nov. 9 at 4:40 p.m., Marita Strube of Belleville reported she

Nagappan said.
“If we came for a bachelor’s
degree we would have more time
to mix with the American kids,”
Nagappan
said.
“ In
our
homelands we can get a
bachelor’s degree but we can’t
specialize. So we come here [to

America] to get a m aster’s
degree.”
He went on to say that events
like International Week are a
positive influence for all students
on campus. “ We are learning
about your country and we are
teaching you about our culture.”

The list of artists represented
in this exhibition includes such
notable ceramic names as Paul
Voulkos, Toshiko Takeauzu, Don
Reitz and Bob Archambeau.
Jeff Shapiro, another of the
featured artists, has contributed a
jar form containing an interesting

composition. Shapiro lived in
Japan for more than 10 years and"
has been influenced by the

Bizenware ceram ics of that
region.
Shapiro will be conducting

on Tuesday and Wednesday,
followed by slide shows both
days from 1 to 2 p.m. in the Art

apply for Quantico. Hays waited
for two years before being
accepted and postponed it until
this summer for personal and
professional reasons.
“The training academy is
the upper echelon,” said Hays.
“It is by far the best experience
I’ve had in law enforcement. It is
a definite experience to network
with the FBI and other agencies.
The message is that, in order to
be effective, law enforcement

agencies must work together.”
The FBI National Academy
is usually open only to officers
holding the rank o f lieutenant or
higher, but individual exceptions
are occasionally allowed. Once
accepted, the applicant usually
waits two to four years to attend
Quantico. Since 1935, 194
sessions
have
been
held,
producing m ore than 31,000
graduates from 123 different

During the past w eeks,
Honduras, my native country, has
suffered the most devastating and
terrible tragedies. There has
never been
anything
like
Hurricane Mitch in Honduran
history. In less than 72 hours,
Mitch took complete cities and
thousands o f peoples’ lives with
him.
As of this writing, more than
7.000 H ondurans have died,
6.000 have disappeared and
almost 6,000 have been placed in
shelters around the country.
Mitch caused general destruction
to the Honduran territory.
Bridges, buildings, houses
and fields with crops were
literally wiped out by incessant
storms, mudslides, unstoppable
winds and floods. The level of
the water was as high as a threestory house.
“Nightmare” would not be
the right word to describe what
my people are going through. All
over the country, people are
going
w ithout
electricity,
telephone communications, safe
water,
food,
clothes
and
m edicine.
There
is
no

com munication
among
the
different cities in the country, and
rescue teams are doubling their
efforts to help those who need the
most. Seventy percent o f the
agricultural production has been
lost, and there are areas that have
been deleted off the map and
communities that do not exist
anymore.
Survivors can still be seen
standing on houses’ roofs waiting
to be rescued. Some, after days
with nothing to eat, eat leaves to
mitigate their hunger until help
arrives.
It is inexplicable what my
husband and I feel for our
families and people in Honduras.
To know that the country we
were born in is 60 percent
smashed touches us so deeply, to
the point that sleep is not
necessary when fam ilies and
friends are in danger and the
hope of hearing from them is
almost impossible.
We really want to thank all
those people (friends, classmates
and professors) w ho have
inquired about our families and
shown concern for Honduras. We

Androgenous apathy?
While talking with some of
my friends about the Marilyn
Manson concert and the Aiestle
column that covered it, I came up
with an analogy of what it was
like for Marilyn Manson to play
at the Fox Theatre. To get the
proper effect, you would need to
begin with a w onderfully
appointed dining room lit with
soft candlelight. Then you would
take your best crystal and china
and set the table with exacting
precision. Then to begin the
meal, you would violently vomit
onto each place setting. O f
course, the effect would be much
enhanced if you got someone

A i e s t l e

who was sick with the flu to do
the serving. And if it were the
stomach flu, you might get the
added bonus of diarrhea. Then it
could be sort of a weird dinner
theater/performance art kind of
thing. Reviewing such an event
would be like picking through the
pieces of slime of it all.
O f course, people do have
the right to serve predigested
cuisine and hold concerts
w herever they like and the
Aiestle should cover them if they
want. Also, I realize that my
analogy will likely not affect
anyone but those who are already
convinced; it is futile to shock the
depraved with depravity. They
will only laugh in your face. But
still that doesn’t mean that one

simply lament our collective

Mainstream sado-masochism
Every night around 8 p.m., my parents watch
Geraldo Rivera’s CNBC show “Rivera Live” to yell at
the screen. For about an hour, Rivera gives his skewed
perception o f the world under the guise that he is an
unbiased journalist. Names of defendants are read with a
Danielle feeling of disgust and a furrowing of brows. Rivera utters
Belton President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky’s names
with venom.
If Rivera is making any attempt to seek out the truth and give the
American public a better understanding of the issues at hand, he, like
many other journalists, is failing miserably. Bitterly cynical, Rivera
and many news networks today seem to have made up their minds
about our public figures. T hey’ve decided they are all corrupt, lying
philanderers, and if any news tries to tell otherwise, it’s not treated
as news. The trend in journalism appears to be changing from
cautious skepticism to bitter cynicism. And the trend is turning off
Americans.
Many critics and journalists alike have contended that until
President Richard Nixon and Watergate the media had covered the
White House and politics with a respectful, yet skeptical reserve.
Politicians cheated on their wives as much as they do now, but the
media felt no need to venture into the tawdry details of our public
officials’ sexual habits. Then Watergate, the mother of all news
stories, broke and journalism hasn’t been the same since. Every
political person is now a suspect, every president a potential sinner
waiting to be exposed.
Unfortunately, a scandal as hard-hitting as Watergate hasn’t
exposed itself so far, but it hasn’t been for the journalists’ lack of
trying. Since then, the media have been on an endless search for
another Watergate to the point that they often dub lesser White House
scandals with the suffix “ -gate.” Since the 1960s, w e’ve had IranContragate, White Watergate, Filegate, Travelgate and Monicagate.
This only shows how media cynicism has worsened, instead of
a crop of hard-hitting, wiry, skeptical journalists in the field, we have
a gaggle o f cynical locusts desecrating the field before they destroy
it.
Clinton was a marked man before George Bush’s seat even got
cold. Denied the usual honeymoon period for presidents, he set the
precedent for our public officials’ getting pounced upon from day
one. Four of the five new so-called “-gates” named above are Clinton
White House scandals. If the current trashing Clinton is receiving is
a portent of what is to come in the future, what is going to happen to
a nation that watches this daily dose o f Clinton carnage every night?
Journalists don’t want to appear soft when handling a public
official, but with their urge to tear down public figures before our
representatives get a chance to try, they are ruining their own
reputations with the public. Many Americans dislike the media as
much as they dislike the politicians whom the media expose. Many
people have become apathetic toward both groups, resulting in the
low voter turnouts we see today. People don’t want to be associated
with so much cynicism and negativity. Potential voters turn off their
sets in disgust as they watch the media attack the politicians, then
watch the politicians manipulate the media to dismember each other.
Every day the cynicism grows and grows, and with C linton’s
impeachment proceedings dangling above our heads, it seem s the
cynicism m achine shows no sign o f stopping anytim e soon.
Therefore, public distrust will continue as the media go from being
the voice of the people to the voice o f themselves. Instead of being
the people’s advocates or watchdogs, today’s news media are quickly
turning into a group of sado-masochists who get their pleasures from
the destruction of others.

Not everyone graduates
high school and goes straight
to college.
Imagine what it would be
like to work, cook, clean, bathe
kids, maintain a relationship with
a spouse and then read two
chapters from your physics text,
write a tw o-page paper for
English and pray to God that you
get more than four hours of sleep
that night.
This is an example of a day
in the life of a nontraditional
student.
Nontraditional students are
students who have other full-time
responsibilities besides school.
These students are men and
women who are often older than
traditional
students,
have
children, are married and/or work
full time outside of school.
Kirsteen
Laidlaw is a
nontraditional student pursuing
her m aster’s in social work.
Laidlaw
is
assisting
in
developing
a
survey
of
nontraditional students that is
intended to aid in improving
services. With the help of
Christa Oxford, assistant vice
■chancellor,
Enrollment
Management and Registrar, she
will be m ailing out a needs

assessment survey/questionnaire
to all graduate and undergraduate
students who are over a certain
age and qualify as nontraditional
students. The graduate students’
surveys will be mailed out next
w eek, and the surveys for
undergraduates will be mailed
out two w eeks after that. All
students should receive the
surveys by Thanksgiving.
“The purpose of the survey is
for the university to find out how
we can improve the services we
provide
for
nontraditional
students. It is harder to receive
information from nontraditional
students because they have other
com m itm ents
and time is
limited,” Oxford said.
“ M ost academ ic systems
are set up for traditional students.
We want to see if the system
that is set up is actually
helping or hindering the success
of nontraditional students, and if
it is hindering, how we can
improve the system to where
it
becom es
beneficial,”
Laidlaw said.
Oxford and Laidlaw believe
the survey is the most effective
way to begin changing campus
life and m aking it easier for
nontraditional students. It is very
important that all students who
receive the survey complete and
return it in a timely manner.

A call for all

You know w hat’s the matter
with the world today? Too much
to mention actually, but I’ll note
one thing in particular: People
don’t express their opinions and
feelings like they should. T hat’s
what I’m here for. My name is
Sheri McWhirter and I was hired
as Lifestyle editor in midOctober. I’m a sophom ore in
mass communications as well as
the resident assistant on 1 North
in Woodland Hall.
Well, being that this is the
section dedicated to lifestyles,
I’ll briefly describe w hat that
typically means. The usual
suspects when it com es to
lifestyles are fashion trends,
music, movies and books. T hat’s
why you see a lot o f reviews on
these pages. But I’m starting to
think there should be more.
I want to cover issues in the
Lifestyle section that aren’t the
usual suspects. Granted, fashion
trends, music, movies and books
are all important entities to
lifestyles. But isn’t there more? Can
anybody really understand the
spectrum of lifestyles on this
campus viewed only through those
topics? Of course not. And
personally, I like reading about
things other than the usual suspects.
Don’t you? Or is The Alestle the
only outlet of information that you
cherish enough to read? I certainly
hope not.

So here’s the deal: If you email me at sm cw hir@ siue.edu
and tell me what you want to
read about in the Lifestyle pages,
I’ll put it there. Promise. OK, I’ll
really try. Also, tell me what you
don’t like. Tell me what you do
like. Just tell me. Do you like
what I’ve done with the page
since Corey Stulce stepped down
as Lifestyle editor? I need some
feedback.
Hey, by the way, want a
job?
I need people interested in
any aspect of any kind of
lifestyle (that means everybody)
who has good writing skills (not
everybody) and is self-motivated
(definitely not everybody). If
you fit the bill, get an
employment referral from
the Office of Student
Employment and drop by The
Alestle in Room 2022 in
University Center.

ALESTLE STAFF
REPORT
After eight months of
recording at Mr. Sm all’s
Funhouse in their hometown
of Pittsburgh, Rusted Root
has successfully created an
organic sounding record true
to their nature. The result is
the band’s self-titled album
which is the third album with
recording label Mercury.
This new music displays
Rusted Root’s expanded
instrumentation and is a
potent mixture of Latin,
African, Eastern, soul, rock,
and traditional American
music.
With the assistance of
producer Susan Rogers
(Barenaked Ladies, Prince),
Rusted Root has woven these
influences together to create
a focused, energetic and
exciting new collection of
songs that is without
question their m ast inspired
album to date.
Rusted Root’s 12 tracks
include the exuberant
“Magenta Radio,” “ Rising
Sun” and “Live A Long
Time.” The new album also
includes Root’s version of
the Rolling Stones’ classic
“You Can’t Always Get
What You Want” performed

C o m ic s

h e a v e n

RUSTED ROOT
with special guests Hot Tuna,
who shared support duties on the
1998 Furthur Festival.
Rusted Root has established
itself as a major touring entity,
headlining venues all across
America and Canada. In
addition, they’ve been fortunate
enough to tour with some o f the
most legendary icons in rock
music such as The Grateful
Dead, Page and Plant, Santana,
The Allman Brothers Band, Sting
and The Dave M atthews Band.
Rusted Root is dedicated to a
myriad of environmental and
social causes. They regularly

invite groups such as
Greenpeace, The Rainforest
Action Network and Planned
Parenthood to distribute
information at their shows. This
past fait, Rusted Root set up a
food drive program at their
shows which benefited local
food banks in each city they
performed in, including the 1998
Furthur Festival at Riverport
Amphitheatre.
Rusted Root will hit the
road headlining dates throughout
the fall and into 1999, in support
of their new release.

Disappointing season
derives from injuries
and inexperience
BY BRETT LICATA
SPO R T S W R IT E R
In ju rie s a n d in e x p e rie n c e m ad e th e 1998 seaso n a
disappointing one fo r the S IU E m en ’s soccer team .
H ead coach E d H u n ek e d id n ’t plan on having to play as
m any freshm en as he did, b u t a season filled w ith b a d luck had a
num ber o f his experienced players fall o u t o f th e lineup because
of season-ending injuries.
“ W hen you lose four key players to seaso n -en d in g injuries, it
m akes it difficult,” H u n ek e said. “ B ut I w as im pressed by the
am ount o f passion this team played with d esp ite the hardships
we faced.”
T he C ougars finished the season with a 7-11-1 record overall
and a 5-6 m ark in the G re a t L akes Valley C onference.
A fte r a slow start to the season w here S IU E w on only one of
its first six gam es, th e C ougars seem ed to be o n a roll late in the
year, w inning th ree o f th e ir last four.
“ I’m pleased with the im provem ent we show ed as the year
w ent on,” H u n ek e said. “Tow ard the en d o f th e year, we w ere
really clicking.”
A h e a rtb re ak in g gam e against Q uincy U niversity in the
conference to u rn a m e n t last w eek en d e d th e season for S IU E .
T he C ougars m anaged to tie th e No. 2 team in the conference 22 as M att L ittle scored his 12th and 13th goals o f th e year. B ut
Q uincy m oved on to the second round w ith a win in th e shootout
to stifle S IU E ’s chance of an upset.
“This was a trem en d o u s soccer gam e. It w as very hard-fought
. and em o tio n al,” H u n e k e said. “ N e ith er team d eserv ed to lose, but
in this situ atio n , we n e ed e d a w inner.”
O n e of th e characteristics o f the C ougars th a t h u rt them this
y ear was th e ir inability to win one-goal gam es. S IU E had eight
one-goal contests go in favor o f its opponents.
L ittle led th e C ougars in scoring this season with 13 goals and
four assists fo r a to tal of 30 points. H e en d s his c a re e r at S IU E
with 26 goals an d 15 assists. L ittle plans to m ove on to the
professional level in the n ear future.
“ H e ’s highly respected by players, coaches an d fans,” H uneke
said. “ I’d say h e ’s o n e o f th e b est players th a t I ’ve e v er coached.”
Todd H u n te r en d s his S IU E c aree r a fte r an injury-filled four
years with the program . H u n te r was second on th e team in
scoring with six goals and four assists for 16 points.
“ W hat T odd lacks in physique, he m akes u p for in skill and
sm arts,” H u n e k e said.
Kividi K ikam a is a defensive an ch o r th a t H u n e k e will lose
next year.
“ I’ve b een im pressed with him for th e last two years,”
H uneke said. “Kividi is so good on the ball.”
H u n ek e will also lose talen te d d efen d ers Jeff Stevens and
D oug H a rtm a n n to g raduation.
“T hey a re b o th h ard -w o rk in g a n d ag g ressiv e p layers,”
H uneke said. “Jeff and D oug a re excellent m ark in g backs.”
C had R ichardson will tak e over in goal as C hris K oenig ends
his stay a t S IU E .
“ C hris did a g re at jo b for us,” H u n ek e said. “ I’m confident
th at C had can ste p up next year. H e got b e tte r and b e tte r as the
year w ent on.”
O ne o f the positive things th at cam e o u t o f this season was
th at m any o f the young players gained valu ab le gam e experience
by filling in for the injured starters.
“ It’s fo rtu n a te fo r the freshm an class to g e t th e experience
they did,” H u n e k e said.
