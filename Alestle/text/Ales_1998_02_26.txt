SEAC circulates
petition against
amphiteater
■ BY AMANDA
BARTON
NEWS STRINGER
As the debated continues on
whether or not an amphitheater
should be built off Bluff and Poag
Roads, some SIUE students have
become very involved in fighting
the proposal.
The SIUE chapter of Student
Environmental Action Coalition
(SEAC) has begun to gather
petitions against the amphitheater
proposal.
SEAC is part of a national
organization and was formed in
1991. It is a group whose
objective is to inform and educate
students
and
staff
about
environmental issues.
The SEAC President Will
Broadway, a sophmore and
English major, said their
organization is against the
building of the amphitheater
because they fear it will be a
detriment to the enviroment. He
and other SEAC members are
concerned with the threat of noise
pollution, litter and disturbing the
wildlife that resides on the site
area.
Broadway became involved
in SEAC during his freshman
year when he saw a flier and went
to a meeting.
“I’ve been a part of SEAC
ever since the first meeting I
attended,” Broadway said.
SEAC Treasurer
Kelly
Victory said she is against the
amphitheater for two reasons.
She feels the proposal is
incomprehensive and that if the
Edwardsville City Council votes
on the current proposal they will
be rushing into a decision
uninformed.
“I don’t feel as if there has
been any consideration as to what
the amphitheater will do to the
environment,” Victory said.
Victory, senior majoring in
biology, said she became
involved in SEAC more than two
years ago. She became interested

in the environment and wanted to
become a part of an organization
with similar views. Victory is
also concerned with not only the
amphitheater but any other
proposals for that area.
“Since they are considering
annexing that area, I wonder what
will happen long term,” Victory
said.
Broadway, who stands in the
doorways in the University
Center getting petitions signed
said,
“We
have
gotten
approximately 700 signatures so
far.”
However, Broadway also
said they need more than a
thousand signatures to make a
real impact.
SEAC’s main goal in having
the petitions signed is to let the
City Council know that many
students and staff at SIUE are
against
the
amphitheater
proposal.
SEAC members are in the
University Center every weekday
for more than three hours having
petitions
signed.
Although
Broadway feels there may be
some good aspects to having an
amphitheater he looks at whether
the money that can be made will
justify the costs to the
environment.
The SEAC organization is
working in cooperation with
Neighbors for Amphitheter
Awareness,
a
group
of
Edwardsville Township residents
who are also very strongly
opposed to the proposal.
John Quinn, a member of
NAA, urges residents through a
flier to telephone their local
representatives and ask them
pertinent questions about the
amphitheater proposal.
The
NAA focuses on issues of crime
and violence, traffic, noise and
city goals in regard to the
amphitherater proposal.
Brodway said he attends the
NAA meetings on a regular basis.
However, neither Broadway or
Victory have attended a City
Council meeting

A student receives help in th Writing Center, one of the most used tutoring
service services at SIUE. Last semester 1,557 students used the Writing Center.

SIUE makes tutoring services available for
students in different academic departments
■ BY ZHANDA

College
students
may
sometimes find themselves
struggling with their classes or
may just want to remain on
track. SIUE has tutoring services
available so students receive the
help they need.
Besides traditional tutoring
services, SIUE offers a variety of
different tutoring styles in
different academic departments.
This spring SIUE is offering
supplemental instruction, as well
as,
informal
conversation
sessions and facilities such as the
Writing Center and Math
Resource Area. These tutoring
services can help students with
homework, prepare them for
tests and proofread and give
suggestions on papers.
One of the most used tutoring
services at SIUE is the Writing
Center.
“Last semester a total of
1,557 students came to the
Writing Center for assistance,”
said Jeanette Hanley, supervisor
of the Writing Center.
Hanley said that one benefit
of the Writing Center is that it

gives students feedback on their
work before they turn it in.
One student who has taken
advantage of the writing Center
is Senior Michael Hill.
“I have been to the Writing
Center a couple of times,” Hill
said. “Most of the time I found
it helpful.”
Another area which provides
students with tutoring is Special
Services. Students who are part
of Special Services can set up a
specific tutoring day and time
for any subject. There are tutors
available in subjects ranging
from critical
thinking to
chemistry.
Richard Bamfo, a sophmore,
said Special Services really
helped him with chemistry class.
Bamfo said that because of
the tutoring he received he began
to do a lot better in class.
“I was really struggling with
Chemistry 151,” Bamfo said.
“Tutoring
helped
me
tremendously.”
Not
all
students
take
advantage of the available
tutoring services. Retannical
Russel, a senior, said she never
used any tutoring services
because she has always gotten
help from her professors.
“I have never had the need to

go get tutoring,” Russel said. “I
have
always
found
my
professors to be helpful when
there was something that I did
not understand or needed help
with.”
Tutoring assistance is also
available for specific courses.
Tutoring for accounting courses
is available Monday though
Friday in the Accounting
Department Conference Room,
tutoring for chemistry courses is
available Monday, Wednesday
and Thursday. Other courses
include
computer
science
(specifically CS108 and 140)
and economics (specifically
Econ 111 and 112). Assistance is
also available for academic
development courses.
A list of tutoring assistance
available this spring can be
found in the Writing Center
located in the Peck Hall, room
1419 and in the Math Resource
Center located in the Peck
Building, room 1414. For other
tutoring services that are not
listed above, contact Karen Patty
Graham, director of the office of
Instructional Services, at 6923717 in Peck Hall, room 1404.
Patty Graham can also be
e-mailed at kpattyg@siue.edu.

Jury awards $6 million to family of Waukegan hate crime victim
WAUKEGAN, 111. (AP) —
A Lake County jury has awarded
$6 million to the family of a
teen-ager who was kicked and
subjected to racial slurs as he lay
dying after a car crash.
The jury’s decision Monday
is
the
largest
hate-crime
judgment in Illinois history, said
a lawyer involved in the case.
The jury found that David
Killian, a 32-year-old Waukegan
construction worker, was liable

for attacking 15-year-old Ricardo
Arroyo after a traffic accident in
February 1996.
The car Killian was riding in
broadsided Arroyo’s, and Killian
was angry that his car had been
damaged, police said.
He approached Arroyo, who
lay bleeding on the ground,
kicked him three times in the
stomach and shouted, “Mexicans,
go back to Mexico!” police said.
Arroyo, also of Waukegan,

died from injuries received in the
crash.
Killian was convicted in July
1996 of a hate crime and
aggravated battery. He was
sentenced to three years’
probation and a year in a workrelease program. He was not in
court Monday, nor did he have a
lawyer there.
“The jury sent a message
that this is intolerable conduct
that can’t be condoiied in a

civilized society, and that there’s
a high price to pay when
someone commits a hate crime,”
said attorney Betsy ShumanMoore, director of the Hate
Crime Project for the Chicago
Lawyers Committee for Civil
Rights.
Shuman-Moore,
who
worked on the case, said the
judgment far exceeds the
previous highest in state history
— $1.8 million awarded to a

Chicago woman in 1991 whose
neighbor had made anti-Semitic
remarks.
Antonio Arroyo, father of the
Waukegan victim, said the family
doesn’t expect to see any of the
money, but hopes the judgment
sends a strong message against
hate crimes.
“Acting like this is totally
wrong,” he said. “We are
humans. Nobody deserves to die
that way.”

Whatever happened to the UWSA and
the Ross Perot phenomenon of 1992?

o f “perfection ”fro m Disney.
It is second
nature for people
to complain no
matter what their
situation.
A
person could be
rich or a person
Danielle could be poor
and they could
Belton
both claim to
have the same problems.
People complain about the
campus and they complain
about the school, yet oddly
enough, despite all this anger
and fury, the only person that
appears to be sending me letters
for the editorial page is myself.
Occasionally, someone like
Lee Presser, featured here on
this page, will send me an
editorial to fill my space and
I’m thankful, yet I still crave the
gritty wit and opinions of the
campus community.
I couldn’t help but be a
little disappointed this month in
particular. No one sent in an
editorial
to this
section
pertaining to Black History or
African-American’s on this
campus, nor anything related to
civil rights and diversity.
It seems that unless we
make a large gross error, we
don’t hear a peep out of anyone.
And as much as I love to see
myself in the paper every week,
I wouldn’t mind letting the
column take a back seat to some
real on-campus input.
So I suppose what I’m
asking for is your opinion. I
hear you complain about at least
one thing concering this campus
everyday, but you can’t seem to
write about it in 500 words or
less. I’m starting to believe this
must be the most perfect school
in the world, because if my only
source of information about this
campus was the editorial page,
I’d think SIUE was claiming
Disneyland’s title as the
happiest place on earth.

Danielle Belton
Editor In Chief

In 1992, a wealthy man named Ross
Perot spoke his mind and within a short
period had captured the imagination of
millions of Americans. He laid out a
challenge to the citizens of all 50 states,
•saying that if the citizens did what was
necessary to put his name on all state ballots,
he would spend enough money to run a world
class presidential campaign.
To his surprise, citizens took up the
challenge. In mid-July, Mr. Perot was well on
his way to qualifying as an independent
presidential candidate on all 50 state ballots.
Without warning he shocked his volunteers
by suspending his campaign. The volunteers
would not accept the suspension. They kept
gathering signatures and organizing for the
campaign. In October, Mr. Perot returned to
the field, resuming candidacy, and in
November received millions of votes
equaling 19 percent of the national total. In
some states his votes totaled more than 25
percent of the votes cast. He won no states
and because of the winner-take-all rules, he
did not win one Electoral College vote.
Despite the loss, Perot supporters were
energized and ready to continue the battle for
a properly organized government. The
volunteers talked about starting a third party.
Instead, in January 1993, Mr. Perot founded
United We Stand America (UWSA). This was
an interim organization designed to create the
necessary infrastructure for a viable third
party. Perot’s supporters remembered the
chaos that occurred in 1992 when in a short
period thousands of people wanted to
volunteer. UWSA was that interim step
necessary to create political contacts
throughout the state. When the Reform Party
was developed for the 1996 campaign, there
were throughout all states political contact
points ready to plug volunteers into a variety
of important activities.
In 1996, the Reform Party did not
experience the same overwhelming support
that had been experienced during the 1992
campaign. Commentators explained this in
several ways. The first explanation was that
Ross Perot was a phenomenon of 1992
political and economic conditions. They said
that those conditions had changed and the
nation did not feel the need for a third party.
Another reason given was disappointment
with Ross Perot’s July 1992 suspension. It is
said that many people felt betrayed by the
lame excuse offered for the suspension. Some
have speculated that Ross Perot thought he

may actually win the Presidency in 1992 and
changed his strategy. Therefore, since he
really did not want to be president in 1992,
why “throw away your vote” by voting
reform in 1996? Yet, there were enough
Reform Party votes cast in 1996 to ensure the
party a spot on many state ballots in 1998 as
an established party. If they receive enough
state votes in 1998, the party will
automatically have their presidential
candidate on the state ballots in 2000.
One unspoken reason for reduced
support in 1996 may have been press reports
of internal dissent within the Perot reform
movement. The story goes like this, during
the 1992 campaign there was a myth created
that the volunteers were promoting Perot’s
candidacy. Yet, within the movement there
were dissidents arguing that “Dallas” was
controlling everything. “Dallas” would not
provide lists of people who called the 800
number to volunteer. “Dallas” was not well
organized. “Dallas” was not providing the
money necessary to operate effective local
campaigns. The press loved the controversy,
promoting it with repeated stories. After the
election and before the Reform Party was
launched, press accounts of the complaints
continued. There were reports that dissident
volunteers quit and others split off from the
main movement. When the Reform Party was
established, it was again reported that small
groups of dissidents were seeking to control
state and local organizations.
Ross perot has removed himself from
day-to-day operations of the party. “Dallas”
has been reduced to a ‘virtual’ office. The
word has gone out that the party must
organize itself in each state. That means
competing with the Democrats and
Republicans for voters, slates of local
candidates and of course, money.
The party is looking for an identity
beyond the Ross Perot persona. They must
learn to articulate a set of principles which the
voters will reorganize as a realistic alternative
to reelecting either a Democrat of
Republican. They must speak in simple
language, explaining why a district would be
better off electing a Reform candidate. They
must use word pictures that are clearly
understandable to show how life will be better
if the Reform Party controlled the legislature
of the city council. Without that identity,
without those word pictures, the public will
shrug off the Reform Party as just
another group of political fanatics

seeking to play at politics.
Is the Reform Party organizing for the
purpose of electing candidates and then
operating the levers of power or is the party a
protest to the current state of politics found in
the two major parties?
Party theorists believe they are not very
far from having some effective control at the
national
level.
In
the
House
of
Representatives, Newt Gingrich has an eleven
vote majority. These theorists believe that if
they could win one or two dozen of the
correct House seats, they would be in position
to negotiate who will be the next Speaker of
the House. That would mean that the Reform
Party would be in a position to have an effect
on the Congressional calendar and to help set
national legislative priorities.
These are heady thoughts for a group of
non-political professionals and former
housewives. They hope to be taken seriously
once they control the swing votes in
Congress. The idea that their party could have
such an influence on American politics was
far out of proportion to their actual political
support. They point to Israel as an example of
a government where a couple of small
religious parties could bring’ down the
government by removing their support. Of
course, that is a poor example since Israel has
a parliamentary form of government and
America does not. American governments do
not fall, they become gridlocked.
The Reform Party is still a growing
movement. Like the Republican Party of the
1850s, the Reform Party hopes to become one
of the two major political parties. They do not
seek to gridlock America. They attract new
affiliations with both independent voters and
disaffected Democrats and Republicans. They
are growing fast in the nation’s inner cities.
The Black Caucus is beginning to show an
interest as the Democrats lose their hold on
the black vote. They are working hard to
address issues important to working people,
Hispanics, entrepreneurs, young people,
pensioners, union members, etc. Every group
is a target of this aggressive new political
force.
Democrats and Republicans had better
stay flexible. There is a new party in town
hoping to earn your vote.

Opponents say abortion amendment may kill bill
CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP)
— A bill that would provide
health insurance to poor children
has been jeopardized by an
abortion dispute that arose
Tuesday in the House Finance
Committee.
A successful amendment by
Delegate Robert Pulliam, DRaleigh, would allow the
program to pay for abortions only
to save the life of the mother or if
the pregnancy was the result of
rape or incest. The measure
mirrors language in a federal law
that established the Children’s
Health Insurance Program.
Because the federal law
already contains the prohibition,
it was superfluous in the state
bill, said Delegate Margarette
Leach, D-Cabell, a main architect
of the House’s insurance plan

bill.
She and Delegate John Doyle,
D-Jefferson, said the prohibition
might lead pro-abortion delegates
to vote against the bill in the
House, where the finance
committee sent the bill after
discussing and amending it.
Leach said the House could
spend days debating the issue and
the bill (HB4299) might get
taken off the House agenda
because of it.
She complained that Pulliam
and Delegate Ron Walters, RKanawha, who had questioned a
dozen details of the bill and made
a
handful
of
his
own
amendments, were using the bill
to grandstand because they are
running for the state Senate.
“I think it’s very self-serving
of them,” Leach said.

“This is one of the most
important bills I have worked on
since I’ve been here,” she said.
Doyle said, “I think we
trivialize the issue of children’s
health by putting in an extraneous
issue like this ... I say very
strongly this is not the place to
settle this issue.”
Pulliam said he supports the
bill and would vote for it in the
House. Because the abortion
prohibition already is in federal
law, having it in the state bill
would do not harm, he said.
Putting the amendment in the
bill in committee would actually
avoid a fight over it in the House
because someone else would try
to do it at that stage, said Pulliam
and other anti-abortion delegates
who voted for the amendment.
“I also think we have to hold it

up to the public” as a statement,
Pulliam said.
The amendment passed 13-8
and the bill was sent to the House
on a voice vote.
Children’s lobbyist Amy
Tolliver said she hoped the
amendment could be deleted in
the House or in a conference
committee that likely will be
appointed to work out differences
between the House and Senate
bills. Tolliver is a lobbyist for the
Child Care Association and a
member the Coalition for West
Virginia Children.
Another lobbyist said the
abortion amendment is a minor
point.
"The major issue is can you
cover the maximum number of
children the state can afford?”
said Nidia Henderson, a lobbyist

Teen-ager sentenced to seven years for firebombing high school
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) —
The purported ring leader of a
group that firebombed a high
school was sentenced to seven
years in prison for the act that
caused more than $850,000
damage last summer.
Tony Stephenson, 19, was
sentenced Monday to five years
for second-degree arson and two

years for manufacturing an
explosive device. He was ordered
to
serve
the
sentences
consecutively, the Circuit Court
clerk’s office reported.
Stephenson, one of five young
people who admitted their
involvement in the June 24 arson
at Parkview High School, was the
ringleader, authorities said.

Prosecutors said the group
first threw Molotov cocktails into
the school. When they burned out
without causing much damage,
they drove to a gas station,
bought gasoline, poured it in a
hallway and set it ablaze.
The one who drove the group
to the station, Krystal Gladson,
remains to be sentenced. She

pleaded guilty Friday to seconddegree arson and faces up to three
years in prison.
Already sentenced were:
Stephenson’s brother, Nathan,
seven years in prison.
Timothy Dalan, 30 days shock
time in the county jail, a threeyear suspended prison sentence,
ordered to pay $10,000 in

restitution and serve 500 hours of
community service.
_ Rebecca Drew, 17, given a
suspended two-year sentence and
ordered to perform 250 hours of
community service.
Also, an unidentified girl in
her mid-teens was dealt with in
juvenile court.

federal poverty level sometime in
the fiscal year starting July 1. But
the House bill would cover older
children only up to 135 percent
of the poverty level in the first
year.
The poverty level varies
according to the number of
people in a family. For example,
for a family of four it is $ 16,056
a year, so the Senate bill would
provide coverage for children

whose family incomes were
$24,084 while the House bill
would cover families whose
incomes were slightly more than
$21,000 a year.
Henderson said the House
bill could mean some children
would have insurance until they
turn 7, then suddenly would be
without. Also, one child might
have insurance while an older
sibling would not.

Both bills would expand
Medicaid to include children
under 6 whose family incomes
are 150 percent of the poverty
level. That would cover about
1,700 children. There are about
40,000 uninsured children in
West Virginia.
The Senate bill (SB457)
would extend coverage to
children up to 19 whose family
incomes are 150 percent of the

Lunch hour pot party place raided near a
Michigan high school; police arrest family
BERKLEY, Mich. (AP) —
Police have raided a house near
Berkley High School in this
Detroit suburb where they say as
many as 30 students would gather
during lunch hour to buy and
smoke marijuana.
Eight officers raided the
house Feb. 11 following five
weeks of surveillance, The Daily
Tribune of Royal Oak reported
Wednesday. Police arrested the
homeowner, her two sons and
nine juveniles.

Detective Sgt. Raymond
Anger said as many as 30
students on any given day visited
a house during the school’s lunch
hour. The owner, 47, is mother of
a 15-year-old boy suspected of
selling marijuana at the home to
fellow students, Anger said. He
said she knew her son was
selling the drug.
All were released pending
issuance of warrants, Anger said.
Police on another day
videotaped up to 30 students

visiting the house during lunch,
he said.
Berkley Schools Personnel
Director George Blaney said the
raid comes as the school
considers tightening its opencampus rules.
“The open lunch task force
has recommended closing it to
ninth-graders starting the next
school year,” Blaney said. “There
were a few concerns expressed
that maybe the kids have too
much freedom.”

Corey Stulce/A/esi/e
The Aquabats performed a hyper-fun set at Mississippi Nights Tuesday night, while
Corey Stulce patiently waited for the interview he never got.

R M fS

By' Gorey sruLC£

First, let me clear a couple of
things up. First of all, I don’t
usually do a “Rants & Raves” on
Thursday, but I have been
compelled to by a large mix-up
that resulted in missing an
interview with the band “The
Aquabats.”
The second thing I need to
clear up is something that was
pointed out to me by a good
friend last week. The title of my
column is “Rants & Raves,” but
most of the time they are just
rants. Sure. I have a lot to
complain about, and not as much
to be happy about.
The question is, should I drop
the “Raves” part of “Rants &
Raves,” or just add more raves to
the section? I need input.
This spot should have been
occupied by a nice “ 13 Inane
Questions” interview with the
band The Aquabats. But, it’s not,
because someone screwed me

over.
I went to the illustrious kiddiehangout/club Mississippi Nights
Tuesday night. I was supposed to
be on the guest list and receive a
photo pass at the door. Guess
what! They weren’t there.
The band’s agent was nowhere
to be found, so the doorman
showed me the door. His job, I
guess.
Being
the
industrious
journalist that I am, I was able to
flag down one of the band
members leaving the tour bus. I
explained my problem, and he
promptly led me inside the club.
Problem averted, or so I
thought. I was supposed to do the
interview one hour after the
Aquabats were finished with their
set. By the way, they put on a
great show. The band, while
dressed in their matching
costumes, perform fast-paced,
quirky ska numbers while
bouncing and dancing all over the
stage. They are a good-time band.
I waited patiently after their
set to go backstage. After a
bouncer went and looked for their
manager, he returned and
informed me that the manager

had no idea they were suppose to
give an interview that night, but
to wait for him and he will come
and get me when the band was
ready.
He never came, at least not to
get me for the interview.
While I was waiting, I was
forced to stand on the floor (or
pit) of Mississippi Nights, while
hundreds of brainless pre-teens
bounced like happy little lapdogs to some no talent punk band
called Blink 182.
(Insert sarcastic tone here) No
offense to Blink 182 fans. Their
pointlessly loud and distorted
songs and pre-adolescent sex
jokes were just great! They will
go far.
By the way, Blink 182, you’re
about 14 minutes, 36 seconds
into your fame ride, prepare to
get off.
So, I went home with a roll of
film of the Aquabats and no story
to go with it. I cursed the
profession of publicists and
damned them all to hell.
Yesterday morning I called the
publicist who set the interview
up. He pretended to be surprised
by the situation, and said he
would call me back as soon as he
got to the bottom of things.
I’m still waiting for that call.
Today I get to call this joker
back and say, “Hey, what’s the
deal, pal?” And, if he’s rude and
doesn’t apologize 47 times, I get
to put his phone number in
Tuesday’s “Rants & Raves” for
my readers (all five of them) to
call him up.

Most of Adam Peck’s students
find
his
speech
classes
entertaining
without
truly
knowing why his teaching style is
so amusing.
One of his current students,
Quinten Siesmer, said, “I enjoy
his class because he is always
doing something interesting. He
makes
the
subject
of
interpersonal
communication
dynamic.” Peck brings life and
laughter to his classroom with his
extensive background in comedy.
He is an improvisational comic
and performs with a group of his
close friends at places like the
Fox Theater, area comedy clubs
and at SIUE.
When Peck was 17, he and a
friend auditioned for First Night,
an event held annually on New
Year’s Eve in St. Louis. They had
just begun performing together
and had no clue how much

money to expect. He and his
friend discussed how much they
would accept before going into a
meeting.
“At first, we decided we
would accept no less than $100,
then no less than $50,” Peck said.
“Then, we decided we would take
anything, even gas money.” He
was surprised when the duo was
offered $350 for their first real
performance.
The group Peck works and
performs improv-style comedy.
As part of their act, they perform
various routines including Peck’s
favorite called “Dumbing down
of American society.”
He performs with the group in
the area, but does not travel with
them in order to keep his teaching
career. “I don’t want to be
famous,” he said. “I do it because
I enjoy it. It is so much like
teaching, [that it is] fun. I feel like
‘Welcome Back Kotter.’”

Heavy metal/hip hop group
(hed)pe performs Saturday
■ BY SASHA MASTROIANNI
LIFESTYLE STRINGER

beat and melancholy lyrics set the song apart from
most.
Two themes that run through (hed) p.e.’s music
are overcoming obstacles and unification. God
forbid hard-core music having positive tones in it,
but one would never know without listening to the
lyrics.
Chances are, fans of Faith No More, RHCP, Snot or
even Anthrax will also like (hed) p.e. Their album is
good enough to give their live show a shot.
(hed) p.e. has toured with Sevendust, Coal
Chamber, Motley Crue and Suicidal Tendencies, so
an energy packed audience should be expected.
See (hed) p.e. perform with Stuck Mojo at the
Side Door Club this Saturday.

Rage Against the Machine does it, Korn does it,
and so do many other bands that go unknown in
clubs across the country. The combination of hard
rock/heavy metal and rap/hip-hop has become a
successful pairing in the last few years, even
making it to the airwaves in a few cases.
For the most part though, these bands have
weighed a little heavier on the rock than on the rap.
One emerging band, California’s (hed) p.e. has
taken the opposite angle and leaned to the rap side a
bit more.
They are currently on tour supporting their self­
titled second release.
“(hed) p.e.” the album, contains a
few tracks that are sure to gain them
attention.
Track number five, “Tired of
Sleep” is one relatively relaxed
song. As some of their tunes sound
more like rap in the vocals and some
in the music, this one leans toward
the vocals. It is among the best
songs on the album.
“Darky,” a song that starts with a
dark spooky tone, could have the
Beastie Boys on backing vocals and
Cypress Hill as a special musical
guest.
“Bitches,” another mellow, yet
funky ditty is a pleasant ending to an (hed) pe, a heavy metal/rap group performs Saturday
energy-packed album. The slow at the Side Door.

COMEDY
from page 8

“Teaching and comedy go hand in hand,” Peck
said. “Standup comedy and teaching are exactly the
same when done right.” He also said “funny things
stick” with his students, and sometimes they use his
exact musings on their test answers.
Peck’s students seem to appreciate his comedic
teaching style. “He is one of the most relaxed

teachers I have ever had,” Mike Dollar said. “He is
open-minded and humorous; it [his comedy] makes
the class.”
Peck and his improv group were pitching a
television show idea, which has been accepted by
the company Double Helix, who produces
syndicated shows in St. Louis, Kansas City and
Chicago. The show would most likely air in St.
Louis. Peck can also be seen from time to time at
the Comedy Etc. club in Fairview Heights.

New York City Mayor Giuliani gets angry at
Grammy big wig Michael Greene
NEW YORK (AP) — The
head of the Grammys said he was
sorry. But Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani wants Michael Greene to
sing a few more verses in his
apology for how he treated a city
employee.
On Tuesday, a day before the
awards ceremony at Radio City
Music Hall, Greene responded
only by tipping his hat to the
mayor, actually, a Yankees cap.
“I love the mayor, and I love
the city of New York,” was all the
president of the National
Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences would say on the matter
as he left a midtown news
conference about the Grammys.
The spat began last month
with
an
apparent
misunderstanding over whether
Giuliani would read a list of
Grammy nominees at a news
conference. When mayoral aide
Margot McGinness learned she
would not be needed, she asked
Greene for an explanation.

According
to
Giuliani's
spokeswoman,
Christyne
Lategano, what McGinness got
was a stream of obscenities.
Greene denies that. But
according to the mayor’s camp,
he offered only a “phony
apology.” Lategano says Greene
must still acknowledge “he
threatened the life of a city
worker and went on a profanitylaced tirade.”
Giuliani, who has been
insisting for a week on a fuller
apology, said Tuesday he wants
Greene to say: “It was wrong of
me to curse at her and I didn't
mean it that way. It’s not going to
happen again.”
It’s only the latest mini­
tempest for Giuliani, who has
made a name trying to make
residents of the unruly city
behave. He also said last month
that he would begin cracking
down on jaywalking.
Greene appeared at Tuesday’s
news conference with a star of

the Bad Boy Entertainment label,
Sean “Puffy” Combs. Along with
Stevie Wonder and Isaac Hayes,
they discussed how to persuade
young black music executives to
include inner-city musicians in
the Grammy voting process.
“What we’re struggling for is
respect,” Greene said.
He can’t count on it from the
mayor. Giuliani wasn’t planning
to attend the record industry’s
40th
annual
celebration
Wednesday night. Lategano said
he has a previous commitment: a
town hall meeting on Staten
Island.
Just two years ago, Giuliani
fought fiercely to win back the
Grammys ceremony, which
brings in tens of millions of
dollars in revenues from Los
Angeles. Now, he says he
wouldn’t mind losing the event to
another city.
The mayor, his spokeswoman
said, “sticks up for city workers.”

Cougars pounce over Panthers to advance to GLVC Semifinals
■ BY JASON
TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
One down and two to go until
the
NCAA
Division
II
tournament starts for the Cougar
women’s basketball team.
SIUE rolled over Kentucky
Wesleyan, 71-55, last night in the
quarter final round of the Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference
tournament where all but three
players contributed to the
Cougars’ scoring.
Throughout
the
season,
Cougar head coach Wendy
Hedberg has been confident this
year’s squad would be tough to
beat when they get to play their
style of game. The Cougar’s style
involves getting up and down the

court quickly and shooting for
three. This type of ball has been
too much for competitors. They
do a great job of kicking the ball
out and finding the open shooter.
“The idea was to take
[Wesleyan] out of their game
early,” Hedberg said. “We played
a full court man press to keep the
ball in our hands. They play a
zone to where the shots are
always there. We just needed to
keep the ball.”
Shooting seemed to be exactly
SIUE’s game plan and Wesleyan
never had a chance from the
opening tip at the Vadalabene
Center. An energetic 121 people
attended what seemed to be a
three point contest between
SIUE’s Misi Clark, Leslie
Phillips and Erica Cory. SIUE
shot 11 three pointers in the

game, six of which were made in
the first half.
If it was a contest, Clark won.
She hit three out of three shots
from the three-point arc and
totaled 22 points while Cory
contributed 10 points with 5
assists.
“We weren’t really nervous,
since we had beaten [Wesleyan]
before,” Clark said. “We picked
up the defense and jumped on
them early. We forced turnovers
and took the shot opportunities
they gave us.”
Wesleyan wasn’t completely
out of the game after the first
half. The Lady Panthers settled
themselves and attempted a
comeback by using some of
SIUE’s own tactics.
Junior Carrie Bridgeman, at
6’0, made her presence known in

the second half by banging and
rebounding her way to 14 points.
If the shot wasn’t there for
Bridgeman, usually the kick out
or ball reversal would leave
senior guard Misty Geary open
for one of her 4 three pointers in
her 22 point night.
Wesleyan’s attempt was too
little, too late. SIUE led 41-22 at
the start of the half and had shot
75 percent from the three-point
line. If the second half was a
different game, the outcome
would have been far different for
the Lady Panthers. Wesleyan shot
21 percent from the field in the
first half compared to 42 percent
in the second. The threes’ started
falling for them and they
gathered some composure on
offense, but the damage done by

SIUE was irreversible.
At tournament time anything
can and will happen. No. 2
seeded Lewis University lost, at
home, to No. 7 seeded St.
Joseph’s College last night.
Lewis, 15-3 in GLVC action, was
edged by St Joe’s 64-62 in what
is the first upset in the GLVC
tournament this year.
Now the Cougars will travel to
Southern Indiana’s campus in
Evansville, Ind. SIUE will face
St. Joseph’s Friday, who they
have beaten twice, instead of the
Lewis squad that had already
beaten SIUE once this season.
“We were looking forward to a
rematch with Lewis,” Hedberg
said. “But we match up better
with St Joe’s, which changes the
game plan slightly.”

Men’s hoops down Lewis to advance to second round of GLVC tourney
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Head
coach
Jack
Martgenhaler’s goal of getting to
the conference tournament has
not only been attained, but
surpassed.
M argenthaler’s fifth-seeded
SIUE men’s basketball team will
move on to the second round of
the
Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference tournament with an
85-80 victory over Lewis
University on Tuesday.
The win makes it five in a row
for the Cougars who will face a
No. 1 seeded and No. 4 nationally

ranked Kentucky Wesleyan
squad on Friday.
“This team played as hard and
as consistent as they could play,”
Margenthaler said about his
group of players.
Havana native Rusty Sarnes
led SIUE in scoring for the the
sixth time in the last eight games
with a 21-point performance to
go along with his game-high 12
rebounds.
Effingham’s Nathan Kreke did
his share on the offensive end
scoring 18 points and grabbing
seven boards.
Shaun Smoot, of Natchez,
Miss., added 14 points and went a
perfect 12 of 12 from the free-

throw line. Smoot also dished out
a game-high six assists.
Sophomore Travis Wallbaum
reached double figures in scoring
with a 12-point and five-rebound
night.
“The key to closing out this
game was our free-throw
shooting,” Margenthaler said. “In
the past we’ve had problems in
this department, but when they
fouled us late, we were able to
stay focused and complete our
free-throws.”
Margenthaler sees a tough
taslc in moving past top seeded
Kentucky Wesleyan, but he has
tremendous confidence that his
team can come out of this game

with a win.
“They have a phenomenal
player in Dana Williams,”
Margenthaler said. “He’ll be
playing in the NBA in the future.
“He’s capable of scoring 40
points so we have to make sure
we contain him.”
The senior combination of
Sarnes and Kreke have been
sharing the offensive load as they
are both averaging over 14 points
per game. Kreke became only the
10th player in SIUE history to
score 1,000 career points with a
21-point night against MissouriSt. Louis last Saturday.
Sarnes scored a career-high 31
points in last week’s win over

Quincy. He and junior Tommy
Shurn are among the top threepoint shooters in the GLVC.
Sarnes is shooting 43 percent
while Shurn is knocking down 40
percent from downtown.
The Cougars are trying to
capitalize on what has been
Margenthaler’s best season at
SIUE with a record of 17-8
overall and 12-7 in GLVC action.
If the Cougars go on to win the
conference tournament, they
would receive an automatic birth
in the NCAA tournament.
The Cougars play Friday night
at Kentucky Wesleyan. Tipoff is
at 8 p.m.

Cougar wrestling sending
best to NCAA Regional
Tourney this weekend
■ BY BRIAN
ANDERSON
SPORTS REPORTER
The Cougar wrestling team
will look to make a strong
showing this Sunday when they
take part in the NCAA Division II
Regional Tournament
This
national qualifying
tournament, a possible seasonending event, includes 10 teams
from the Midwest Conference.
Qualifiers include only the top
two wrestlers in each weight
class and seven wild card
wrestlers who are voted on by the
coaches.
SIUE finished the regular
season 1-15 as a team, but that
says
nothing
about
the
individuals that stuck in there and
competed against some top
Division I schools.
“We faced excellent Division I
and Division II schools,” Coach
Booker Benford said. “Every one
of our wrestlers competing in the
regional tournament should feel
proud because they hung in there
and wrestled tough. Our wrestlers
have wrestled with the best, are in
very good shape, and are as
talented as anyone else. I
honestly believe everyone has a
chance to qualify for the National
Tournament.”
The Cougars will head into
Regionals this weekend lead by
Centerville native Titus Taylor.
The former Illinois State Runnerup and Junior College National
Runner-up posts a 16-5 record
and holds a modest but confident
attitude.
“The experience of wrestling
those Division I opponents this

season
has
prepared
me
physically and has given me
reason to feel confident,” Taylor
said. “I will do well at the
Division II level.”
Another
Junior
College
National
Runner-up, Jessie
Montez, is planing to make the
trip to Pueblo Colorado for the
National Tournament.
“Jessie’s technique is still a
little rusty after entering the
season midway through, but he is
in great shape and constantly
goes after his opponents,” Coach
Benford said of Montezs’ ability.
Senior Kris Davis has his
hopes set on making a trip to
Pueblo, Colo. Davis is from
Riverdale High School and
placed 3rd in 1993 with his team.
Senior Craig Panell is a
veteran
whose
experience,
dedication and hard work will
only help him to qualify for the
National Tournament. Panell
placed 3rd in Illinois in 1993 and
wrestled for two years at Harper
College. In his second year here
at SIUE, Panell has the potential
to become a Division II AllAmerican.
The Cougars only returning
All-American, Jason Carter,
recently received a season ending
injury.
Carter tore his ACL in his left
knee and cannot wrestle with that
kind of injury. He is a two-time
All-Academic award winner,
1997 All-American wrestler, on
the Dean’s list and an Athletic
Board member.
The Cougars send their best to
Edmond, Oklahoma this Sunday
to compete in the NCAA
Division II regionalS.
