Engineering
building to
give program
more visibility

■ BY DA N IELLE

EDITOR IN CHIEF
SIUE’s
International
Education Task Force has plans in
the works to help increase
international student enrollment.
Formed in the Fall of 1996,
the task force’s goal is to increase
international student enrollment
that has dropped in recent years at
SIUE and SIUC. The Board of
Trustees is hoping to reverse the
trend by reducing the cost of the
out-of-state tuition rate to only
twice the in-state rate. Previously
the rate had been placed at three
times that amount.
Other plans to help attract
international students are also
underway, including a brochure
to be developed to help promote
SIUE
international
student
opportunities as well as the
enhancement of the International
Host Family Program. A mini­
grant has been developed in an
effort to support the international
initiatives by the faculty and a
pool of funds are being developed
to help international students at a
time in crisis, such as their home
country’s economic collapse.
SIUE will also continue its
Intensive English Program. First
initiated in Fall of 1996, the
program helps international
students raise their Test of
English as a Foreign Language
scores. Since 1996, the program
has served 22 students.
The International Education
Task Force’s purpose is to assess
how SIUE handles the education
of international students as well
as making recommendations to
strengthen the initiatives that
encourage international students
to attend SIUE.
Recommendations made by
the committee are reviewed by the
Provost and the Vice Chancellor
of Student Affairs. They evolve a
number of offices, academic
departments and units.

EDITOR IN CHIEF
Dean of graduate studies and
research, Abdul M. Turay,
stepped down from his position
on May 15 to return to full time
teaching and research at SIUE.
SIUE Chancellor David

Werner accepted Turay’s request
to resigned. He will be reassigned
to the School of Business,
Department of Economics. The
position will be effective as of
July 1, 1998.
Turay has served as Dean of
the Graduate School for three
years.
In a letter Turay released

about his reassignment, he listed
some of the goals he was able to
obtain while working as the Dean
of the Graduate School. Some of
the goals he helped promote were
the Paul Simon Teaching and
Research Awards Program and
the 1996 PQP graduate degree
program. Turay also helped
increase the submission to grant
proposals by 23 percent.

Visibility for an engineering
program that was often hard to
find on campus is one of the
purposes of the new engineering
building to be built at SIUE.
SIU President Ted Sanders
conducted a news briefing with
SIUE Chancellor David Werner
discussing budget issues and the
groundbreaking of the new
engineering building.
Sanders opened the briefing
discussing the fiscal budget for
next year as well as future budget
plans, not yet approved by the
Board of Trustees.
The main focus of the
briefing was on the new addition
of the Engineering Building on
campus. Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar
was to attend the afternoon
groundbreaking ceremony for the
university on Tuesday.
The new facility will provide
a home for the engineering
program here at SIUE. The
program has been currently
housed partially in the Science
Building and in rental space in
University
Park.
SIUE
Chancellor David Werner said
that he hopes that the building
“will have a visibility to attract
new students to the campus.”
The Engineering Building
will cost over $21 million, with
an additional $6 million for
needed equipment for the various
engineering programs it will
house.
According to Werner, the
engineering program currently
has over 700 students, and he is
hoping to see a steady increase
once the building is completed in
the spring of 2000. Work will
start this month.

Teen wins lawsuit claiming she was wrongly arrested
NORMAL, 111. (AP) — When
18-year-old Julie Bisbee called her
father from the local jail, she wasn’t
scared as much as angry.
She’d just been given a
Breathalyzer, se /eral hours after
sheriff’s deputies had stopped her
from leaving a party at the home of a
high school classmate. She wasn’t
charged with anything, and Bisbee,
who hadn’t been drinking, was
eventually sent home.
But she felt she’d been wrongly
arrested, so she sued. And she won.
Some folks are outraged, saying
officers were just doing their job. But
Bisbee says she’s following the ideals
taught her by her father - who was, in
this case, the constitutional lawyer
who represented her.
With her freckles, sneakers and
scabbed knee, Bisbee could be
anyone in a crowd of teen-agers. But
her independence streak runs deep —
even by adolescent standards.
She worked 38 hours a week
through much of her senior year,
keeping a 4.0 GPA, to raise money
and rent her own apartment in
Normal, where she now lives. Her
father, John Bisbee, calls the
move “her own emancipation
proclamation.”
And since the Bisbees filed their
civil rights lawsuit seeking damages
in Peoria’s federal courthouse, Miss
Bisbee has kept her own copies of the
court papers, and can quickly refer to
parts of a file that is as thick as two
phone books.
She rolls her eyes when her
father refers to Thomas Jefferson,
John Locke and the Magna Carta
when discussing her case. But she’ll

study political science and history
when she begins classes this fall at the
University of Illinois.
“People still really don’t
understand how I won,” Bisbee said.
“I grew up with this around the dinner
table, conversations about the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.”
What happened on Feb. 14,
1997, could have happened in any
town where teen-agers roam on
Friday nights. About 7 p.m., Julie
Bisbee left her hotel job and jumped
in a car with some girlfriends. After
stops at the high school basketball
game and McDonalds, they drove to a
classmate’s house for a party.
They were there for half an hour
before piling into the car again to
leave. As they were about to turn out
of the driveway, a police cruiser
stopped them.
Someone in the house had made
a “hang-up” 911 call. The McLean
County sheriff’s deputy, who in court
papers said he didn’t smell alcohol
in the car or see any problems with
the girls, directed them back into
the house.
At that point, John Bisbee
argued, his daughter was technically
arrested, and arrested without reason.
Once at the door of the house,
the deputies asked to come in, saying
the weather was bad. Inside, they saw
bottles, a beer keg in the bath tub.
Everyone, including Bisbee, was
taken in a van to the jail, where
they were frisked and given
Breathalyzers. Those who showed
traces of alcohol were written up for
underage drinking.
In court papers, Paul Welch, the
lawyer for the McLean County
officials, said the “hang-up” 911
call gave the deputies the obligation

to ensure everyone’s safety. The
deputies said that once they saw
underage drinkers, they wanted to
make sure no one was passed out
or hurt.
But in his April decision, U.S.
District Judge Michael Mihm wrote
that the law specifically forbids what
the police did with Bisbee that night.
The officers, he said, had no
probable cause to order Bisbee into
the house in the first place, nor to hold
her in custody.
What the deputies needed to
order Bisbee and her friends out of the
car and into the house was a reason,
such as a beer bottle or the smell of
alcohol in the car, Kit Kinports, a civil
law professor at the University of
Illinois who wasn’t involved with the
case, said.
McLean County has no plans to
appeal, Welch said.
A hearing is set for later this
month to determine damages.
The Bisbee lawsuit stirred
passionate responses in McLean
County. Judy Hostelhom, who wrote
letters to the local paper on the case
and has two grown children, said the
police were right to break up a teen­
age beer blast, and said Mihm should
have thrown out the Bisbee lawsuit.
“Underage drinking is against
the law,” she said. “I’m very strongly
for protecting the rights that we have.
But I also think we need to use them
kind of cautiously.”
Bisbee’s father said he is proud
his daughter stood up to the
authorities.
“Every day in the federal courts
we’re doing what the whole
Revolutionary War was all about,” he
said. “No one in her peer group did it,
or joined her. It took a lot of courage
on her part.”

Little problem grows up Letters to the editor
to become big problem
Typing is harder today as usual. Due to a freak
incident with one of my finger nails, 1 have no use of my
index Finger on my right hand. My second finger is a poor
substitute. But my finger isn’t the only thing harder today.
Apparently high school is harder in rural communities
Danielle [han it used to be.
Belton
As part of a generation of cynics, I wasn’t really
surprised by the shootings in Springfield, Oregon. I
couldn’t understand how rural communities could think that they
were immune to violence. No one and no community has ever been
immune to anything. I, remember how some people in the midwest
thought that they’d have no chance of ever getting AIDS because that
was a “big city” epidemic. Rural areas have AIDS and other “big city”
problems as well. But the small town mentality is powerful.
My mother is from a small town called Newport. I spent a lot of
time in Newport because my grandmother and majority of my
mother’s family lived there. Although it was the 1990’s, many things
in Newport haven’t changed since they desegregated the high school
in the seventies. Often people there asked me if I liked it in Newport
and 1 would say yes. I’d always say that it was quite nice and peaceful,
and I loved seeing my family. Then they’d find out I was from St.
Louis and they’d assume I was from the city. They felt they were
much safer in Newport than 1 was in St. Louis, and it must be a relief
to come to Newport were I wouldn’t have to dodge bullets from drivebys and crack dealers. Needless to say, that just confused me because
I’d never been in a drive-by and never seen a gun fired. I was from
the county: a place not immune to violence, but where people had
enough money to just cover things up.
I found this odd that they saw the city as being so dangerous since
most of the children in their town were familiar with guns, they had
their own street gang, rampant teenage pregnancy and a drug
problem. Yet, I’m sure that if anything ever happened in Newport like
what happened in Springfield, they would be shocked as well. People
tend to ignore the problem when it’s small and are often in denial.
The signs of potential problems are there, but no one does
anything until the problem is almost too large to deal with. In
Springfield, the boy arrested for the shootings made bombs, brought
a gun to school, blew up small animals and threw rocks off bridges at
passing cars. I refuse to believe that's just “boys will be boys”
behavior. That’s sociopathic behavior. If people paid attention when
he was just being a little violent instead of when he started committing
homicide, this could have been avoided.
Problems start off slow. It starts with just one small incident; then
it slowly begins to grow until it explodes. Then everyone stands
around and wonders what went wrong. Small towns shouldn’t make
the same mistakes big cities did by ignoring the problem until it gets
too big to contain it. They should learn to head these problems off at
the source and try some prevention. People shouldn’t assume that just
because a problem is small (i.e. a child) that it won't become
dangerous. They can’t assume that the problem will run its course,
then disappear. Or that it will work out its aggression a become a lawabiding citizen before it harms someone.
Like my broken fingernail, if I’d taken care of it when it first
started to break, I might have saved it. Now I have a bloody index
finger with half it’s nail gone and a large cotton ball with tape on top
of it.
Take it from Springfield and my finger, don't wait.

Agency shows aggressiveness
with aging airplanes
Critics have long worried that
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration was tom by its
dual obligations to promote safety
and the airline industry. The
agency recently showed unusual
aggressiveness, however, in its
swift handling of fuel-tank
concerns for older Boeing 737s.
In the most widespread
grounding in 19 years, the agency
ordered immediate inspections of
179 airplanes after chafing was
found on 115-volt wires inside a
conduit that ran through fuel
tanks. Experts worried that
exposed wires could create
sparks, and possibly a fire or
explosion. Though immediate
inspections of 737s threatened to
disrupt air traffic nationwide, the
FAA was obviously correct in its
aggressive approach. By quickly
shipping repair kits, Boeing
helped minimize delays to the
flying public.
Last year, the White House
Commission on Aviation Safety

and Security called on the FAA to
adopt more aggressive inspections
with older planes, especially nonstructural parts, such as fuel
pumps and wiring. The FAA is
moving to implement new
procedures. Congress should
make sure the agency is
adequately staffed to handle
increased chores.
As
this
episode
demonstrated, dangers lurk in
hidden areas. Greater scrutiny is
justified. This latest episode may
be a welcome sign of a more
aggressive FAA.

From the Seattle Times, Seattle,
on the FAA

Securing our borders
We are a nation of
immigrants — always have been.
From Ellis Island on the East
Coast to Angel Island on the West
Coast, America welcomed those
who hoped to cash in on the
promises of a free country.
And still today, from across
the world, people come to the
United States in search of a better
life for themselves and their
families.

That was the case with most
of the undocumented aliens who
were deported from Springfield
this week. Of the 67 arrested in an
operation by Immigration and
Naturalization Service officers,
only 13 were criminals who had
committed crimes while in this
country. Those 13 were part of a
list of 80 criminal illegal aliens
who were the target of Operation
Impact.
The other 54 were mostly
hard workers with families who
counted on them. They left their
home countries to build a future in
a country that held more promise.
But there was one problem. They
were here illegally.
When the INS came across
them instead of the 80 known
criminals on its list, the federal
officers had to do their jobs and
arrest them. To have done
otherwise would have meant
ignoring federal laws.
Those laws are there for a
reason. All countries have a right
to control their borders. Not only
do they have a right, they have an
obligation and duty to make sure
those borders are secure.

From the News-Leader on
illegal immigration

All Danielle.
All the time.

reporter here at the Alestle for the summer session. If you are,

Unfortunately, instead of
people focusing on the sadness
of Phil Hartman's death last
weekend, most of the talk I have
heard has been about the grisly
nature of his demise and the
existence of a supposed
"Saturday Night Live" curse.
Now sure, it's unusual that
Hartman’s death came so soon
after Chris Farley's, which was
back in December. But an SNL
curse? Come on. The show has
had hundreds of cast members
over its nearly 25 year run.
By my count, only six cast
members have died. John
Belushi and Andy Kaufman in
the early '80s, Gilda Radner in
the late '80s, Danitra Vance in
the early '90s and Farley and
Hartman in the last year —
Hardly enough to call it a curse.
Oh, wait, I forgot Chevy Chase's
career. That was a real tragedy.
Television and movie curses
have been talked about for years.
I don't believe in them, for the
most part. (Of course, I never go
out of my way to piss off a
Gypsy either. So that must make
me a bit skeptical.)
The first I remember was the
helicopter crash that chopped up
Vic Morrow and two kids during
the "Twilight Zone" movie
filming. Doo-dee-doo-doo. Doodee-doo-doo. Yeah, creepy. Then
there was the little “Poltergeist”
girl Heather O’Rourke, who died
during the filming of the second
sequel from infection. More
recently, trouble occurred on the
Eddie Murphy film “Vampire in
Brooklyn,” when numerous
accidents occurred and a
stuntwoman was actually killed.
I guess people feel more
comfortable when they say
something is cursed rather than
passing the blame onto the
deserving party.
Now, if tv curses do really
exist, does anyone know how to
slap one on “Party of Five?”

Perhaps its sadly fitting that two weeks after the Chairman
of the Board tipped his hat, the man who did the best
impression of him also drifted off in to the great unknown.
Phil Hartman was a riotous comic actor who performed
for nearly a decade on “Saturday Night Live” (SNL) and for
the last three years as Bill McNeal on the NBC sitcom
“Newsradio.”
Of course, that is just the surface of Hartman’s career. He
made forays into animation and feature films throughout the
‘80s and ‘90s, leaving a touch of hilarity wherever he went.
“I was honored to work with Phil in both film and
animation,” said Savage Steve Holland, who directed
Hartman in the film “How I Got Into College.” “He was one
of the sweetest and funniest humans I have ever met.”
Hartman never appeared to be the squeaky wheel. During
his eight seasons with SNL, never was a bad word heard
about him. And he never hogged the spotlight, either. He
performed with a quiet grace that left a lasting impression,
with turns as Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, Ted Kennedy,
Jesus, Barbara Bush and Saddam Hussein on SNL.
“I spent eight years as a cast member on this show. I did
153 episodes, played 518 characters and wore 627 wigs,”
Hartman said, reflecting on his years at SNL.
Fans and friends are dismayed by his death, partly
because they knew he had many years of comic brilliance left
to offer.
“The other night I had a “Phil-Fest” at my house ... and it
broke my heart. I feel blessed to have had the opportunity to
have worked with Phil. He’ll be sorely missed,” Holland said. Autographed photo o f the late Phil Hartman

Sunday was not sugar and spice and
everything nice for a certain quintet that
became a quartet.
Geri Halliwell, aka Ginger Spice, left
the Spice Girls, citing creative differences.
Her announcement came only two weeks
before the super-group was about to begin
its massive United States tour, which will
arrive at Riverport Amphitheater in July:
“Sadly, I would like to confirm that I
have left the Spice Girls. This is because
of differences between us. I’m sure that

group will continue to be successful and I
wish them all the b e s t... PS. I’ll be back.”
The other four will continue touring
and possibly record another album. They
released a statement wishing Halliwell
well.
It is unclear at this point in what facet
Ginger Spice will return to the public eye.
She is rumored to be looking into
television. At the very least should be able
to find work as she previously did: posing
nude.
Certainly 13-year-old pubescent boys
were crushed at Halliwell’s decision to
leave the Spice Girls. But it must be what
she wants; what she really, really wants.

Warner Bros., the movie studio that spawned
Bugs Bunny and the rebirth of Batman, is
celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. As part of
the festivities, they are bringing a group of some of
their most critically acclaimed and popular films
back to the big screen.
Starting on Friday, June 12, the Tivoli Theater in
the University City Loop will feature 30 films. The
festival will last through Thursday, June 18, and
each day will feature films from a different decade.
Friday’s films are from the ‘70s and include
“Blazing Saddles,” “The Exorcist” and “A
Clockwork Orange.” Saturday’s ‘80s films include
“The Color Purple,” “The Shining” and “Blade
Runner.” Sunday’s films are from the ‘90s, while
Monday through Thursday, films from the ‘30s
through the ‘60s are going to be shown.
Other features will include “Rebel Without a
Cause,” “The Adventures of Robin Hood,”
“Casablanca,” “The Maltese Falcon,” “Goodfellas,”
“The Wild Bunch” and “Driving Miss Daisy.”
Tickets are $6 for each feature, $ 12 for a day pass
or $50 for the entire series and are available at the
Tivoli box office.

SIUE athletics win GLVC’s All-Sports Trophy
With a score o f over 90 points, SIUE out-scores Southern Indiana and Lewis University fo r its first trophy
■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
The season for Cougar
sports was a winning one.
After winning three Great
Lakes Valley Conference
Championships and having
several spectacular individual
and team finishes, SIUE was
awarded the GLVC’s AllSports Trophy.
This is the first time that
SIUE has won the All-Sports
Trophy. In previous years,
SIUE has come in fifth place
for the 1995-96 season and
tied for second during the
1996-97 season.
SIUE qualified for this

honor by competing against
the 12 other institutions in the
GLVC. The scoring was based
on the top ten finishes, five
women’s sports and five mens
sports.
SIUE
won
the
competition with a score of 93
points. University of Southern
Indiana came in second at
84.5, while last year’s
champion, Lewis University,
placed third with 83.5 points.
“This is an outstanding
achievement for our studentathletes and coaches,” SIUE
athletic director, Cindy Jones,
said. “Our student-athletes
and coaches have worked very
hard all year and deserve
recognition for this honor.”
The scoring for the

competition is relative to an
institution’s final standing in
each sport. A point value equal
to the number of competing
institutions is assigned for
first place with one point less
for second to one point for
last place.
All institutions must have
men’s basketball, wom en’s
basketball, baseball, softball,
men’s soccer and volleyball
counted in the competition,
since all 12 schools in the
GLVC sponsor these sports.
Defending
champion
Lewis University has won the
most of these competitions
since the All-Sports Trophy
was first presented for the

1985-86
sports
season,
including the first All-Sports
Trophy. Lewis won these
trophies by sweeping men’s
and women’s cross country
and track. SIUE was second
with conference titles in men’s
soccer, men’s tennis and
baseball. Southern Indiana
and Saint Joseph’s each had
two GLVC titles.
SIUE’s All-Sports Trophy
will be on display in the
Cougar trophy case in
Vadalabene Center for the
1998-99 season. The 1997-98
season was SIUE’s third
complete year as a member of
the GLVC.

SuperSonic coach fired two weeks after playoff elimination
SEATTLE (AP) — Seattle
SuperSonics coach George Karl
was fired Tuesday, two weeks
after his team was eliminated in
the second round of the playoffs,
a team source said.
The SuperSonics called an
afternoon news conference to
announce that Karl’s contract
will not be renewed, the source
said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

Karl, who was paid $ 3.2
million this season, coached the
Sonics for 6 1/2 seasons and had
the best winning percentage
(.719, 384-150) in the club’s
regular-season history.
He got the Sonics to the
playoffs in all seven of his
seasons in Seattle. However, his
contract was up July 1, and with
no new offer from team president
Wally Walker, Karl knew he had

run out of time in Seattle.
This is the thifd time the
former ABA player has been fired
as coach: by Cleveland in 1986
and by Golden State two years
later. He took over in Seattle in
1992, leaving his Spanish club to
replace K.C. Jones.
Karl is expected to be
gobbled up in the coaching
market and get a long-term
contract that will pay him $ 5

million next season.
The 47-year-old coach had
hoped that this season he would
produce Seattle’s second NBA
championship. He led an aging
team to a 61-21 record and its
third Pacific Division title in
a row. However, the Sonics
were knocked out of the playoffs
by the Los Angeles Lakers on
May 12.

Two years ago, the Sonics,
led by Gary Payton and Shawn
Kemp, made it to the NBA Finals
against the Chicago Bulls, losing
in six games.
Clearly,
Karl’s playoff
record was held against him.
The Sonics were upset in the
first round of the playoffs by
Denver in 1994 and by the Lakers
in 1995.

New NASCAR is nothing compared to the pioneers of the old
■ Associated Press
The late Curtis Turner liked
to say that stock-car racing never
would have started if the federal
government hadn’t chosen to tax
moonshine.
It’s well documented that
Turner and many of the pioneer
drivers of NASCAR built their
first fast cars to outrun revenue
agents while hauling white
lightning.
But that was 50 years ago.
Back then, the fledgling
sport existed mostly for the
entertainment of good ol’ boys
in the southeastern United
States. The drivers were harddriving, hard-drinking, hardplaying men from the farm or the
service station.
Quite often, the spectators
were the same.
Now, NASCAR is a billiondollar business, full of glitz,
race tracks with luxury suites
and drivers with razor-cut hair.
From the spectacular growth
curve, it seems to appeal to just
about everyone.
The new young stars of the

sport bear little resemblance to
those of a half-century ago. But
they do have one thing in
common — the desire to race
door-to-door and win.
The biggest star in the sport
right now is Jeff Gordon, 26
years old and already a winner of
32 races and two Winston Cup
championships.
Gordon, bom in California,
moved to Indiana as a teen-ager
to drive race cars in the Midwest
without a license.
John Bickford, his stepfather
and the man who oversaw his
climb from go-karts to Winston
Cup, took Gordon to the track the
first time, but it was the boy who
wanted to go back.
“When he was nine, he’d
been racing karts for four years,
and I thought he was getting a
little burned out.” Bickford said.
“I told him to take the summer
off, play with his friends and
we’d see about racing.”
After two months of riding
bicycles, swimming and just
playing around, Gordon knew
what he wanted.
“He said, ‘Let’s go racing.’”
Bickford recalled. “He hasn’t

stopped since.”
That story is a fairly
common among the young guns
now challenging the established
Winston Cup stars.
Of course, one path to the
big time is through family.
Among the hot prospects in
the Busch Series are thirdgeneration
drivers
Dale
Earnhardt Jr. and Jason Jarrett,
son of Dale Jarrett. Coming soon
are others — Terry Labonte’s
son, Justin; Kyle Petty’s son,
Adam; and Sterling Marlin’s son,
Steadman — all racing now at
lower levels.
“This has always been a
family business,” said Kyle
Petty, who followed his father,
Richard, and his grandfather,
Lee, to the NASCAR ovals. “I
can’t remember a time when it
wasn’t part of my life, and my
daddy says the same thing.
“I wouldn’t be encouraging
my son to be part of it if I
didn’t believe it was a decent
and worthwhile way to make
a living.”
Like Gordon, Tony Stewart
is coming to stock cars by way of
midwestern short tracks and

open-wheel cars.
The 27-year-old Indiana
native is the only driver to win
titles in all three of the U.S. Auto
Club’s top divisions — Silver
Crown, sprint and midget — in
the same year. Since then, he has
moved up to the Indy Racing
League, where he won the series
championship in 1997, and the
Busch Series, where he drives for
Joe Gibbs Racing.
The plan is for Stewart to
move into Winston Cup next year
as Bobby Labonte’s teammate.
His path to the big time has a
familiar ring, starting with a
child’s car in the back yard.
“My mom was so furious at
the amount of yard that I tore up.
It was ‘Something’s got to go.’ So
we got a racing cart and started in
that,” Stewart said. “I guess I was
eight years old.
“At that age, you don’t know
anything about what you want to
do, but I was just having fun
doing it. I didn’t mind giving up
things to do that. I didn’t go hang
out with my friends on the
weekends — I went racing. That
was fine with me.”
Jeremy Mayfield, a 28-year-

old who stands second in the
Winston Cup standings, heard the
siren song of stock cars from his
hometown of Owensboro, Ky.
“My uncle and my dad kind
of messed with racing some, and
I hung around them some,”
Mayfield said. “But I don’t know
if that’s what got me thinking
about it or not. All I can tell you
is as long as I can remember, I’ve
wanted to drive stock cars and be
in Winston Cup racing.”
Rookie Jerry Nadeau took
another route to the top.
The
27-year-old
from
Danbury, Conn., came by way
of the Skip Barber Racing
School in Sears Point, Calif.,
the Formula Opal Series in
Europe and IMSA’s sports-car
endurance series.
“I guess you can say it
wasn’t a traditional stock-car
background,” Nadeau said. “But
it is a racing background.
“Originally, I figured I
would wind up in an Indy-car
racing in the Indianapolis 500.
But, the road took me to
NASCAR and the Daytona 500,
and I couldn’t be happier.”

Williams vs. Hingis in French Quarters
PARIS (AP) — Martina
Hingis and Venus Williams are
headed for a quarterfinal
showdown, setting up one of the
most intriguing matches at the
French Open.
But the other Williams sister,
Serena, is out. Her game
nosedived after a strong first set
and she lost to Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
On the men’s side, No. 3
seed Marcelo Rios was one step
from regaining the top ranking.
The Chilean moved into the
quarters with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3
victory over Albert Costa of
Spain. If he makes the semifinals,
he’ll oust Pete Sampras from the

No. 1 spot.
While the American men
have bombed at the French Open,
the American women are doing
just fine. Three advanced to the
final eight Sunday.
Hingis, the top seed and
world’s No. 1 player, beat Anna
Smashnova of Israel 6-1, 6-2.
Still, Hingis said, “It wasn’t as
easy as I thought it was going
to be.”
Venus Williams reached the
quarters with a 6-1, 6-3 victory
over Henrieta Nagy ova of
Slovakia. Venus slammed seven
aces to none for her opponent.
In a match between two of
the game’s headline players,

she’ll meet Hingis, the top seed
and No. 1 player. Hingis beat
Anna Smashnova of Israel 6-1,62. “Still,” she said, “It wasn’t
as easy as I thought it was going
to be.”
Serena
Williams,
meanwhile,
overpowered
Sanchez Vicario early on with
backhand winners. She surged to
a 5-2 lead in the second set, but
then could not seem to hit a good
shot. Sanchez Vicario, the No. 4
seed from Spain, won five
straight games to take the
second set.
In the third set, Sanchez
Vicario broke to lead 2-1, then
broke again in the final game.

No.
2
seed
Lindsay
Davenport advanced with a 6-3,
4-6, 6-2 victory over Sandrine
Testud of France.
And No. 6 Monica Seles
completed the American trio in
the quarters, easily beating
Chanda Rubin, 6-1, 6-4. Patty
Schnyder of Switzerland also
advanced with a 6-1, 6-3 win
over Magui Serna of Spain.
Former
French
Open
champion Thomas Muster of
Austria advanced to the quarters
with a five-set win over Fernando
Meligeni of Brazil, 6-4, 6-7 (8-6),
6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
In another five-setter, No. 14
seed Alex Corretja of Spain

downed Hernan Gumy of
Argentina 6-1, 5-7,6-7 (4-7), 7-5,
9-7. The third-round match,
which had been pushed back
because of rain, took five and a
half hours.
Reaching the quarters was
No. 15 Felix Mantilla of Spain,
who easily beat Ramon Delgado
of Paraguay 6-2, 6-2, 6-4.
Delgado ousted Sampras in the
second round.
In yet another victory for
Spain, No. 12 Carlos Moya made
it to the quarters with a 6-3, 7-5,
3-6, 6-4 victory over Jens
Knippschild of Germany.

Shaquille simmers after another sweep
INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) —
Shaquille O’Neal was simmering,
sitting at his locker after his team
endured another sweep. He scored
38 points two days after getting
39, and it wasn’t good enough.
He knows that feeling all
too well.
“Every time I get eliminated,
it’s a sweep,” he said softly. “I’m
very frustrated, I’m very [angry].
I’ve got to go home and live
with it.”
The Utah Jazz beat the Los
Angeles Lakers 96-92 on Sunday
to complete a 4-0 sweep and
advance
to
the
National
Basketball Association Finals
against either Chicago or Indiana.
Three years ago, O’Neal led the
Orlando Magic to the NBA
Finals, but the Houston Rockets
won in four games. That’s the
closest he’s come to an NBA title

in six seasons.
The Lakers were beaten in
five games by Utah in last year’s
Western Conference semifinals in
O’Neal’s first season in LA. On
Sunday, it was more of the same,
only worse.
As good as O’Neal was —
he scored 19 of his team’s 35
points in the fourth quarter — his
game is still flawed by poor
foul shooting. He was 10-of-18
on Sunday, including 7-of-12
in the fourth quarter. The Jazz,
meanwhile,
were
30-of-33,
including
12-of-13 in the
final period.
However, O ’Neal certainly
did his share, which is more than
can be said for some of his
teammates, who were terrific
against Seattle but terrible against
the Jazz.
O’Neal made 14-of-24 shots
Sunday; his teammates were a
combined 18-of-50 (36 percent).

For three quarters, O ’Neal was 8of-17; the other Lakers were 11of-40.
“Guys just have to step up,”
O ’Neal said. “If they don’t want to
play, they need to ask for a trade.
If they don’t want to play, then get
the [...] off my team.”
O’Neal said the Lakers need
to set their goals higher next year.
“These guys over there are
hungry, probably hungrier than we
were,” he said of the Jazz.
“Congratulations to them. It
wasn’t even their legends that
killed us, it was everybody else.
“After the Seattle series, we
got comfortable. All last year, all
this year, we’re hearing how we
couldn’t touch Seattle, they were
the greatest team ever, we
couldn’t touch them.”
Perhaps the Lakers peaked
too early. Certainly, their outside
shooters did. Los Angeles made

19-of-74 shots (25.7 percent) from
3-point range against Utah after
going 41-of-93 (44.1 percent)
against Seattle.
‘They did a great job with
their game plan, not letting us
perimeter guys do our thing,”
Nick Van Exel said, who was 10of-42 from the floor and 4-of-21
from beyond the 3-point line in
the conference finals. “It hurts.
Whether we would have lost 4-3
or 4-0, it wouldn’t make any
difference.
“It’s tough. One week you’re
the greatest team, the next, you’re
broken down to reality.”
Point guard Derek Fisher was
near tears in the locker room. The
other perimeter players — Eddie
Jones and Kobe Bryant — were
apparently too upset to speak with
reporters, disappearing before the
locker room opened.

“[Shaq] came here to win a
championship,” Fisher said. “He
did everything he could do. We
tried, I think. We just could not
knock the shots down. Sweeping
us proves they were the better
team in this series.
“There will be a lot of
stuff said, a lot of stuff written.
We intended to go out there
and win basketball games, we
just couldn’t.”
The Lakers were 61-21
during the regular season, and 7-2
in the playoffs before running into
the Jazz.
“To me, it’s a big upset that
they swept us,” reserve forward
Corie Blount said. “I didn’t think
anyone could sweep us, as well
as we were playing at the end of
the season.”

Leslie scored 16 points and caught nine rebounds to lead the United States
BREMEN, Germany (AP) Lisa Leslie’s 21 points, 12
rebounds and four blocked shots
helped keep the United States
unbeaten in the Women’s World
Championship, as the Americans
rolled over Spain 79-68 Sunday.
The Americans dominated
the boards getting 20 offensive
rebounds to just two for Spain,
and out-rebounding the Spanish
56-23 overall.
The victory sets up a Group
E championship game against
unbeaten Russia Monday. The
winner will have the top seed
going into the single-elimination
finals in Berlin June 4-7.

Spanish coach
Manuel
Coloma said after the game that
the Americans were the best team
in the championship.
“The USA plays more like
a team than the Russians,”
Coloma said.
That strength will be crucial
for the Americans, who shot
poorly from the outside against
Spain. They didn’t make their
first three-pointer until less than a
minute remained in the game,
and finished 1-for-11 from
beyond the arc.
Other top U.S. scorers were
post player Natalie Williams with
13, and Chamique Holdsclaw,

who scored her 11 points inside
as well.
Spain was led by guard Ana
Belen Alvaro, who scored 16
points on six-of-nine shooting.
Russia (5-0) kept its record
perfect with an easy 103-76 win
over Japan (2-3). The Americans
only defeated the Japanese by
six, 95-89, in the first game of the
tournament.
Elena Baranova of the Utah
Starzz had 19 points, 11
rebounds, two assists and two
steals for Russia, and surprise
starter Nadeja Marilova finished
with 18 on 7-of-9 shooting.
Akemi Okazato led the

Japanese — who must now beat
China Tuesday to qualify for the
finals — with 20 points.
In the first game of the day,
Lithuania (2-3) kept its chances
of moving on to the finals alive
with a 72-70 victory over China
(1-4) with 18 points from Loreta
Beruksteine.
The Lithuanians controlled
the game throughout except for
4:42 stretch in the first half,
during which the Chinese ran
off 18 unanswered points. The
key to that run was Zheng Haixia,
who finished with 24 points and
11 rebounds.
The top four teams from

Group E will join the top four
teams from Group F, which are
playing in Berlin the finals
June 4-7.
In Group F action, Australia
(5-0) defeated Slovakia (2-3), 8257, as 17-year-old center Lauren
Jackson was once again the
leading scorer, this time with 17
points in 16 minutes.
Magic Paula had 23 points
and the tourney’s leading scorer,
Janeth Arcain of the Houston
Comets, had 22 as Brazil (5-0)
knocked off Cuba (3-2) 88-79.
Host Germany (2-3) beat
Hungary (1-4), 79-69.

Shutterbug Mills returns to Orioles after two-game suspension from May brawl
BALTIMORE
(AP) —
Having had some time to brush
up on his photography skills,
Alan Mills returned to the
Baltimore Orioles on Sunday.
Mills rejoined the Baltimore
bullpen after serving a two-game
suspension for punching Darryl
Strawberry during a May 19
brawl between the New York
Yankees and Orioles. He used the
time off to enjoy a hobby he

practiced years ago.
The right-hander positioned
himself in the photographers’
well Saturday night at Camden
Yards as Baltimore faced Texas
and took some shots of his
teammates.
They, in turn, took shots at
him Sunday.
After seeing Mills on ESPN
with camera in hand, Doug
Drabek yelled across the

clubhouse,“You’re on TV, dude.
You’re busted, caught, fined!”
Mills wasn’t sure whether
the suspension allowed him on
the field with a camera instead of
a glove, but he did it anyway.
*‘I still don’t know if it’s
something I’m supposed to do,
but I wasn’t in the dugout and I
wasn’t in uniform so I don’t see
any rules that I broke,” he said. “I

just used the day for my
advantage. I never have a chance
to take a picture at a big-league
ballgaine, even though I see them
all the time.”
Mills became interested in
photography as a teen-ager, but
drifted away from the hobby after
someone stole his first camera.
He used a rather expensive
camera of his own Saturday.

“I tried to get a picture of a
double play being turned but it
never happened,” he said.
Minutes later, Mills turned to
shortstop Mike Bordick and said,
“I tried to get you but you
wouldn’t do anything.”
Bordick smiled and replied,
“Every time I looked up and saw
you I stood at attention.”
