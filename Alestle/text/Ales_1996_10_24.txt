Mass Comm students help
WSIE with fundraiser
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
Twenty-five M ass C om m unications students are
volunteering their time to help W SIE raise money.
With federal funding for public radio most likely eroding
during the coming years, public radio stations like W SIE will
have to do m ore fundraising on their own, Tessa M arshall,
developm ental director at W SIE, said.
“O ur annual operating budget is $500,000,” M arshall said.
“We’re responsible for raising $270,000 of that.”
The students have been doing on-air pitching to listeners,
asking the public for help. The fundraiser began M onday and
will run through Sunday. So far, the station has raised $8,000.
“We are St. Louis’ only 24-hour jazz station and we need
the public’s help to m aintain the caliber of program ming
listeners are used to,” M arshall said. The station has been on
the air for the past 25 years, the last ten playing just jazz.
W SIE has been doing a fall fundraiser for only the past
three years, but M arshall said an o th er will have to be

the
opportunity to land a job and

S IU E held the first annual
com bined O ktober C areer Fest
and Volunteer Fair.
“G enerally, we have the
career fair in the spring, but we
were getting feedback from a lot
of em ployers telling us that they
recruit people six m onths in
advance,” Jean Paterson, director
of the D evelopm ent C enter, said.
“So,
in
spring,
they
(em ployers) w ere looking for
people who were graduating in
Decem ber. This puts everyone in
line for the M ay graduates,”
Paterson added.
In addition, she said students
from Principia College in Elsah
and M cK endree C ollege in
Lebanon were attending the fair
because their own facilities were
inadequate for such a m ajor
function.
Ninety-five em ployers and 27
volunteer agencies set up tables
in the G oshen L ounge and
M eridian B allroom in the
U niversity C enter. They w ere

She was lead off to talk to

Professor travels to Brazil
for educational summit
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
Dr. Thomas C. O ’Brien, a professor of
curriculum and instruction at SIU E, had the
opportunity to travel to Rio de Janeiro in
early O ctober for the Third International
Congress on P iagetian A pproaches to
Education.
O ’B rien did m ore than a tten d the
conference, which honored the 100th birthday
of Swiss philosopher and psychologist, Jean
Piaget.
O 'B rien also led a session on “Activities to
Prom ote C hildren's Thinking.”
In 1980, he was one of two N orth
A m ericans to be invited to speak at the
conference. This time, he was one of three
Americans. There were 15 educators who

three-day conference.
“I was pleased to know there were a
num ber of people at the conference who have
been doing things I had introduced them to
(in 1980),” O ’Brien said.
A teacher with 30 years of experience,
O ’Brien finds education to be a battle worth
waging. He believes children are learning
from birth and possibly before.
H e also said that it is the parents’ and the
teachers’ duties to instruct children, and they
can’t take the role too lightly.
E ven though he has been a faculty
m em ber at SIU E since 1970, O ’Brien has
found time to publish over 100 papers on
children’s m athem atical thinking.
He has also received awards for print and

State and Local_________________
Food stamp clients use debit card
A P— President Clinton urged U.S. allies Tuesday to admit a first
group of form er Soviet-dom inated nations into NATO by 1999,
promising ironclad defense against outside aggressors. Republican
rival Bob Dole said Clinton was moving too slowly.
Two weeks before the election, the president raised his voice on a
foreign policy issue of deep interest to M idwestern voters with family
ties in E astern Europe. The seats of Fisher T heater were filled to the
top balcony by supporters cheering “four m ore years.”

A P — A bout 6,800 welfare families in Sangamon County are
the first in Illinois to get food stamps and monthly cash
benefits using a magnetically coded debit card. Instead of
going to currency exchanges to pick up the benefits or
waiting for the mail, the families were able, starting Tuesday,
to use their Link card to get cash from autom atic teller
machines or to buy groceries. State officials say the new
system is faster, cheaper and it’s coming statewide.
Man escapes arrest

At least 26 are killed in Venezuela jail blaze
A P— Flam es consumed a cell in an overcrowded downtowg prison,
killing at least 26 inmates. It was unclear w hether guards or prisoners
started the fire.
D irector of prisons A ntonio M arvel said several guards had thrown
tear-gas canisters into the cell sparking the blaze, but he gave no
specifics. Three guards were detained for interrogation.
M ost of the 26 charred and crum bled bodies were stacked in the 12by-12 cell, the walls of which were fire-blackened.

TELEGRAPH — A 28-year-old man escaped from White
H all’s chief of police by climbing through a basem ent
window. R obert McMillen arrived at David J. Pollard’s house
Tuesday afternoon to arrest him on outstanding warrants for
aggravated arson and criminal damage to property. McMillen
said he allowed Pollard to get dressed before handcuffing
him. Pollard stepped out of sight to get a coat and when he
did not return after a minute, McMillen found that Pollard
had escaped. A canine unit from Pittsfield was quickly
brought in to trace Pollard, but the dog lost the scent in a
nearby cornfield.

letter to the editor.

Abortion is a moral issue not a legal one
I am writing in response to Shonshatara R eddic’s letter in the O ctober 17
edition of the Alestle. Many points in that letter were inconsistent and
contradictory. A bortion is a very controversial topic to begin with, and needs no
added chaos by the author. H er article was confusing at best, but I shall try to
respond to it the best that I can.
R eddic states that a woman is superior to her child, but then complains that
women have to fight for equality with men. Why should the children be
subordinate? W ho will fight for their rights? If indeed women are inferior to
men, why should they have any rights. If the superiority of a woman allows here
to decide the fate of the child she bears, why should the superiority of men not
em power them to dictate to the wom en what rights they have, if any. (This is not
my view, m erely a logical outcom e of R eddic’s statem ent.)
She then states that abortion should be considered the same as euthanasia
and the death penalty. The death penalty is used for a very small num ber of
people who have com m ittee heinous acts against society. A bortion, on the other
hand, kills millions of people who have done nothing wrong, but are an
inconvenience to som eone who then decides to end the innocent’s life.
Reddic asserts that the illegalizing of abortion is about denied rights. 1 don’t

think that is the case at all. The right of the m other to do what she wants with
her body was exercised when she had sex. H er right to decide w hether she wants
to have a child stops after conception. (W hether the courts agree with this is of
no consequence. It is a m oral issue, not a legal one.) The extent of her rights
have been reached, for they now start infringing on som eone else’s rights. My
right to extend my fist ends where your nose begins.
An underlying them e in this letter is that abortion is all right because there
are other things (euthanasia, the death penalty) that are done that kill people.
Just because these other things happen does not m ean that abortion is
permissible. She then tries to excuse abortion by stating that “killing is killing”;
we all kill things, such as animals for food and bothersom e insects, so we are all
guilty of an equivalent crime to abortion. This is not true at all. Hum ans are the
most im portant species on the planet. If I had to choose betw een killing a cow
and letting a man (or wom an) die, it would not be a hard decision. As Reddic
asks at the end of her letter, contrary to what most of her letter has preached,
“whose right is it really to decide the death of another? ... I know it’s not m ine.”

letter to the editor.

M em bers of the S IU E staff need to sharpen their people skills
I am writing this letter concerning the way some
students' questions are treated at this university. I
am not criticizing everyone, because for the most
part, everyone has been very kind and helpful. I just
get frustrated when I encounter som eone who
treats my concerns and questions as though they are
insignificant, especially when I am in a com pletely
new environm ent.
Several weeks ago I w ent into the advisory office
to m ake an appointm ent to set up my classes for the
spring semester. I realize that there were only two
women working at the desk at the time, and quite a
few students had come in all at once. M any of the
students, including m yself, are new to the
procedures at SIU E. Yes, we are full of questions,
and som etimes that may be annoying, but one
wom an in that office was extrem ely rude and

im patient. She sighed and nodded her head like she
was surrounded by a pack of idiots and morons.
W hen I went back for my appointm ent, which
happened to be at 8 a.m. in the morning, I was once
again treated with disrespect and dismissed without
a second thought by this same woman. I arrived
about 10 m inutes early, which I feel is appropriate
for any type of appointm ent. This woman walked
into the office, and I thought I might come inside
and have a seat while waiting for my advisor instead
of standing in the m iddle of the hall like a fool. She,
however, had another idea. She abruptly told me
the office did not open until 8 a.m., which I was well
aware of, but I did not think my sitting in a chair
inside the office w ould hin d er an y o n e’s work
perform ance.
I had to ask myself if this woman had any kind of

letter to the editor

A1 Salvi’s claim to family values
biggest joke since Dan Quayle
This letter is in response to Charles L.
Hanfelder's Oct. 8 letter. A1 Salvi is a far cry
from representing “family values”. A simple
com parison of Mr. Salvi’s vs. Mr. D urbin’s
reco rd dem o n strates th at C ongressm an
D urbin is the tru e cham pion of people,
whereas A1 Salvi is so right-wing that h e’s got
G enghis K han rolling over in his grave
with jealousy.
O n the issue of consum er protections, state
representative A1 Salvi voted to w eaken legal
sanctions against used car dealers that sell
defective autom obiles (SB 317, 5/22/95). Dick
D urbin voted against num erous m easures that
would have limited consumers; rights. (S.429,
6/30/92), (H .R . 1022; [Roll Call 1183]), (H.R.
956; [Roll Call 1129]).
On the issue of health insurance, Salvi
voted against disclosure of patients’ rights on
doctor charges to M edicare beneficiaries and
voted against an Illinois law that would have
guaranteed health insurance coverage to all
Illinois residents. (HB 1504, 4/27/93), (HB
1459, 4/22/93). Dick Durbin voted against the
$270 billion M edicare cuts that would have
paid for $245 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy
and co rporations, and he was a strong

supporter of President C linton’s health care
plan that would have guaranteed insurance
coverage for all Americans. (H.R. 2425; [Roll
Call 1731]), (H .R . 2491, 10/26/95).
On the issue of college aid, A1 Salvi voted
against the F uture of Education Act, which
would help families save for college costs.
(H .B . 822, 4/22/93). C ongressm an D urbin
voted against reductions in the federal D irect
Loan program for college students. (H .R .
2491,11/17/95). A1 Salvi has continually
opposed fam ily policy and gun control,
w hereas Dick D urbin has supported them. (SB
377, 5/23/95), (H B 568, 4/26/95), (H R 1,
2/3/93), (H R 1025, 11/10/93).
The lists of contrasts between A1 Salvi and
R ichard D urbin goes on and on. A1 Salvi’s
record has clearly been anti-family and anti­
consumer, whereas Dick D urbin’s has been
strictly pro-family and pro-consumer. A1 Salvi’s
anti-family record speaks a lot louder that his
hot rh eto ric of claim ing to stand for
“family values!”

social or com m unication skills at all. If she is going
to continue to treat people with an exasperated
attitude, I vote that she be moved to a desk in a
private office in the back with a door so nobody
bothers her.
Naturally, everyone has questions when they
com e to a university, and every one of those
questions deserves a com plete and accurate answer
from som eone who knows what they are talking
about and does not mind sharing the inform ation. If
this is too hard for some em ployees, maybe they
should find a jo b in a different departm ent so they
do not have to deal with stu d en ts and their
troublesom e questions.

Tom Cecil, representative for C om puter

Board of Trustees approves lease rate for
house occupied by Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity
The only complaint that Little has deals with Cam pus Housing Activity Fee
(C H A F).
C H A F is what housing residents pay $7 out of their housing fees for various
special projects and recreational services.
“The only bad part about the housing is we do n ’t get CHAF. We’re not a part
of central housing, but we have to abide by Tower Lake rules. We have no wingbuilding funding,” Little said.
University Housing officers said allowing the fraternity to use Tract 31
instead of Tower Lake A partm ents has opened Tower Lake Building 524 to
house 28 freshm en and a resident assistant. Building 521, adjacent to 524,
houses 30 freshm en and a peer assistant. Four faculty/staff m entors are
assigned to the buildings to assist in the support and developm ent of the
freshm en living there.
C hancellor Nancy Belck is pleased that m ore space can be provided for
incoming students to SIUE.
“Fifty-eight freshm en can be accom m odated who otherw ise could not be
offered University Housing,” C hancellor Belck said.
The search for m ore housing began when the Residence Hall and Tower
Lake was over-subscribed for fall sem ester. C hancellor Belck said it was
estim ated that at least 150 additional students would have liked to live on
campus, if space had been available.
D irector of University Housing Michael Schultz said that no o ther building
on campus would be available for additional housing.
“No other space on campus is available— no m ore tracts,” Schultz said.
All G reek organizations had the opportunity to apply for buildings or
sections on Tower Lake for G reek housing.
“They (fraternities and sororities) were all offered sections of Tower Lake
housing last year. No one took us up on that offer except A lpha Phi Alpha
Fraternity,” Schultz said.

By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
An annual lease rate for A lpha Phi A lpha fraternity to occupy a former
residence at SIU E was approved by the SIU B oard of Trustees.
The house, known as Tract 31, located near the bicycle and pedestrian trail
between Tower Lake A partm ents and the academic campus core, was most
recently used as the Faculty Club, and is currently being occupied by 10
m em bers of the fraternity. The 12-month lease rate, including utilities, is
$29,252. The resolution approved by the board also includes a six-percent
increase in the rate for Fiscal Year 1998, to $31,007 annually. The board had
been considering the m atter since early Septem ber.
Jarrett Brooks, president of the fraternity, does have some reservations
about fiscal year 1998 pricing.
“The $29,000 price is fine because it is the same as Tower Lake housing. 1 do
have some questions about the $31,000. Divided between the m em bers living
here, th at’s an extra $200 apiece,” Brooks said.
W hen asked w hether the fraternity would question the university about the
price Brooks replied, “No doubt”.
Brooks said living in the house is going well so far with the exception of one
cable services.
“The house is fine, but we have no cable so far. They haven’t run the wires
into the house for the cable yet,” Brooks said.
James Little, student body vice president and m em ber of A lpha Phi Alpha
fraternity, feels the house is worth the price.
“I think it’s a reasonable price when you think about all the things they
(university housing) have done to update the house for us,” Little said.
Some of the updates included allowing cable services into the house.

Students take action against adult illiteracy
By Ty Norris
Lifestyle Editor
There are adults and parents of children
who struggle to read basic directions, or
even their child’s report card.
T here is nothing w rong w ith th eir
eyesight and the room they
are reading in is well lit. The
problem is th at they are
illiterate or semi-illiterate.
Illiteracy among adults is
nothing new. It has been
detected in jobs, schools, and
many businesses.
“Twenty p ercen t of the
adults
in
Illinois
are
functionally illiterate,” Susan
Frem m ing, Literacy G ran t
M onitor of the Secretary of
S tate’s Office, said. “That is
roughly one out of five,” she
added.
W ith th at in m ind, four
g rad u ate
stu d en ts
from
S IU E
w rote
a
story
addressing th e issue of
identifying low levels of
literacy am ong parents.
Susan
B ohler,
K aren
Eichenlaub, Sandra Litteken and D ebbie
Wallis form ed a group as part of a final
assignment for class.

The class was an adult literacy class and
was taught by Dr. Valerie M eyer. M eyer
told each group to write about what they
had
learned in class.
“We w ere to w rite a jo u rn al article
reflecting w hat we had learned in the class,”
Susan Bohler, a special education teacher at
K reitner E lem entary School in Collinsville,
said.
“We were all elem entary school teachers
and we w anted to hit upon an article that
showed having illiterate parents can affect
children in the classroom ,’’ D ebbie Wallis, a
first grade teach er at N iedring H ouse
School in G ranite City, said.

A ccording to Sandra Litteken, a first
grade teacher at Belle Valley School in
Belleville, it only took them two days to
com plete the assignment.
Bohler stated that with all of them being
teachcrs they had already noticed low levels
of illiteracy in their different schools.

Litteken concurred by saying, “I think
there are definitely some parents who lack
literacy skills.”
The group em barked on their endeavor
by meeting at Wallis’ home.
“We all m et at my house and it clicked,”
Wallis said. “It was an amazing thing.”
M eyer said that after reading the group’s
assignment she felt that it should receive
higher
recognition.
She
then
encouraged the group to submit the
article to a professional journal.
The group had m ixed feelings
about th eir in stru cto r’s strange
suggestion.
“W ell... I think we were all amazed
that it was journal quality. It didn’t
seem real. It still doesn’t, Bohler said.
“We felt flattered,” Wallis said.
Litteken added that she thought
th at the instructor had suggested
every group to submit their projects
to some type of publication. She was
surprised when she learned that the
instructor
had
not
suggested
everyone do so.
The Reading Teacher was the
journal that published the essay. The
journal is a peer-reviewed publication
by the International Reading Association,
and is a service to those interested in
children’s literacy learning. It is read by
65,000 individuals and institutions in 100
countries.
In the article, the group outlined some

examples of what happens when a child’s
parent(s) maintains a low-literacy level and
gives indicators on how to detect possible
signs of low-literacy or illiterate parents.
O ne indicator cited in the article, is if a
parent(s) appears to lack interest in their
child’s progress they may be dealing with
the problem of low literacy or
illiteracy. For example, if a child
does not return special-activity
permission slips (e.g. field trips)
it could be an indication that
the parent has a low level of
literacy. Teachers should also
question if defensive behaviors
arise in the parents concerning
their child’s performance.
If the parent phones the
school constantly and poses
questions that may have been
addressed in letters sent to the
hom e, it could be another
indication of low level literacy,
the article stated.
The teachers are also taking
an active role in helping to
reduce the low level of literacy
am ong parents.
“We
have
an
A t-R isk
program for children and their
parents to learn.,” Littekin said. “The child
benefits by becoming a better reader and
the parent learns skills they don’t have
because of a lack of education,” she added.
B ohler said,”We are currently working
on a grant th at will help increase the
skills of parents.”
The article urged teachers to use simpler

words when communicating with parents
and concluded by offering ways to support
low-literate parents.
E d ito r’s note: G roup member, Karen
Eichenlaub could not be reached fo r
comment.

A night o f shared sweets comes to m y mind;
the hot, heavy heat shows on closed blinds.
Moans and groans come from beneath the covers
as two become friends and lovers.
We'd lost control to our appetite

Caponera brings 'record' laughs to St. Louis
By Corey Stulce
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
This weekend marks the one
year anniversary for Laugh Tracks
comedy club in Union Station, and
comedian John Caponera will be
headlining the festivities.
Caponera
was
the
first
comedian to appear at the club last
year, and he has chosen St. Louis
as the city to record his first-ever
comedy album. “St. Louis is a
good-city for me, since I’m from
Chicago. They have pretty much
the same sensibilities,” said
Caponera.
He has been performing standup comedy for over 17 years, and
he has decided to start going in a
new direction: acting. He had a
sitcom on NBC two years ago

called “The Good Life.”
“It was a great show.
Unfortunately, at the time, NBC
was in dire straits. We were put on
a night with all new shows. We had
no recognizable lead-in show.
Everyone was thrown to the
wolves,” said Caponera.
The cancellation hasn’t kept
him down, though. He is pursuing
other
acting
projects,
but
auditioning is difficult when he is
on the road. “Stand up comedy is
my bread and butter, so I’ll never
totally alienate it, but I’m ready for
a new direction,” Caponera said.
Being on the road also makes it
hard to be a family man, Caponera
said. He has an 11-month-old son
who will be celebrating a
Birthday/Halloween party next
week.

Comedian John Caponera

Caponera’s approach to his
comedy is simple, he wants the
audience to sit back and enjoy. “I
have a show to put on,” Caponera
said. “Sometimes I like to try out
new stuff on the road, because

what have I got to lose? Nobody
in the audience is gonna make me
or break me.”
He has a new bit about
M adonna’s baby he will most
likely be testing on the audiences
in St. Louis. According to him, it’s
been killing the audiences.
“I’m wondering, when the baby
was going through the birth canal
if she was thinking, ‘Man, if these
walls could talk. I mean, the
plethora of penises that have
passed this way. If I get poked in
the head one more time...,” joked
Caponera.
Audience members will have a
chance to have their laughs
recorded on Friday and Saturday
night when Caponera treats the
audience to his musings on life at
Laugh Tracks.

Cougars
win one
at home
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E volleyball team cruised
past Illinois-Springfield on Tuesday
night at the V adalabene Center.
The Cougars stepped their record
up to 17-11 with a 15-6,15-8,10-15,1614 victory.
“We played everyone everyw here” ,
head coach Sandy M ontgom ery said
W ednesday afternoon.
Julie L itteken had 17 kills with a
.571 hitting percentage in the four set
win.
C hristy S h eller's stress fracture
kept her out of another game as Kim
G ilm an filled in as setter.
“W e’re saving Christy for the big­
ger games th at we have coming u p ”,
M ontgom ery said. “She’ll be in the
line-up this w eekend.”
The Cougars will go on the road to
play Quincy on Friday and U M SL on
Saturday.
“T hese are two big conference
gam es for u s”, M ontgom ery said.
“Quincy is a scrappy team . It’s tough
to play in their building. They will be
up for us because of the rivalry our
schools have.”
S IU E ’s foe on Saturday is No. 2 in
the G re en D ivision of the G re at
Lakes Valley Conference.
“U M S L has a strong lin e-u p ”,
M ontgom ery said. “This m atch-up
w on’t be easy for us.”
SIU E is in second place in the Blue
Division of the GLVC with a 8-2
record behind IU PU -Ft. Wayne with
eight contests left, including one on
the road against IU PU -Ft. Wayne.

The Cougars get past the first round of the GLVC tournament Wednesday night with a 2-1 victory over Quincy.

Soccer holds off Quincy 2-1
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
The SIU E w om en’s soccer game
W ednesday night against Quincy told
a tale of two halves.
The first being brilliant and keep­
ing the opposition from passing mid­
field. A nd helping the Cougars go
into halftim e with a 1-0 lead.
In the second half, the Cougars
concentration level seem ed to have
stayed in the locker room.
“It looked like we expected them
to just roll over and they didn’t. Why
should they, they have nothing to
lose,” head coach Brian K orbesm eyer
said after the game.
The 2nd ranked Cougars did hold
on to beat the 8th ranked Hawks 2-1,
but K orbesm eyer knows they have to
m ake better decisions if they want to

go any further in the GLVC to u rn a­
ment.
“We got into a lack of concentrational style but I’m probably m ore
concerned with the lack of listening
and getting out of our game plan in
the last five minutes,” Korbesm eyer
said.
The Cougars struck first in the
gam e w hen senior Stacy B undren
knocked the ball in after sophom ore
Janece Friederich hit a hard shot that
the Hawks goalie couldn’t hold on to.
B undren was right there for the put
in.
The Hawks were the next to score
on a freekick by Ashley Kreis from 25
yards out with 15 m inutes into the
half.
The Cougars retaliated with the
final goal of the game with 20 m inutes
left to play.

The final goal was by B undren, her
second of the night, with an assist by
sophom ore Karin Tighe.
It m ay not have been the prettiest
game the Cougars played, but it did
give them a team record in victories.
The Cougars won their 14th game
of the year and th at is the most ever
by an SIU E w om en’s soccer team.
This y ear’s team is 14-2-2 and had a 71-1 record in the GLVC.
“This is a great achievem ent and
th a t’s w hat I ’m going to tell the
players when we are preparing for the
game Saturday,’’K orbesm eyer said.
The Cougars will either get to play
3rd ranked UM SL or 6th ranked
Bellarmine. A t press time these two
team s w ere tied in overtime.
“ No m a tte r who we play,”
K orbesm eyer said. “It’s going to be a
tough game.”

Cougars need final games to have shot at playoffs
Conference rival UMSL and nationally ranked Truman St. are big up-coming games for the SIU E soccer
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor

The Cougars are trying to win final games in order to
make it intothe post season.

G am es against conference rival Missouri-St.
Louis and nationally ranked Truman St. are must
wins for the SIU E M en’s Soccer team , who are in
pursuit of a playoff birth.
The Cougars will visit G reat Lakes Valley
Conference foe UM SL today in a game that
should show similar styles of play going head-tohead.
“O ur playing style is very similar to that of
Missouri-St. Louis”, head coach Ed H uneke said
yesterday morning. “O ur players know most of
their players, so it creates personal rivalries.”
SIU E is currently 6-1-1 in the conference and
sits in second place behind Lewis. UM SL is in
sixth place with a 4-3-1 conference record.
“We need conference victories” , H uneke said.
“UM SL is a good team , but has had scoring p ro b ­
lems as of late. If we can get our offense going, our

defense should be able to stop them .”
On Sunday, the Cougars return hom e to face
No. 16-ranked Trum an St.
“This is a very im portant game in our fight to
m ake the p lay o ff’, H uneke said.
Trum an St. is ranked 4th in the region and were
national finalists last year.
“We have to minimize our m istakes”, H uneke
said. “If we get o u r offense clicking, we’ll do well.”
With four regular season games remaining,
SIU E has an overall record of 10-3-1.
“W e’re fortunate this late in the season to still
be in the playoff huny”, H uneke said.

In other SIUE news, WSIE is looking to hire a
play-by-play and color announcer for the up-coming basketball games.
In the next couple of weeks there will be try­
outs for the positions. If anybody is interested
contact Frank Akers, head of W SIE, at 692-2228
befo re O ct 31. A kers is located in the
C om m unications Building, room 141.
