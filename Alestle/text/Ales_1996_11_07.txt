Ready or not, President Clinton has been re-elected for four more years. Beating out
Senator Bob Dole and Texas billionaire Ross Perot, Clinton won with approximately 49
percent of the popular vote. In the Electoral College vote the figures were more lopsided,
with Clinton winning 361 to 113 for Dole. Perot received no electoral votes.
Republicans, on the other hand, made sure that Democrats did not ride the “coat-tails”
of President Clinton, and kept control of the House and Senate.
Precinct 21 voters overwhelmingly re-elected incumbent Bill Clinton Tuesday, with
almost 5 votes cast for Clinton for every one vote for Bob Dole.
Figures from the Madison County Clerk’s office show the percentage of actual voters in
this election was 77.7 percent of 431 registered voters — or 335 voters.
Precinct 21 includes residents of Tower Lake Apartments, the Residence Hall and 25
families living close to the campus.
The 1992 general election had 203 ballots cast of 268 registered voters, or 76 percent.
The Clinton/Gore ticket received 246 votes compared to Dole/Kemp’s 57 and
Perot/Choate’s 23. Straight Democratic tickets came in at 175, 27 straight Republican

Schneiders’ waiting for trial date
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
Christie Schneider, her dad, Paul, and Dennis Butkovich have been formally
charged with theft over $300. At a hearing Oct. 25, the Schneiders, along with
Butkovich, were assigned a judge in the Madison County court system.
Currently, Judge Romani will hear Butkovich’s case.
It’s unclear who will hear the Schneiders’ case, although it will most likely be
Romani as well. The Schneiders and Butkovich should receive a court date for
trial within a week.
The Schneiders and Butkovich were trying to have theft charges dropped.
The charges stemmed from an alleged attempted theft from Alpha Phi’s housing
account. The Schneiders claim they had authorization to purchase the house for
the sorority. Alpha Phi claims they didn’t.
State prosecuting attorney John McGuire commented on the upcoming case
in a telephone conversation from his office Monday afternoon.
“They were charged with theft over $300. As of yesterday, neither had any
commitments on representations of lawyers,” McGuire said.
Paul Schneider explained what took place at the Madison County
Courthouse.
“I explained to him (Judge Hackett) I was filing a motion to dismiss the
indictment. I would include all the documents, along with affidavits to motion,”
Paul Schneider said. “I told him the documents proved no theft in the case. I
told the prosecutor, the deprivation of the Alpha Phi account was caused by
Landmark Realty’s illegal conduct.”
McGuire said he can see evidence that supports a strong case for the state.

McGuire also said that he has not been contacted by any representative from
Alpha Phi. He said the sorority is working more closely with Edwardsville
Police Detective Scott Evers.
Evers could not go into detail about the case due to police policy. He did,
however, comment on certain aspects of the case.
“Right now I don’t have much to say until the trial starts. My job is pretty
much completed until trial, if necessary. It’s up to Mr. McGuire if he needs
something else from me,” Evers said. He is currently awaiting subpoenas for
everyone involved in the case.
Ruth Jones, of Landmark Realty, declined to comment on the Schneider case
and said, “I have no comment. I’m sure talking with him (Paul Schneider), he’s
a wonderful person,” Jones said.
Paul Schneider said that he will represent himself in court.
“I wanted to represent myself. I’ve had bad experiences with attorneys,”
Paul Schneider said.
P a u l S c h n e id e r a lso sa id he r e c e iv e d a n a s ty m e ssa g e fro m
A lp h a P hi I n te r n a tio n a l.
“The vice president of finance left a nasty message on my answering machine
saying that International would not issue a letter saying that it granted
authorization for the house,” he said.
Schneider said that someone of Alpha Phi International had said that the
m atter of the house had been settled. The Alestle contacted Alpha Phi
International, however, they did not return our phone call.
Daughter Christie Schneider is trying to cope with her classes and a
long semester.

“It ceFtainly appears to me that this is a strong case,” M cGuire said.

Man guilty in murder of judge by
mail bomb
AP — A man responsible for mail
bombings that raised racial tension
across the South in 1989 was convicted Tuesday for an explosion that
killed a federal judge and wounded his wife. The jury recommended
the electric chair.
Walter Leroy Moody, 51, was found guilty in Birmingham, Ala., of
murder and assault in an attack on Judge Robert Vance of the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Vance died when he opened a package
in his kitchen in suburban Mountain Brook.

Flood caused by volcano destroys two bridges in Iceland
AP — Volcanic eruptions melted the cap of Vatnajokull glacier on
Tuesday, unleashing floodwater that swept away the 1,233-foot-long
Gigja Bridge and another 164-foot bridge along the country’s southern
coast. The flooding happened in a remote area 185 miles east of
Reykjavik and no people or homes were threatened.

water gathered in a crater beneath the 2,000-foot-thick glacier. Under
pressure from the water, the ice cap on top of the glacier finally
cracked Tuesday, unleashing millions of gallons of water into the
surrounding countryside.

MTV voter drive fails to register college students
POST-DISPATCH — Nearly 400 college students from
Washington University thought they’d registered in March
when an MTV “Rock the Vote” bus arrived on campus. But
dozens were turned away from polls Tuesday when no record
of their registration could be found.
Some students grew concerned when they failed to receive
confirmation in the mail and re-registered, but many did not.
Election officials at Wydown Middle School in Clayton told
students to fill out affidavits swearing they lived here but it
didn’t help. An MTV spokeswoman in Los Angeles said she
didn’t know whether students in other cities had trouble
voting. Election officials will investigate to see if anything
can be done, elections director Leslye Winslow said.
Mother dies saving baby
BELLEVILLE NEWS-DEMOCRAT — Firefighters are
hailing as a hero a 19-year-old mother who lost her life in a
house fire Monday trying to save her infant son’s life. Carla
Jacobs, formerly of St. Peters, Mo., died of smoke inhalation
as she shielded her 1-month-old son, Dylan Harris,
underneath her in a bathtub filled with cold water. Fire from
a space heater ignited bedding in a bedroom where Jacobs,
her son and boyfriend Daverick Harris, 23, were sleeping.

Letter to the editor------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take a walk and slow down,
before life passes you by
I fell down the stairs the other day. I was in a hurry and slipped on the last few steps.
Physically I am fine, but I think the trip jarred something in my mind. Maybe if 1 had not been
in such a hurry, I would not have fallen. Anyway, I picked myself up off the ground and
proceeded out the door. The cool fall air hit me as I walked outside.
Walking toward my car, I noticed that many leaves have changed to beautiful shades of
orange and yellow. The sun is also beginning to set much earlier than before. I am aware that
these are the marks of the typical progression of seasons; however, 1 failed to notice that the
changes occurred.
I have been rushing around for months now. Maybe falling was a sign for me to slow down
and pay attention to the world around me. I missed summer—I do not want to miss fall. In this
culture, we always seem to be on the go. We have been raised to rush off to work, school,
meetings, or practice. I do not remember the last time I took a leisurely walk. Many of us never
take the time in our day to sit back and soak in the colors, air, and beauty surrounding us. When
did we all get in such a hurry? I am still young, but my days are passing too. I do not often know
where all my time goes.
We are told to stop and smell the flowers, but how many of us really do? Now it is too late—
at least until next year. We all need to move out of the express lane of life. Somewhere in this
busy world, life got lost or buried under a pile of paperwork. Look outside—this season is
really beautiful. Drive through SIU sometime and you will see what I mean.
Separating the parking lots from the buildings, a patch of grass and trees interrupt our busy
lives. In that area lies true life. I know—I walked through it after my fall. Though slightly
bruised, I am glad I fell. Otherwise, I may have missed this season too.

letter to the editor

Domestic violence affects everyone—not just women
There is no doubt that violence in America
is a serious problem. The problem is not being
rationally addressed, however, by Ms.
H uebner’s (Alestle, Oct 16, p.l ff) male
bashing. I wonder is she is familiar with the
studies of Gelles and Straus showing that
women are just as likely to engage in violence
as men and that siblings are the most violent of
all? They also state, “women assault their
partners at about the same rate as men assault
their partners. This applies to both minor and
severe assaults” (Physical Violence In

American Families, 1990, p 162). Furthermore,
“It turns out that lesbians may be battering
each other at the same rate as heterosexuals”
(Sommers, 1994, p 199). So there seems to be
quite a bit of battering going around, but
verbally battering men and engendering a
paranoid psychology among women can only
lead to greater division and distrust. We should
all work together to reduce violence in this
country and make it “rarer than apple pie.”

A word from Student Government
Here are some highlights from the last Student Government meeting:
>
• Mike Ostrander presented information to the Student Senate on behalf of Campus
Recreation, demonstrating increased attendance and participation at the new Student
Fitness Center.
• The Senate approved student travel requests for members of the International Student
Council.
• Program requests for Delta Sigma Theta, Black Student Association and African Student
Association were also approved.
A Student Government meeting is scheduled for Nov. 8 at 1:30 p.m. to assign senators to
review fiscal year 1999 fee reports.
Senators will be assigned in groups to review the FY 99 reports and make recommendations
to the administration concerning whether to increase, decrease or leave student fees at
established rates.
The Constitution & Review Committee approved the allocation of locker and office space
for student organizations.
The University late night dance policy is still under review by students and staff. A key issue
is the use of card readers to insure that those who attend University dances are exclusively
SIUE students and their guests.

letter to the editor

Student seeking answers on
parking situation on campus
I’m writing this letter
concerning
the
parking
situation at SIUE. I am
confused and concerned
about many of the policies
and regulations dealing with
parking. A few of the things
that are a concern to me are,
first, the school asks us to pay
$40 for a parking pass, to only
then ask us to walk what
many, including myself, think
is a long distance. The school
assigns us to the lots we are
permitted to park on and then
sites us a $8 to $15 citation if
we park in a handicapped
parking spot or in a no
parking zone, but receiving a
citation because one parks
close to school in a lot
unassigned to them, I find
hard to comprehend.
The second concern I have
is, who decides who gets to
park where? Why is the
majority of students having to
park in the red zones 100 to
200 yards away from the
school when others get the
opportunity to park in the
green and black zones right
next to the school? It’s not so
much that I mind the walk, it’s
more the fact that I paid to go
to school here and then paid
to park, only to find out I had
to walk a good distance to get
to any of my classes.
The third concern I have is
about the men and women
who give out citations. I have
heard many stories about how
people have unjustly received
citations and not being able to
do anything about it except to
pay
for
it.
To
my
understanding there is an
L e tte rs to th e e d ito r
policy:
P lease su b m it le tte rs
ty p e w ritte n in 500 w ords
o r less. P lease in clu d e
p h o n e n u m b e r an d

appeal system you can choose
to go through if you feel you
have been done unjustly but,
you still have to pay for your
citation first. I also understand
that these people are doing
their job, but to wait for the
parking meters to expire so
they can give out a citation
seems
to
be
on
the
extreme side.
I also understand that one
of the school’s revenue is
parking and parking citations,
but
the
school
must
understand
that
many
students don’t work and can’t
afford to be paying for things
such as parking tickets. I
believe that everything has a
purpose so I’m sure that there
are
reasons
for
every
regulation. I believe there are
ways to accommodate all
parties involved. By asking
the opinion of students and
faculty regarding parking, the
school might find other ways
to deal with the problem.
When the opinions are
obtained then the regulations
can be reevaluated to fit the
needs of all parties involved.
The school may also
consider doing an incentive
program. The higher your
grades are the cheaper it is to
park, and the closer you get to
park to school. If students are
truly tired of making the walk
and paying the prices the
grades will come up, and in
the long run will make the
school look better than it
already does.

Expert on terrorism speaks at SIUE

from front page

By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
The face of war and its solutions are
changing. T hat’s the message Max Manwaring
brought to the second annual Southern Illinois
International Studies Alliance (SIISA)
program. Manwaring spoke to two dozen
people in the Hickory Room on Monday.
The SIISA is a 14-member consortium of
Southern Illinois higher education institutions
organized to promote international studies,
expanded global knowledge and education.
M anwaring said it was time for
international studies, history and political
science students to demand, and faculty to
propose, courses that dealt with what he called
“gray area phenom enon” (GAP).
“GA P involves a change from a cold war
m entality to what I call a ‘New World
D isorder’. We should no longer be worried
about a Russian invasion, but guerrilla
insurgency,” Manwaring said.
M anw aring is a- re tire d colonel in the
A rm y who was a research analyst w ith the
D e fe n se Intelligence Agency. He is an
adjunct professor of political science at
Dickenson College, in Pennsylvania and a

political-military affairs consultant.
Manwaring said that by conservative count
there are 60 wars going on today.
“In our desire to show progress, we call
them by different names, like ‘invisible war,’ or
a ‘teapot’ for a tempest in a teapot,” Manwaring said.
These conflicts, he said, can involve the
flow of refugees from war-torn countries and
gangs, warlords and organized crime leaders
who often act with impunity. These problems
pose a trans-national threat because they
move from one country to another. He added
they are not wars in the strictest sense, but
involve economic and social factors as well.
The solution to these problems, Manwaring
said, is serious national cooperation.
“It will take the world community to bring
world order to countries. Boutras BoutrasGhali said it has to come from all of us, which
means giving up some of our own sovereignty
and rethinking what power m eans,”
Manwaring said.
Manwaring said power once meant just
military strength but now should include
political, economic and social stability.
“We need to take a holistic approach like
the Brazilians do and build the country, not the
military,” he said.

Bradford’s 218 votes to Garcia’s 83.
Complete figures for the state were not
available from the County Clerk’s office for
comparison purposes.

“I ’ve missed a lot of classes. They had me meeting with
psychiatrists and counselors on campus,” she said.
Schneider gave an example of how people on campus
have been treating her.
“One day, a group of 20 people in the UC came up to me
and said, ‘Hey, can we have some of that money?’ Then I
realized that they were talking to me. Granted it was a joke,
I was the butt of the joke. I have to defend myself everyday
from people asking me questions in class. I’m just trying to
make it to the rest of the semester.,” Schneider said.
Schneider said she has been “emotionally down,” and
counselors have been trying to help her get through all the
allegations she is currently facing.

For the second time in less than a week, a sorority on campus is sponsoring an awareness
project on a disease. The members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority will conduct a forum on
Sickle Cell anemia today at 7 p.m. in the International Room of the University Center.
Sickle-cell anemia is a disease characterized by an abnormal red blood cell containing a
defective form of hemoglobin that causes the cell to become sickle-shaped when deprived of
oxygen. The disease typically strikes people of African-American descent.
Tamika Mason, member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, said that awareness about the disease is important.
“Basically, sickle-cell anemia is the largest African-American genetic disease. We wanted
to focus on it because it’s something that hits close to home. Some sorors (members) have
the sickle-cell trait,” Mason said.
The speaker, S tephanie H udson, is with the Sickle-Cell A nem ia F oundation of
G re a te r St. Louis.
A long with the forum , the so rority will d o n ate half of their earnings from an
upcom ing dance to the fo u ndation. The dance will be held this Friday at the
C ougar D en, U niversity C enter.
The sorority also sponsored their annual B uckle Up for Safety D rive on Tuesday
at the in tersectio n of Tow er Lake R oad and N orth U niversity D rive. M em bers had
a m essage to give to drivers.
“In car accidents, a lot of people die who do not use their seat-belts so we try to make
people aware. We gave lifesavers to all those who were wearing their seat belts, and DumDums for those who didn’t wear their seat belts,” Latongia Hayes, another member of
Alpha Kappa Alpha, said.
With two organizations holding forums on prevalent diseases this week, Mason believes
other organizations can work together in the future.
“We hadn’t talked about it yet, but it is a thought to look into,” Mason said.
The members of Delta Sigma Theta held a forum Wednesday on diabetes.
The forum on sickle cell anem ia is the so ro rity ’s first, the buckle up for safety is
the so ro rity ’s third.

Wine class

T h e

A l e s i l e

good to the last drop

By Ty Norris
Lifestyle Editor

Have you ever been out dining and wanted a good glass of
wine, but you were unsure of what type of wine to order?
Wonder no more.
Dino’s is offering wine-tasting classes to all wine drinkers
and beginning wine drinkers. The classes will consist of
tasting wines, discussing their characteristics, and learning
about the grapes used to make wines and the region they are
from. Most importantly, though, the classes will teach wine
drinkers how to enjoy wine in an affordable and casual way.
According to the U.S. Agricultural Department, drinking
a glass of wine with your meal (in moderation) has. many
health benefits.
Tom Nicholson, wine buyer for Dino’s , will be the
instructor of the classes. He has worked for wineries in Napa
Valley (Beringer and Heiz Cellars), Oregon (Elk Cove),
Virginia (Oasis), and Missouri (Mount Pleasant) and he has
also conducted a similar wine tasting class at Indiana
University.
The classes are also designed to convey a message that
drinking wine is not harmful when done in moderation and
that being a wine taster could be a good hobby.
Wine is not just a drink, it is a part of everyday life.
“Wine is history, agriculture, business and healthy (in
moderation),” Nicholson said.
“The earth can speak through the wine,” said Nicholson
“When you drink a glass of French wine, you may eventually
be able to tell the year it was made in and what type of grape
it was made from,” he added.
The classes are encouraging students, faculty and staff to
not shy away, but learn about enjoying some good wine, with
good times, in an affordable manner. This will also give you a
jump start for the upcoming holiday seasons!
The wine selections will range from the least expensive to
the best. According to Nicholson how well a wine tastes and
how expensive it, is determined by the region it is grown in
and the type of grape that is used.
“Location, location, location,” Nicholson stressed.
Certain ground, or certain soil is better for growing grapes,
he added.
Some of the wines that will be tasted are French and
California Chardonnay, German Rieslings, French and
California Merlots, and Australian wines.
The classes will be held in Edwardsville at the Downtown
Deli and a five dollar discount of the fee of the classes is
available to all students, faculty, and staff.

The power of

The tongue is a powerful
tool. We use it to eat, order
things, or give directions.
I have wondered why
some people can curse
som eone out, or tell
someone off, but can barely
speak to someone they see
in the passing, or sit next to
on a bus?
In my 23 years in this
world I have noticed this
and it bothers me.
Why can’t we use our
tongue to edify, or exhort
someone? How hard is it to
say, “Hi. How are you?”
Now, I know some of you
have an image to uphold, so
you are allowed to use
“what’s up?”
It is interesting to me,
though, how this seemingly
insignificant member of our
body can be so damaging.

W oodblock Prints: reflections of the post
By Angela Jinks
Lifestyle Reporter
The Wagner Art Gallery is presenting
a show of Contem porary Woodblock
Prints by Chinese artist Yingxue Zuo.
Zuo is an instructor at Webster
University in St. Louis and a graphic
artist for the Southwestern Bell Yellow
Pages. Zuo was born in China and grew
up during the cultural revolution.
According to friend Bob Malone, head
of the print making area at SIUE, the
cultural revolution “was a traum atic
experience for everyone.” Zuo endured
many hardships during this time in
history. He came from a family of
intellectuals and they proved to be on the
“wrong side” according to the new
communist government. Zuo’s father was
murdered by communists when Zuo was
only five years old.
During the cultural revolution, all of
China’s universities were closed for ten
years. Zuo was not able to go to college
until he was 24 years old. In 1984, Zuo
came to the United States and attended
Southern
Illinois
University
at
Carbondale and worked on his master’s
in fine arts.
In China Zuo had been painting
landscapes of Northern China where he
lived. Coal mining is vety important in

that area of the world and the landscape
tends to be very bleak and ugly. Zuo was
able to capture the feeling of the land.
“The paintings are wonderful, but they
are about a very unwonderful part of the
world,” Malone said.
Upon his arrival in Carbondale, Zuo
became frustrated with the “clean, neat,
and smooth” landscape.
He began making prints with
woodblocks. All of Z uo’s prints are done
in black and white, with plywood, and are
made by hand. Most of them are large,
averaging eight feet by eight feet.
Malone believes Zuo is “currently
dead set on doing black and white prints
by hand.”
Zuo feels he gets more control over
the results o{, the art when doing the
printing by hand. He is able to adjust the
tones of the black and white in a way he
would not be able to do with a regular
printing press. Most of the prints reflect
on the two cultures to which he has
belonged in his lifetime.
“[His] current pieces reflect on his
past,” states Malone.
Zuo and M alone are currently
discussing the possibility of editing a
book about Am erican Printm aking

Club ice
hockey to
begin year
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E Ice Hockey
Club team starts its inaugural
season on the road this
Saturday
against
the
University
of
IllinoisDanville.
U of I-Danville is expected
to be the toughest team on
the Cougar’s schedule, but
S IU E ’s head coach, Bill
Misiak, is optim istic about
how his team will fair this
weekend.
“We should do well against
Danville,” Misiak said. “We
have a wide variety of talent
on this team.”
The Cougars will be a part
of the Illinois/Wisconsin
Collegiate
Hockey
Association. SIU E’s schedule
includes the likes of Bradley,
M issouri-Columbia and St.
Louis University.
The first home game for
SIUE will be on December 21
at the East Alton Ice Arena
against Missouri-Columbia.
“I’m interested to see how
we do this season,” Misiak
said. “It should be something
new and exciting for the uni­
versity.”
Misiak has spent the past
six years developing the youth
hockey program in Illinois.
He is a former Detroit Junior
Red Wing and works as a
Training and Organizational
D evelopm ent Specialist on
campus. He will not only be
the coach for the new club
team , but also the team ’s
trainer.
Misiak started to organize
the team in early April to let
area players come to a local
university and still be able to
play college hockey.
“I wanted local high school
graduates that aren’t chosen
for Division I or Division II
teams to still be able to play
the game.”
In other SIUE news.
Jason Holmes of the SIUE
m en’s basketball team was
selected has an honorable
m ention for the NCAA
Division II M en’s Basketball
Preseason All-Americans in
both the Division II Bulletin
and
the
Blue
Ribbon
Yearbook.
Holmes led SIUE last year
averaging 18.2 points a con­
test.
He also shot 86.4 percent
from the free throw line.

Cougars head into post-season
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
Throughout the entire year, the SIUE
women’s soccer team has been playing
solid and from that they have broken
many personal, as well as team records.
The one thing that can top off this
great year can only be the NCAA
Championships.
Monday afternoon the Cougars got
word that they received a bid to the elite
12-team
NCAA
Division
II
Championships.
It’s the second trip for the Cougars to
the Championships as they made the cut
in 1993.
Seniors Stephanie Kult, Joan Wacker
and Stacy Bundren were all freshmen on
the 1993 team .
The Cougars will have the chance to
avenge a 3-1 loss earlier in the year to St.
Joseph’s who finished the year 21-1-1.
“They have eight seniors, so they are a
solid team. They understand what they
have to do,” head coach Brian
Scott Anderson/A/esf/e
Korbesmeyer said. “O ur enthusiasm The SIUE women's soccer team will play at St. Joseph's College Sunday afternoon.

By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
The SIUE women’s tennis team received
good news for a change this year as fresh­
man Sarah Hardimon was voted to the 1996
All-Great Lakes Valley Conference team.
Last year the Cougars won the GLVC
with a 11-0 record. Minor set backs like
grades and NCAA clearance problems kept
the team down all year.
During this year, Hardimon played No. 1
singles for the Cougars and compiled a 11-2

record.
Hardimon also made it to the quarterfi
nals of the M id-American Role?
Championships where she was seeded 11th
All year Sarah has been the most consis
tent on the entire team. The team finishec
eighth in the conference.
“She has worked really hard all fall ant
having a great season as well as playinj
exceptionally well at the Rolex. I believ<
she established herself as one of the toj
players in the conference and the region,’
head coach Bill Logan said.
