Currently hanging at the R.

drawings and paintings of
Jane
Barrow,
showcasing
rem arkable atm osphere and
intense textures.
Barrow is one o f two
painting instructors teaching at
SIUE who, very knowingly,
funnels
modi
classroom
experim entation tow ards the
pursuit
o f Realism.
Her
independently
professional
expression, however, is deeper
than realism, ifer inspirations
are often photqs or still lifes.
Long, sinewy, vines swim
throughout
her
design
repeatedly
apd
are
the
param ount from
for her
incredible “suifface activity.”
She declares this formal
realism to be beyond (yet built
by) years of straight realism.
Barrow began with an
image. She ¡then painted,
printed and drew many views
many tim es. The resulting
compositions snow much linear
texture, spatial aptitude and
continuity of ijnovement. Her

d is p la y

torn pieces, divided canvases
and fractured and assembled
viewpoints meld together into
an amazingly fluid atmospheric
observation.
Some of her work toys

shadow
involving movement and space.
Seen again are the organic
vines which blow about,
depicted in several different
color schemes. Linear, precise
brushwork is extremely evident
in the soft, controlled spread of
the oil paints.
Barrow’s confidence and
professionalism is evident in
her daily demeanor. Now her
students and colleagues can
view her personal expression
honed by her everyday training,
practice and interaction. One
elem ent Barrow hopes to
express to her students is the
true personal excitement gained
from professional presentation.
The professional gallery is a
showcase for creation and a
rewarding endeavor in which
she takes pride.

Tainted turkey: Thanksgiving here won’t be the same overseas
We are going home
for Thanksgiving and
we are glad. We smile
with relief that a
semester is almost over
with and we have this
Daniella
Belton nice weeklong break to
relax and prepare for
finals and.those end-of-semester
projects. We are happy because
we are tired of college. We are
tired of the endless studying and
the bottomless pit filled with pastdue assignments and timeconsuming projects.
J3ut there are some people out
in the world who wish they were
in our school-loathing shoes.
Many of us hardly know
what’s going on with our next
door neighbors, let alone what’s
going on in a country on the other
side of the world. But we are able
to
attend
college
without
persecution and without inquiry.
The members of the Baha’i faith
in Iran don’t get that option.
Right now, students of the
Baha’i minority in Iran are being
jailed for their religious beliefs
and denied the right to attend the
country’s
colleges
and
universities. After starting their
own university, the government

shut the institution down after
raiding the building and arresting
students and teachers.
In Honduras the entire
country has been ravished by
Hurricane Mitch, leaving majority
of the country homeless and in
despair. There will be no students
complaining about tests at their
universities for a long time as their
country struggles to rebuild.
After columns criticizing our
country, our media and our
campus' lack of activism, it’s easy
to see why Americans today aren’t
riled up in protest. We have it
made. We live in the most
powerful and wealthy country in
the world. We have laws that
allow all citizens the right to an
education. If we don’t like our
leaders we can vote them out. We
have vast resources and funds that
can rebuild parts of our country
ravished by natural disasters. Our
country is like an island. We are
untouched by war and famine We
can have a revolution through
quiet
legislation
and
no
bloodshed. We can buy and build
our way out of anything. But our
country learned long ago that we
cannot live as an island. We are an
integral part of the international

community, and as a world leader,
we have a responsibility to others.
We have so much, why can we not
give time and effort, to world
causes?
Right now, we are once again
about to bomb Iraq and already
have sanctions against it because
we don’t like the leader. We don’t
seem to consider the people
Saddam Hussein oppresses and
the harm done to them by the
sanctions. Never mind that as long
as Saddam can feed himself and

Consider how lucky you are to be
here. For all the things we dislike
about this country and alT the
poverty and injustices that do
occur, let us rem em ber this
Thanksgiving just how truly lucky
we are. Let us also pray and help
others less fortunate. It is our
shared guilt and-our duty.

his army, the people of Iraq will
never be rid of him. Never mind
that there are injustices and crimes
going on all over the world and the
only thing we care about is the guy
sitting on all the oil. Who cares if
just next door in Iran people are
being oppressed and the media
doesn’t report it, the United States
doesn’t interfere and we students
are
too
preoccupied
with
ourselves to even notice.
Therefore, think about this
while you are on your break.

SINCINC, YODELING AND OTHER
THINGS...YÜO PICK THE TRACK
BY LUKE SMITH
COPY EDITOR
There’s music to sing to, music to dance to, music to study to and
music to make love to. And then there’s Martin Sexton.
Near as one can tell, Sexton’s music is for listening to while you’re
sitting on the back porch with an old dog and a banjo. It’s like when your
uncle pulls out the guitar at a family reunion and just starts singing because
it’s either that or listen to your grandma.
Sexton pulls together mountain music, soul, jazz and, for some reason,
lounge music. He combines the sounds of old-school country and blues.
He’s like a half-asleep, country-fried John Mellencamp, only with a
disturbing dash of Tiny Tim’s terrifying falsetto.
What people will take away from “The American,” Sexton’s recent
Atlantic release, will depend upon what track they listen to. Throughout the
album, there’s a diversity of styles, some of which work much better than
others. From the “Rambling Man” style of the title track to the upbeat
hoedown of “Station Man' and even to the disc’s low point, a sickly tu n e .
called “Love Keep Us Together,” which sounds like an ’80s lounge singer
covering Prince, there’s something to like in* each track. Unfortunately,
however, there’s usually something to dislike as well.
Each tune spins its own particular web of moodiness, usually bringing
up pictures of a corroding Southwest, well past its days of glamour and
adventure, or a California knee-deep in its own malaise. With deft
instrumental work, Sexton conjures up some powerful images, but
unfortunately his lyrics, with notable exceptions, tend toward the cliched
(“She loves me like a dog loves a bone”), the bizarre (“You’ll be who you

STICKMAN

want, I’ll be who you want, I’ll
be your Ray Liotta”) and the
scary (“Hey, little jailbait, tell
me a story” sung in a deep,
gravelly pedophile voice). And
then the yodeling begins.
There are times when the
writing, the music and the
moods come together to create
a real moment - most notab'y
in “My Maria," a very touching
coming-of-age
love
song
framed
by
the
Catholic
experience, “Maria” is easily
the high point of the album, but
even it teeters precariously on
the cusp of the great abyss
that is Michael Bolton.
Sexton’s sincerity as a
balladeer is refreshing in
today’s pop market. His tunes
are not exactly complex, but
they’re soothing. Yes, they can get irritating in parts (especially in the last
track where he goes from a high, piercing nasal whine to talking like
McGruff the Crime Dog for no good reason), but that’s why most good CD
players let you program certain tracks out while keeping the real gems. In
a mixed bag like Martin Sexton’s “The American,” that program button is a
true blessing.

BY COREY STULCE
WRITER AT LARGF.
It’s been at least a few weeks
since I’ve talked about this, so I
am sure all of you loyal readers
out there were wondering when I
was going to bring this subject up
again. No, I ’m not referring to the
love/hate relationship betw een
D arth Vader and C haro, I’m
talking about sex.

19, 1998

T h e

Oh, so now you’re paying
attention. I promise I won’t shock
and disgust you with personal
tales of my own disturbing
experiences for a change. I will
try to keep things general.
I think there are too many
things that are still unclear about
the subject. I mean, what is sex?
What does it mean to say “We
had sex” ? I think in these
unsure times we need some
clarification.
After dirty-dog Bill came up
with his confusing and vague
definition of sex, I knew it was
time to come up with something a
little clearer.
Jerry Seinfeld once said sex
happens whenever the nipple
makes its first appearance. I think
that’s a little much. I’ve seen too
many nipples to know that’s the
case. So, where does the sex
begin? I need to have an answer
so when my grandma calls me up
and asks, “Corey, did you get

some sex this weekend?” I will
know what to tell her. I can’t say,
“Well Grammy, I’m not sure. I
mean, I saw nipple. Does that
count?” I have to tell her yes or
no. So, let’s figure it out together.
Kissing is definitely not sex.
I’m not knocking kissing, now.
It’s good stuff and it usually leads
to more interesting stuff. After
kissing comes the heavy petting
or rubbing or w hatever you
would like to call it. I don’t think
this is sex either.
Now we come to the gray
area. I will do my best to not use
very crude terms, so bear with
me. The question is if someone
“assists” you with an orgasm
with a nonsexual appendage, is it
sex, or are they just doing you a
solid? I don’t think that is sex. I
think that is just “assisted”
masturbation. Maybe it’s just a
thank-you for a nice dinner. But I
don’t consider that as sex.
Neither is just nudity, but,

Page

nudity and sleeping in the same
bed holding each other is another
gray area. This could be
construed as sex if certain parts
just happen to nudge together (by
accident, of course), but I still
don’t think sex has occurred yet.
One of the bigger debates I
have heard is the one about oral
sex. Even though the word “sex”
is in the name, some people don’t
consider oral sex as sex. I
wavered on this idea for a while,
but I have come to the decision
that, yes, oral sex is sex.
I decided this for two
reasons. The first is that
intercourse should not be the only
type of sex out there. Some
people cannot have intercourse,
so they are left with the option of
oral sex. I mean, everyone has to
have a sex option, you know.
The second reason is oral
sex, to me, is a lot more intimate
than traditional sex. I think it’s a
lot to ask of someone to do that. I

am pretty careful about where I
put my mouth, as I’m sure others
are. So, I think it’s a big
commitment for someone to visit
those areas with the old food
hole. Whew. I was hoping I could
get through this without having to
say, “Put some slobber on the
knobber” or some other crude
term. I hope you appreciate it.
Perhaps it would be best to
not even discuss the other type of
sex I am thinking of. Yeah, that.
Yes, that is sex too, no matter
what you’ve heard in the past.
So, I hope this has cleared a
few things up. Now you have to
go out and adjust your numbers.
This might make it hard for some
people when they get asked, “So,
how many have you ...” But feel
free to clarify. You could always
say, “Well, yeah, but 37 of those
were just Lewinskys.” And those
of you who have ju st “seen
nipple” : sorry, you’re still a
virgin.

Dear Alii Khat,

I have a severe eating disorder. I eat way too much
chocolate. In order fo r you to understand the severity o f
my problem, I ’m going to give you a synopsis o f my
normal day. I wake up and eat Chocolate Balls
cereal with chocolate milk instead o f white milk.
Then on the way to school, I buy three candy bars — a
Kokopounder, a Mega Chocolate Bar with nuts, and a plain old
Hers hey's. I eat them during the 20-minute drive from the candy store
to school. At lunch, I fill up on chocolate ice cream, brownies, pudding
—you name it, I eat it. Anyway, I think you are getting the picture. Not
only can I not afford this amount o f chocolate intake, but I ’m also
gaining weight like a pregnant woman. What can I do?

I sympathize with you. I took many hours to think o f a cure fo r your
chocoholic behaviors and I have one now! Gather about $100 or set
and go buy as much Kahlua as you can afford. Then take it home and
drink and drink and drink until you are puking your guts out.
Trust me, this works. During my first experience with drinking, I got
smashed on about half o f a bottle o f Hot Damn. I puked fo r two days,
and afterwards I would look at the stuff and cringe. I couldn’t even
chew cinnamon-flavored Trident.

Wrestling begins season
with two All-Americans
BY BRIAN ANDERSON
FO R T H E ALESTLE
T he S IU E w restling te a m will begin its grueling season this
w eekend at the St. L ouis O p en . A s always, the beginning o f the
season is full of surprises, a n d th e first to u rn am en t is a good
indicator o f w ho will be step p in g on the m at for the rest of the
season.
A t 125 pounds, fresh m an Tark Johnson looks to m ake an
im pact on th e C ougar sq u ad this year. Tark is a 1998 M issouri
state cham pion from L in d e n b u rg H igh School. A lso look for
redshirt fresh m an Jose H e rn a n d e z of Cicero, 111., to m ake a
nam e for himself.
A t 133 pounds, re tu rn in g A ll-A m erican Jessie M ontez holds
his w eight class strong. M o n tez, a ju n io r college national runnerup a t T riton C ollege is com ing off his best season yet. H e placed
sixth in the D ivision II N C A A T ournam ent last year and looks
to up th a t m ark in his sen io r season.
The 141-pbund w eight class is probably the m ost interesting
as a couple rugged co m p e tito rs will b attle for this spot.
R eturning s ta rte r so p h o m o re D en ale Powell took second in the
tough St. L ouis O p en last year. Powell is a very quick and strong
w restler w ho will use his fresh m an experience to his advantage.
R edshirt freshm an and 1997 Illinois state cham pion N ath an
G raum en z of V andalia is a very slick w restler who is sure to go
far.
A t 149 pounds, look for sen io r Elijah R oberts to m ake a
form idable im pact on the C o u g ar team next sem ester. R o b erts
was ra n k e d am ong th e very best last y ear before he becam e
ineligible. His unique style m akes him interesting to w atch and
difficult to beat. R o b e rts is a 1997 ju n io r college national
runner-up.
A t 157 pounds, e x p erien ced senior D em os G lass o f Locust
G rove, O kla., is com ing o ff his redsh irt year ready to rum ble.
Glass to o k second in th e St. L ouis O pen two years ago and
looks im pressive in practices.
165-pound class h olds a n o th e r returning A ll-A m erican in
ju n io r T itus Taylor. T aylor finished the 1998 season with a 23-9
record an d a fourth place finish in the N C A A Division II
T ournam ent last year. T aylor is a ju n io r college national runnerup and is nationally ra n k e d No. 2 in the preseason .
U nfortunately, T aylor is reco v erin g from a back injury and will
miss the first tw o w eeks o f com petition.
The 184-pound w eight class is held by freshm an B arry
W ickw are o f T erra H au te, Ind.

Novem ber 21-22 at Florence, Alabam a
♦N orth A labam a (36-5) vs A labam a-H untsville (32-5)

BASKETBALL ______________ _ _ _
from page 8

b o ard s while senior April Clendenin grabbed a team-high 12
rebounds.
The Cougars will travel to Kenosha, Wis. to battle the University of
Wisconsin-Parkside a week from Saturday in a game that shouldn’t
give SIUE many problems.
Wisconsin-Parkside is currently 0-1 after losing its first contest of
the season to Michigan Technological University.
SIUE will take the court with a 1-0 record with the hopes of getting
a leg up on the Great Lakes Valley Conference standings.
In their descent from Wisconsin, SIUE will also make a stop in
Romeoville to play Lewis University on Monday.

from page 8

h e a rt isn’t in th e gam e? N o problem . Som eone else will pick
you up.
A n o th e r situ atio n a little closer to hom e: L e o n ard L ittle of
the Ram s, w ho fatally injured a w om an in a car accident a few
w eeks ago, has been d ete rm in e d m entally and em otionally unfit
to play football. B ut h e re ’s the deal — Little will still collect his
base salary which is $180,000. L et me recap to m ake sure I have
it straight. T he m an gets legally drunk at a bar, kills a w om an,
d o esn ’t have to go to w ork, m ay face years in prison, gets paid
$180,000.1 just d o n ’t und erstan d .
A gents trying to rationalize th eir clients’ actions by saying
they w ere drunk, leagues letting peo p le play for th em no m a tte r
w hat th eir actions, crim inals collecting the kinds of salaries m ost
of us will never see ... it’s all getting o u t of control. A t least with
D ylan com ing back to B everly Hills 90210, th e re is still a bit of
o rd e r in this crazy w orld.
O n the b rig h te r side, co n gratulations to th e following: the
w om en’s soccer team for a great year; the w om en's volleyball
team for m aking th e N C A A to u rn am en t; M ichelle G ilm an and
Janece Friedrich fo r being nam ed G LV C Player o f the Y ear in
volleyball and soccer respectively; and Lindsay R ust, A n n U lrich,
Kristi S tedm an, M ichelle M ontgom ery, K arin T ighe,T asha Siegel,
R ebecca Mays, M att L ittle and Kividi K ikam a for m aking th eir
all-conference team s.
