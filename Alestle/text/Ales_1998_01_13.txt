MLK award
■ BY DANIELLE

ACTING EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
Youngchoon Hahm has been
named the recipiant of the Dr.
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
Scholarship and Humanitarian
Award here at SIUE.
Hahm, of Alton and a native
of Korea, will receieve this award
and special recognition during the
King Birthday Celebration,
Thursday, Jan. 22, at an 11:30
a.m. luncheon in the University
Center.
The award includes a $100
cash stipend and a scholarship
which provides for tuition or fees
or housing for one academic year
of full-time undergraduate study
or graduate study at the Illinois
rate.
Hahm is an undergraduate at
SIUE who expects to recieve his
bachelor degree in Nursing in
1998.
Hahm
already
has
completed two baccalaureate
degrees at SIUE; a B.S. in
Business Adminsitration and a
B.A. in Spanish Language. He
has also recieve numerous awards
here at SIUE including the
Kimmel Leadership Award,
International Business School
Award and Phi Kappa Phi
Scholarship.

Cool grooves and cross
cultures
may
be
in
Edwardsville’s future with the
proposal of 10,000 seat
ampitheater to be built here
near SIUE.
The Sonic Group, which
is building this theater, held a
meeting lanuary 7 to provide
information
about
their
venture.
The ampitheater will be
known as the Mississippi

River Festival and will be
located off of Bluff and Hoag
roads on what is now farm
land.
The 10,000 seats will be
placed in a covered area that
can be changed to adjust for
the season. With retractable
sides that can be lowered and
raised, the theater will be well
suiting for both the summer
and winter months.
“The university and the
city are going to gain a lot of
expsure especially with the
cultural aspect,” said Rob
Wiemers, vice president of the
Sonic Group.

The Sonic Group believes
that this ampitheater will help
bring
diversity
and
entertainment, as well as
revenue to the city and school.
According to Walter
Heck the city stands to gain
some extra revenue through a
proposed
3
percent
entertainment tax that has
been projected to generate an
estimated
$400,000
for
Edwardsville. Property taxes
from the facility are projected
by the group to bring in an
addtional
$50,000.
The
schools of Edwardsville stand
to gain up to $110,000. There

is also a proposed 1 percent
tax for merchandise, food and
other items sold at the
ampitheater during the events
that could bring in anywhere
between $60,000 and $80,000
for the city.
Though the group hopes
to attract bands to the theater,
they do not want music to be
their only attraction. The
ampitheater will be open for
plays, musical theater, and
cultural events.
Along with hope, the
venture brings some worry.

More than money a t stake in sale
o f Chicago Black daily newspaper
CHICAGO (AP) Ensconced on the South
Side, the Chicago Defender has languished in
recent decades, a shadow of the crusading
newspaper that once helped lure blacks off
southern plantations into northern factories.
Now after the death of the man who
controlled the paper for six decades, the
Defender, along with its sister newspapers in
Pittsburgh, Detroit and Memphis is for sale.
And activists fear the sale of the nation’s
largest black daily could silence a publication
that has long been the community’s voice.
“We would be very disturbed if any other
ethnic group acquired the paper and wanted
to keep calling it an ‘afro-centric’ paper,’ said
the Rev. AL Sampson, organizer of a group
called the Citizens Committee to Save the
Chicago Defender. “They won’t be able to
speak for our community.”
The Defender dates back to 1905 when
Robert Abbott arrived in Chicago nearly
penniless and founded the newspaper as a
weekly. It went on to be read by thousands in
the South, where it was distributed by
Pullman porters and sold by newsboys who
risked being lynched for their actions.
The Defender was hated by southern whites
for its editorials, which urged blacks to
abandon the Jim Crow south and its cotton
fields for the north’s factories and less

menacing segregation. Between 1910 and
1920, Chicago’s black population increased
from 44,000 to 109,000. And a second major
migration north of blacks, promoted by the
Defender, occurred in the 1940s.
The Defender’s editors also were threatened
with jail during World War II for editorials
pointing out that black soldiers were risking
their lives for freedoms abroad they could not
enjoy at home. The newspaper was home to
black writers ignored by the white press,
including Langston Hughes and W.E.B.
DuBois, a founder of the NAACP.
“It is a bigger issue than the selling of an
individual newspaper,” said Dorothy Leavell,
president of the National Newspaper
Publishers Association, which is made up of
the owners of 215 black weekly newspapers.
“There is the historical perspective. It
being the only black daily newspaper left. It
has a significant place in black history.”
The Defender and its legacy was put up for
grabs after John Sengstacke, nephew of the
paper’s founder, died last year at the age of
84. In 1975, he placed Sengstacke Enterprises
Inc. in trust with instructions that it be sold
upon his death. Sengstacke’s heirs, including
six grandchildren, have no say in the matter.
Although the Northern Trust Co.,
Sengstacke’s trustee, has not put a price tag

on the newspapers and their property, some
estimate they could fetch $8 million to $10
million.
“We are confident that every effort will be
made to secure fair value for the shareholders
while at the same time finding a buyer who
will be cognizant of the legacy of John
Sengstacke and the special role of the
publications in the community,” the bank said
in a statement.
Bank spokeswoman Sue A. Regeas said
privacy laws limit what the bank can say
about the sale. But she said the estate has not
received any firm offers.
Sampson, a community organizer who
worked with Dr. Martin Luther King, said his
group wants to do more than monitor the sale
of the Defender. They want community input
into how it is run and are trying to form a
group of investors to buy the paper.
Sampson also said his group would work to
increase the Defender’s circulation if it is
bought by the right people. The daily has a
paid circulation of 16,000 and weekend
circulation of 19,000. In the 1950s, when it
first became a daily, circulation topped
50,000.

PAPER
from p a g e 1
Because it is privately
owned, revenues aren’t available.
But the Defender and the other
Sengstacke newspapers are
profitable.
Leavell, who publishes two
weeklies, the Chicago Crusader
and its counterpart in Gary, Ind.,
and others note the Defender’s
decline can be attributed to
dwindling advertising revenue.
"Jo h n Sengstacke often
complained
he
had
the
advertising base of a weekly in a
daily newspaper,” she said. It was
further hurt by its continued
support of the Democratic
machine in the 1970s, when
Chicago’s black electorate was
becoming
increasingly
independent.
" I t still serves the community,”
Leavell said. "B ut not to the

Dispatch. He will address the
theme, “Believing/Be Living The
Dream” in his speech.
The luncheon program is
scheduled at 11:30 a.m. in the
Meridian Hall, in the University

followed by a reception in the
Goshen Lounge for Freeman and
winners of the scholarship and
humanitarian awards who will be
honored at the luncheon. In
addition, there will be a lecture

from special guest, Morris Dees,

Although the Defender is the
best known of Sengstacke
Enterprises’ holdings, the weekly
Michigan Chronicle in Detroit is
the company’s most prized

possession. With a circulation of
about 43,000, the Chronicle is

Review committee should be commended fo r
handling space allocation decision w ith grace
A new year, a new semester,
a new beginning. At least that is
what I wish for the members of
the
Constitution
Review
Committee
of
Student
Government. At long last the fall
semester is behind them. More
importantly, however, is the fact
that the annual space allocation
issue has finally reached closure.
By the time this letter is printed
the 17 workspaces administered
by the Kimmel Leadership
Center will be occupied by their
new (or returning) student
organizations.
Throughout
the
entire
drawn-out process the committee
members acted with calm and
professionalism. They never once
lost sigh of their goal: to attempt
to make a decision that would

benefit the majority of student
organizations that applied for the
workspace. What the University
Community does not know is the
amount of time the committee
members put into deliberating the
decision
and
appeasing
applicants. Committee time alone
was over ten hours, but outside
this many, many more hours were
spent talking with student
organization leaders and advisers
from the Kimmel Leadership
Center.
At no time was there intent
from the committee to act with a
personal bias, as was suggested at
times. I can guarantee that the
advisers to the committee would
not permit this. The committee
was merely guilty of taking its
job seriously. It chose to totally

reassess the allocation of the
office workspace as is its right
and duty under the Student
Government Bylaws. Its goal was
to attempt to organize the three
Kimmel Leadership Center
offices in a more equitable
manner that would have the
greatest benefit to the widest
student
population.
Unfortunately, from e beginning
of the process the committee was
not permitted to perform it’s task
without external interference.
Rumors and counter-rumors
appeared from whom knows
where.
What saddens me is the fact
that this whole incident will be
remembered for all the bitterness
it developed on campus. Instead
of
this,
the
committee’s

dedication and commitment to
the well being of the wider
student population should be
commended. Senator Michelle
Williams worked hard in
attempting
to
reach
a
compromise that was agreeable
to all parties involved. Kyle
Thompson and Chad Gruenke
endured hours of committee
sessions. But special mention
must be made of CRC chair
Senator Mike Loitz. During the
appeal process Senator Loitz was
accused of racism and of holding
a personal agenda. This was
Senator Loitz’s first semester as
chair of the committee and I must
commend him on the job he
performed. Indeed, I urge the
entire University Community to
thank every member of the CRC

for bringing closure to a very
delicate matter. If these students
are indicative of the caliber of
students at SIUE then we can
truly say that SIUE develops
leaders of which we can be
proud.
I am honored to be able to
work with the CRC and thank
each committee member for the
opportunity of advising such
prolific campus leaders. Let us
hope that this semester will
afford us the opportunity to get
back to the regular matters of
business.

Letters to the editor
More views on results of space allocation and the Alestle’s role
In regards to the editorial which appeared in the Dec.
4 issue of the Alestle, written by Chad Gruenke of the
Constitution Review Committee, he stated that the world
does not revolve around BSA as far as the office space
allocation is concerned. He should be ashamed of himself
for making a statement like that. BSA represents this
school very well. BSA is held in high esteem among
students, faculty, and staff here. I felt like he disrespected
the entire African-American student body with that
statement. In other words, he’s saying just because we
didn’t let the committee have it their way on office space

allocation, we are not worthy. That, my friend, is stupid or
ignorant on your part. Also, to comment on the anger
being expressed toward the news editor, Danielle Belton.
I am appalled that some students would be angry at her
just because she published the truth about the office space
situation. Danielle is a hard working, professional
individual, she is honest and forthright about what goes on
at this school. We need more students with that kind of
dignity. All of this brings home a very important point, get
involved. When we have students who get involved we
can stop discrimination, intimidation, and lies. So, in

I would like to start off by admitting that my editorial in
Thursday’s (Dec. 4, 1997) Alestle was rather harsh. I would like to
apologize for this and state that I am truly sorry for anyone I may
have offended. I have come to realize the worst time to write an
editorial is when you are blinded by anger. The outpouring of anger
throughout my last editorial was built up over the many weeks that
the space allocation has occurred. Let’s face it, there are only so
many times one can be called biased and falsely accused before they
just snap. Once again, I am sorry for the statements I made and hope
that this will all be put behind us.

The editors, staff and publishers of the Alestle believe in
the free exchange of ideas, concerns and opinions and will
publish as many letters to the editor as possible. All letters
should be typed and double-spaced and be no longer than
500 words. Please include your phone number, signature
and social security number.
We reserve the right to edit letters for grammar and
content However, great care will be taken to ensure that the
message of the letter is not lost or altered.
Letters to the editor will not be printed anonymously
except under extreme circum stances.
The Alestle is a member o f the Illinois College
Press Association.
The name Alestle is an acronym derived from the
names o f the three campus locations o f SIUE:
Alton, East St. Louis and Edwardsville.

Ice, ice everywhere to somes dismay
on the first day back on campiis
It is really amazing to see our tuition dollars hard at work. I find it even more amusing that on the first
day of class, when 90% of the students are on campus, the walkways are still covered with ice from the
freezing rain that started during the night. Maintenance (oh sorry, the politically correct term for janitorial
services is now “Facilities Management”) has done absolutely nothing to ensure the safety of the students
and employees. In fact, at 8 a.m. this moning after I watched several people slip, I also noticed the two
“facilities management” workers standing by their truck drinking coffee. So this is the reason tuition keeps
increasing?

Chad Gruenke
Constitution Review Committee Member
Letters to the editor policy:

conclusion I hope that we, as students, can learn from this,
and say we are fed up with some people in student
government who constantly distort the truth, and love to
place blame on the Alestle and other great organizations
such as BSA.

The A lestle is published on Tuesdays and
Thursdays during fa ll and spring sem esters, and on
Wednesdays during summer sem esters. For more

Study shows some fats may cut breast cancer risk
CHICAGO (AP) _ A new
study adds to growing evidence
that eating monounsaturated fats
_ the kind found in olive and
canola oils _ may significantly
reduce the risk of breast cancer.
It also found that women
whose daily diets included
polyunsaturated fats _ those
found in other varieties of
vegetable oils and seafood _ had
a strongly increased breastcancer risk.
The findings by researchers
who studied more than 60,000
women in Sweden appear in
Monday’s issue of Archives of
Internal Medicine, published by
the
American
Medical
Association.
“Our results indicate that
various types of fat may have
specific opposite effects on the
risk of breast cancer,” wrote the
authors, led by researcher Alicja
Wolk at Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm. Epidemiologists at

Harvard’s School of Public
Health also participated.
The results generally are in
line with previous studies, though
research linking polyunsaturated
fats with breast cancer risk is less
clear-cut, said Dr. Neal Barnard,
head
of
the
Physicians
Committee for Responsible
Medicine, a Washington-based
educational and research group.
“It’s an important study but
it has tremendous potential for
being misinterpreted,” Barnard
said.
For one thing, the study
population was homogenous _
Swedes generally have a high-fat
diet that would tend to skew the
results, Barnard said.
“It’s like trying to find
inferences in lung cancer rates
when everybody is a smoker,” he
said. “People who got it would be
differentiated by something else
other than smoking.”
The study subjects’ daily fat

intake averaged 30 percent of
total calories consumed. U.S.
federal guidelines advise limiting
fat to no more than 30 percent of
total calories, but Barnard said
that’s still too high to be healthful
and more than triple the fat intake
of societies where breast cancer
rates are extremely low, such as
rural China.
Barnard also cautioned that
the findings “should not be
interpreted as a license to glug
the olive oil.”
Regardless of its source,
“every gram of fat packs nine
calories,” he noted. "T he heavier
you are, the higher your risk for
breast cancer, especially after
menopause.”
The study involved 61,471
women aged 40 through 76 who
were questioned between 1987
and 1990 about their fat intake.
During an average follow-up of
4.2 years, 674 cases of invasive
breast cancer were diagnosed.

Women who ingested at least
10 grams of monounsaturated fat
daily _ about three-fourths of a
tablespoon _ cut their risk of
breast cancer in half.
The results were similar to
previous studies that looked
specifically at olive oil, the main
source of monounsaturated fat in
Mediterranean diets.
The authors, noting that
olive oil consumption is very low
in Sweden, say their study shows
that it’s the kind of fat rather than
specifically olive oil that reduces
the breast-cancer risk.
Women who ate at least 5
grams daily of polyunsaturated
fats, such as those found in
safflower and com oils, increased
their breast-cancer risk by 69
percent.
Polyunsaturated fats may
"alter the risk of breast cancer by
increasing the formation of free
radicals that can damage DNA
and
promote
tumor

development,”
Wolk
and
colleagues wrote.
Free radicals are dangerous
byproducts that form when the
body metabolizes oxygen. They
are thought to produce cellular
damage that can lead to cancer.
Others have theorized that
monounsaturated fats are less
easily
oxidized
than
polyunsaturates and that they
contain antioxidant vitamins that
soak up free radicals.
Switching types of fat likely
would be easier to swallow for
most people than long-term
reduction in total fat intake, the
authors said.
Barnard, however, said
cutting total fat intake should also
be a goal for most Western
societies in order to reduce
incidence of many types of
cancer as well as cardiovascular
disease.

Six frozen human shoulders stolen from truck meant for medical research
PHOENIX (AP) _ Talk about getting the cold
shoulder.
Last Wednesday, a box with six frozen human
shoulders was stolen from a truck about to deliver them
to a Phoenix air freight service, police said.
The shoulders, bound for an Illinois research
laboratory, were among other boxes of body parts picked
up at the Anatomic Gift Foundation in Phoenix, and taken
to Ches Trucking Co., near Sky Harbor International
Airport.
The foundation is a non-profit organization that
coordinates recovery, processing and distribution of
human tissue for research at laboratories and medical
schools, company spokesman Steven Williams said.
Every year, thousands of people nationwide die

having already donated all or part of their bodies, he said.
Williams noted that donations are made either for
transplant or research; the Anatomic Gift Foundation
accepts whole body and body parts donations for research
only.
The owner of Ches Trucking said the truck, loaded
mostly with shoulders, was left unattended, "fo r five
minutes at the most.”
“When I realized a box was gone, we started looking
around the area for it right away,” John Chester said.
The box with the shoulders weighed about 40
pounds. The parts were wrapped in clear plastic and cloth,
Chester said.
He found the box empty in a nearby field within
minutes of the theft. The thief had carried it about 300

FREE SIUE COUGAR

yards.
Williams said his company charges only for the
processing of the body parts, “ because it is illegal to buy
and sell human tissue.”
The processing value of the shoulders was about
$3,100, Williams said.
Chester said that “the thief probably saw just the
word 'perishable’ on the end of the box, thought it was a
food product of some value, and ran with it.”
“I hope he didn’t go home and tell his wife he got a
bargain somewhere, and then have her open it,” Chester
said. “That could be quite a shock.”

and
enviromental problems.
“It’s real important to make
sure this community stays top
notch,” Joanne E. Grasser,
executive director of the Alliance
of Edwardsville and Glen Carbon
said.
The Alliance is an economic
organization that works to
promote and manage economic
development in Edwardsville and
Glen Carbon. Though Grasser
believes that the amphitheater is a
good deal for all, she also

believes these concerns must be
and will be examined and
addressed.
The group contends that the
amphitheater will cause few
problems with the facility have
three exits to help with traffic.
They are planting five trees for
every tree destroyed during
construction to help muffle the
noise.
“It has got a lot of potential,”
Grasser said. “It’s the type of
project we want.”
The Sonic Group has already
shown its plans to SIU President
Ted Sanders and SIUE Vice
Chancellor for Development and
Public Affairs James R. Buck and
claim to have their approval.

Wiemers also hopes SIUE
will consider hosting some of its
major events such as graduation
or plays at the amphitheater.
“We especially feel that its a
great culture facility,” said
Wiemers.
This $10-12 million project
hopes to break ground in May of
1998 and then hopefullly open in
the Spring of 1999 to host about
70 events a year.
There will be another
meeting on the amphitheater
open to the public, at the City
Hall in Edwardsville on Jan. 15 at
4:30 p.m. All are encourage to
attend.

LIFESTYLE EDITOR
I hate to complain, but I have
a little gripe with the last legal
toxicant. Well, I don’t have a
problem with the drink itself,
just those who partake in it a
little gregariously.
I don’t like most drunks. The
only people who do like drunks
are drunks. I am a very calm
and controlled drunk. Sure, my
senses are dulled, but my brain
still works very hard to keep
me from looking like a
complete asshole. My brain
won’t let me climb onto a table
in a bar for an impromptu jig'. I
love my brain.
Some people’s brains are
malicious. For example, the
other night I was enjoying
myself at a club. I’m used to
being in a smoky, over­
crowded joint and I don’t mind
people touching my intimate
areas when they shove by me. I
do, however, get extremely
ticked when someone pushes
their way past and then stops
right in front of me. I don’t
care for uncourteous drunks.
I was forced to deal with a
30-something guy who
desperately wanted to sex-up
his date whether she was
conscious or not. For some
reason she wanted to be part of
the show. She had a nasty
penchant for falling onto me.
He appeared to be amused by
her drunken stupor and
encouraged her.
Any instinct acted upon from
me would have resulted in a
fight, and I was quite enjoying
the band. So, I stifled the
thoughts of: a. tossing a drink
in her face, b. politely telling
him to keep his girlfriend on a
shorter leash, or c. yanking her
to the floor by her purse strap
and exploding his nose with
my elbow. Fortunately, she
made the “I’m about to puke
chowder” face and they split.
Anyone who has ever been to
a club has had that experience.
Usually it’s some drunken frat
guy or skin head that butts up
in front of you. And you just
scowl, say that you’re going to
kick his ass, and then politely
wait until he leaves to piss on
somebody else’s good time,
which is what I did.

Creator Mike Allred uses
ingenuity and courage to
break into the many facets
o f the entertainment world
U BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
Mike Allred is conquering the arts and doing it on his own
terms. He has established himself in the world of comic books
with “Madman,” his popular super hero epic. He is now
breaking into the realms of film and music, reviving the idea
that art should be free and independent. By definition, he is on
his way to becoming a renaissance man, but he would not use
that word to describe himself.
“I would like to invent another word that doesn’t sound so
pretentious,” Allred said. “I’m really just a guy who found out
I didn’t have to wait for permission to do what I wanted to
do.”
Allred got his start in comics at small distributors like
Tundra. It was there where his most famous
character, Madman, developed a
following. “Madman” is
the story of a man
who is desperately
trying to discover
his past and true
identity, all the while
falling in love and
helping his scientist
friends
with
their
experiments.
Allred has a modest,
but elegant, drawing style
and he uses very witty
dialogue. It was his
interesting and original style
that got his book published
by Dark Horse Comics. Dark
Horse is still a very
independent or non-conformist
distributor and gives its creators
much more control of their
books.
Over the last two years, Allred
has made two films, “Astroesque’
and “Eyes to Heaven” and recorded
an album with his band Red Rocket
7. The band is named after the comic
mini-series that began in September.
Although Allred has only recently
delved into film and music, he said the
seeds were always there waiting to be
cultivated. “My whole life, things have
revolved around music and comics,’
Allred said. “I had this huge chunk of
useless knowledge in my head, an
encyclopedia of music, film and comic book

trivia. The best way to exercise
that is to work in those
mediums,” he said.
“I guess my life the last
couple of years has been about
not sitting around wishing for
these things to happen
someday, hoping my band
would be discovered by
some record executive, or
some
Hollywood
executive would find one
of my screenplays under
a pile of dust,” Allred
said.
His first film
“Astroesque,” which
he wrote, starred in
and directed will be
released on home
video by Dark
Horse on Jan. 21.
It is a science
fiction epic and has a
similar style to his comic series,
Red Rocket 7. “Eyes to Heaven,” the second
film from Allred’s production company, Droog Bros.,
was completed earlier this year. He describes it as similar to
an episode of the “Twilight Zone.” “It’s a really eerie, ultra-

“Technology has become
affordable. I took option
money
from
the
“Madman” movie and
built my own recording
studio, which is relatively
affordable. Anybody who
could max out a couple of
credit cards could build
the same studio and have
better equipment than The
Beatles ever had. So,
when you realize that, it’s
phenomenal,” he said. The
album by Red Rocket 7 is
set for release soon.
Jamie Rich, Allred’s
editor at Dark Horse, said
he deals with criticism
very
professionally.
“Everything is fine as long
as I tell him I love him,”
Rich said. “Seriously,
though, he takes a very
even-handed approach to
criticism. He knows when
something is just
plain
dumb and
unfounded and when
he needs to take it
seriously. As far as
editorial criticism, if
the books didn’t
come in so damn
good, I might have
some.”
Earlier this year,
Allred
had
a
o
appearance
in
Kevin
Smith’s
film
“Chasing
Amy,”
as
himself. He met
Smith
at
a
c o m i c
convention and
was offered the
job of doing
the art for Smith’s film, ‘Mallrats.” He
subsequently did the majority of artwork for
“Chasing Amy” as well.
While working on “Chasing Amy,” Allred got
to meet one of his film heroes, Robert Rodriguez
(“El Mariachi,” “Desperado”). After Rodriguez
screened Allred’s film, “Astroesque,” he gave it
a rave review which now appears on the video
box.
“The greatest thing that could ever happen
when you’re striving to do something is when
you have your heroes and your heroes become
your peers. And that has happened. It
happened in comics and now it’s happening in
the [independent] film community,” Allred
said.
Allred is planning a summer tour to meet
some of his fans and to get their input. “I’ve
enjoyed every encounter I’ve had with a
fan,” he said. “They fit into two categories.
The ones that are more shy, I have to draw
out. The others are those who are not afraid
to tell me what they thought, good or bad.

business for a long time. “Having done these other
things has just reaffirmed my commitment to
comics,” he said. “I love film and I love music and
working in both has been a wonderful experience,
very cathartic. It’s just opened my eyes more to how
powerful my first success with comics is.”
“We have to constantly slap ourselves and
remind ourselves what success is about. I’m in a
place now where I can feed my family and have a
nice home to live in and I can do whatever I want.
That’s success,” Allred said.
“I can finally let go and not worry about being
famous or a household name. It’s something I admit
to having wanted in the past, but I’ve also used my
imagination to figure out what that would be like
and it’s not necessarily good. I kind of like being a
cult figure in a sub-culture.”

Some are very critical in a very constructive way
and I welcome that. Most are very excited about
what I’m trying to do. I wouldn’t be doing this big
tour otherwise.”
With all of these projects, it would be hard for
the average person to be away from his spouse so
much.
For Allred, it is not a problem. His wife, Laura,
does all of the coloring for his comic books. “The
only disadvantage was the initial fear that when she
started doing it full time we would get sick of each
other. And we haven’t, so there are no
disadvantages,” Allred said.
Laura Allred has also found her niche
in the comic business. Last summer she
was voted Best Colorist at the Chicago
ComicCon by fans who participated in a
poll from “Wizard” magazine. The trophy
is the first item people are drawn to in the
Allred home, Mike said. He added that he
believes Laura is the best colorist working
in comics today.
Rich concurs Laura is an integral part
of Mike’s work. “If you took her out of
the equation, the series [Red Rocket 7]
would suffer considerably. And she makes
every deadline — and is early too! An
editor’s dream,” Rich said. On the other
hand, fans do have to wait significantly
for issues of “Madman” to hit the shelves.
They are released very sporadically. But
with Allred’s busy schedule, such can be
expected. Rich had no comment on
whether Allred works on specific
deadlines or not.
Allred plans to stay in the comic Cover of issue tw o’s “Red Rocket 7."

Chicago passing on democratic
convention, woos republicans
CHICAGO (AP) _ The city where Democratic
Party loyalty is all but an official religion has
served notice that it is willing _ and even eager _ to
engage in political heresy for exactly one week in
2000 .

Chicago wants to be the site of the Republican
National Convention that year, and it is not
pursuing the Democrats’ convention any longer.
Democrats in Washington were informed of
the decision in a letter from city officials, said
Lawrence Gorski, director of Mayor Richard M.
Daley’s Office for People with Disabilities.
Chicago will now focus on luring the
Republicans and already has shown why this city
would make an excellent choice, Gorski said
Sunday.
“We did a very fine job when we had the
Democratic National Convention here two years
ago,” he said.
The 1996 Democratic National Convention
was the first held in Chicago since the convention
week in 1968, when club-swinging police chased

antiwar demonstrators through streets and parks
amid
clouds of tear gas, leaving the city with a
monumental black eye.
Chicago Democrats _ who have had a lock on
the mayor’s office since the Great Depression and
rarely face a serious challenge from Republicans _
came away from the 1996 convention proud that it
went off without a major hitch.
Gorski said the city didn’t try to get the
Republican convention in 1996 because Chicago’s
contract with the Democrats barred it from having
both parties in the same year. The Democratic Party
insisted on the provision, he said.
While the 2000 Democratic National
Convention won’t be held in Chicago, Gorski will
have a say in where it is held.
He recently was named vice-chair of the
Democratic National Committee’s Site Advisory
Committee, which will pick the site of the next
convention.

Junior midfielder Matt Little
helped put the cherry on top of a
sweet 18-2-1 season for Cougar
men’s soccer by being named a

He is No. 2 in the Great Lakes

played a tough schedule and his
numbers got better.”
Three more Cougars received
honors for performance this
season. Junior defender Kividi
Kikama from Lombard, 111.
received All-Midwest first team
respects as well as sophomore
keeper Andy
Korbesmeyer.
Korbesmeyer allowed only 18
goals in 21 games and recorded
six shutouts.
“Andy really stands out on the
field, he directs traffic well and
has good statistics to support that
presence,” Huneke said.
Kikama’s defense helped
SIUE to be in the top 10 in
the country and his role on
the field is well fulfilled

according to Huneke.
“We want our attack to come
out of the backfield, and Kividi’s
skill level helped us do that this
year. He can do things with the
ball that most forwards can’t,”
Huneke said.
Second team All-Midwest
accolades went to senior forward
Darren Snyder who recently put
in some work with the St. Louis
Ambush indoor team. Snyder
wrapped up his SIUE career in
the top 10 in scoring, goal scoring
and assists. Two of Snyder’s
six goals this season were
game winners.
“Darren is a very colorful
player,” Huneke said. “He has
come through with big scores this
year and in the past. The fact that
he is playing professionally says
a lot for his game.”
Three of the four award
winners are returning next
season, which in Huneke’s
opinion only sets the stage to
keep winning next year.

still trying to
put fire
behind him
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) —
Nearly eight months after an
arsonist’s fire destroyed Reggie
Miller’s $2 million home, the
Indiana Pacers guard still is
coming to grips with his loss.
Compounding matters, the
investigation into the May 15
blaze has produced no solid
leads.
“I’m mad because we haven’t
come to a resolution, but I’m also
embarrassed, because of all the
professional athletes I know, why
would this happen to me?” Miller
said. “If this can happen to me, it
can happen to anyone.”
Not knowing who torched his

14,000-square-foot home makes
Miller edgy.
“It could even be someone
who comes to every single
game,” he said. “That’s what
makes me mad, the not-knowing
part.”
Although Miller doesn’t
believe the aftermath of the fire
has affected his play this season he is averaging a team-high 19.6
points - it has influenced his
personal life and his relationship
with the public.
He thought about retiring at
one point, but has decided to keep
Indianapolis his home, he told the
Indianapolis Star and News.
Eddie Moore, the public
information officer for the
Hamilton
County
Sheriff’s
Department, said about eight
calls were received from viewers
of the television show America’s
Most Wanted after a segment
about the fire was aired last fall.

A l e s i l e

But the tips led nowhere.
“We’re not close to any
answers, and there are no strong
suspects,” Moore said. “We’re
still seeking help from the
community.”
Miller and his wife, Marita,
are not suspects, Moore said.
Miller, in his 11th year in the
NBA, said the fire disturbed him
so much during the summer that
he considered retiring. The
prospect of playing for Larry
Bird, hired seven days before the
blaze,
and
a
subsequent
conversation with the new coach
helped change his mind.
He has hired additional
security officers for personal
protection and is more wary of
fans.
“I don’t want people thinking
I’m a prima donna or that I’m
bigger than anyone else, but I still
don’t know who burned down my
house,” Miller said.

Pippen unsure about playing with Bulls next year
CHICAGO (AP) — Scottie
Pippen’s ailing foot? Much
better. His relationships with
those in the front office? They
may never be mended.
“I don’t think they’ve been
repaired at all. We haven’t tried
to repair them. I don’t think they
can be repaired,” Pippen said.

Pippen asked for a trade two
months ago while recovering
from foot surgery. He said he’d
never play again for the Bulls
because general manager Jerry
Krause had not shown him the
respect he feels he deserved and
tried to trade him.
“I think a player of my

caliber deserves better, so I had
to stand up and speak out for
myself.”
Now the question: Will
Pippen be a Bull for the rest of
the season?
“I don’t' know. I should be
asking you that,” he told a
reporter.
