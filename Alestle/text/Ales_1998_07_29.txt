EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
A grand jury has indicted an
East St. Louis high school senior
on sexual assault charges for an
alleged rape that took place in
Woodland Hall while attending
an educational program.
18-year-old,
Christopher
Hayden, of East St. Louis, was
issued the indictment on July 16
for an attack on a 17-year-old girl
also from East St. Louis.
Along with Hayden, a 16year-old boy took part in the
attack that allegedly occurred
between 3:15 and 4 p.m. The 16year-old was charged in juvenille
court.
All three were students
participating in the Upward
Bound Program. This summer
program, in its fourth year at
SIUE, is a six-week camp that
gives
students lessons
in
math, science, English, foreign
language and computers. The
students live in the residence hall
during the weekdays.
Circuit
Judge
Edward
Ferguson ordered Hayden to be
released
on
a
$50,000
recognizance bond. The juvenile
has also been released.
Both of the accused have
been removed from the camp.
Hayden has been banned
permenently from the campus.
Students for the program
were chosen through SIUE’s East
St. Louis Center.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A
federal law madq, it illegal for
Russell E. Weston Jr. to possess a
gun. But once he took one from a
relative, activists on both sides of
the gun control fight agree that no
law could have stopped his
shooting rampage.
Investigators say Weston
shoved past a metal detector,
fatally shot a police officer, then
pressed on into the Capitol. By
the time he was wounded and
captured Friday, moments later
another Capitol police officer
was fatally shot and a young

woman tourist was wounded.
“I don't know that there’s
going to be much hue and cry for
more gun control, because it does
not appear to be the kind of
situation where more gun laws
would make a difference,” Bob
Walker, president of Handgun
Control Inc., said.
National Rifle Association
spokesman Bill Powers pointed
out that the gunman broke several
existing gun laws.
It is illegal for civilians to
bring firearms into the District of
Columbia, and it is illegal for

them to bring guns onto the
Capitol grounds. And it is, of
course, illegal to shoot people.
“How much more illegal can
something be? Laws did not help
here,” Powers said.
Weston was once committed
to a mental institution, and thus
cannot legally have a firearm.
But he apparently took the gun
from a relative who did not report
it to police.
Current handgun control
laws focus on weapon sales.
There is solid opposition from the
gun lobby and little stomach

among opponents for laws that
would seize handguns already in
circulation.
Recent failed gun-control
attempts in the Senate focused on
keeping guns farther from the
reach of children. Although bitter
about the defeat of what they call
common sense measures, guncontrol advocates say they would
not have saved any lives Friday.
“Even we in our zeal do not
believe that gun control can stop
every crime,” Handgun Control
spokeswoman Naomi Paiss said.
Weston was charged with
killing federal police officers,

and other charges are pending.
Authorities have given no motive
for the shootings, but neighbors
and Weston’s father describe a
troubled man with a grudge
against the federal government.
The 41-year-old suspect has
entered no plea, and his mental
status remains an open question.
But Weston fits the profile of an
aggrieved loner — one of the
most problematic criminals for
authorities to deter, Robert
Ressler, who developed criminal
profiles during a 20-year FBI
career, said. He is now a security
consultant.

Ryan rolls out his environmental plan, criticizes
opponent Poshard’s vote against Clean Air Act

Police Incidents
Ambulance Call
On July 26, 1998 at 10:19 a.m., officers and Edwardsville
Ambulance responded to Cougar Village in reference to a sick
person. The victim, a female student, reported that she was having
severe stomach pains. She was transported to Anderson Hospital.

CHICAGO (AP) — George
Ryan, the Republican candidate
for Illinois governor, unveils
his environmental protection
plan, attacks his opponent for
voting against the Clean Air Act
and differs with those who
might suggest his TV ads were
too negative.
It was a busy weekend in the
gubernatorial race.
Ryan said Saturday the
cornerstone of his environmental
plan was a, $40 million annual
bond program so the state can
buy land and set it aside for open
spaces, foot and bike trails and
other recreational uses.
Illinois ranks 48th among
states in the amount of public
land set aside for its citizens, with
less than 5 percent designated for
that purpose, Ryan said.
His proposals also call for
completion of a trail linking Lake
Michigan with the Mississippi
River, continued free admission
to state parks, conserving several
nature areas around Illinois and
working with Congress to crack
down on water and air polluters.
“I will always consider the

Arrest
On July 26, 1998 at 12:39 a.m., officers stopped a vehicle for
disobeying a traffic control sign. Jandi Cox, age 19, and Dameenda
Cox, age 21, both of St. Louis, were arrested for unlawful
possession of cannabis. Jandi Cox received a verbal warning for
disobeying a traffic control sign and her vehicle was towed by
Cross Towing.
Fire Department Call
On July 21, 1998 at 6:41 p.m., officers and Edwardsville Fire
Department responded to the Olympic Stadium in reference to a
gas leak. Illinois Power also arrived on the scene. The gas leak
was secured.
Telephone Harassment
On July 22, 1998 at 2:39 a.m., officers responded to Cougar Village
Apartments in reference to a telephone harassment. A female
student reported that an unknown subject has called her twice and
hung up. Police are continuing their investigation.
Theft Under $300
On July 24, 1998 at 2:50 p.m., officers responded to Cougar Village
in reference to a theft. A female student reported that someone stole
a blank check from her apartment. Police are continuing their
investigation.

special interests” when the
congressman voted against re­
establishing the federal Clean Air
Act in 1990.
But Poshard said the law
cost his Southern Illinois
congressional district 20,000 coal
mining jobs.
“If George Ryan thinks
20,000 working families are a
narrow special interest, he
clearly has been in government
too long,” Poshard said in a
statement Friday.
He said former U.S. Sens.
Paul Simon and Alan Dixon also
had voted against the Clean Air
Act to protect jobs.
Poshard said he had worked
in Congress to protect natural
habitats. He says opposition to
that work has come mainly from
the GOP.
Ryan on Saturday disputed
the 20,000-job figure and said
Poshard was too parochial in his
Clean Air Act vote.
“You have to be more aware
of the citizens that only those in
your own district. Others have to
breathe the air, too,” he said.

impact of environmental policy
on business,” Ryan said at a
news conference at the Shedd
Aquarium with the stunning
Chicago skyline as a backdrop.
“But I believe our state can
protect the economic well-being
of industry and the health
and well-being of our people
by coming up with common
sense solutions based on
sound science.”
Ryan said he didn’t think
the gubernatorial campaign had
turned nasty with negative ads
clogging the airways.
“I would hope we can
continue to discuss the issues,”
he said. “My ads so far have
been on Glenn Poshard’s
voting record.”
The ads have attacked
Poshard's opposition to some
gun control measures. The
congressman has countered
with a commercial questioning
how Ryan’s brother got a
state contract for electronically
monitoring convicts confined to
their homes.
On Saturday, Ryan accused
Poshard of protecting “narrow

Traffic Accident
On July 26, 1998 at 5:29 a.m., officers responded to South
University Drive in reference to an accident. A vehicle, driven by
Hussein Nesimovic was traveling northbound in the inside lane.The
driver’s car then left the roadway on the west side of the road, lost
control and struck a guard rail on the east side on the road.
Nesimovic’s vehicle was towed by Cross Towing, and he was cited
for failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident.

“Gun control is strictly a
political thing. It has no bearing
on people like this,” Ressler said.
“If he didn’t do it with a gun,
he could have done it with a knife
or a bomb. You can’t legislate ...

Return of the Jedi? Bringing back the Cold
war
Star Wars is back. Though the once-flaming
arguments for and against an anti-missile shield faded
with the Cold War, a new version of the defense debate
is back.
Russia and China are not considered the enemies
they were a decade ago, but they are suspected
suppliers of missile-building goods. Thus, this nation
has to figure out how to neutralize any threat that could
arise if nations such as North Korea or Iraq build and
aim missiles at the United States.
At this point, the Clinton administration's schedule
for designing and testing an anti-missile system, then
deciding whether to deploy it, looks sensible. The 1996
White House agreement with Congress was to test a
national defense by 2000 and, if the threat warrants,
deploy by 2003.
Though an anti-missile system is pricey and not
guaranteed to stop incoming rockets, deployment of a
limited system, at least, could make more sense against
smaller arsenals than it did against the Soviet Union’s.

Letters to the editor

This is the last issue for the Summer and I don't
know what to write.
It happens.
Not that there still aren’t issues burning inside of
me. Even as a child, my favorite thing to say was, “It’s
Danielle not fair." Nothing is ever fair. I said it a lot at nine years;
Belton I still say it, although not in that exact wording at 20. I
kind of miss the issues that weren’t fair at five as
opposed to the issues that aren’t fair now.
At 9, it wasn’t fair that I couldn't leave my backyard, not even
to go into the front yard.
At 20, it isn’t fair that crack laws and cocaine laws are written
differently when they are both derived from the same drug, and
people act as if the law isn’t race-related.
At 9, it wasn’t fair that my oldest sister, Denise, got to have her
own room and 1 had to share a room with the “demon spawn,” my
little sister, Deidre.
At 20, it isn’t fair that people use O.J. Simpson and claim he
somehow caused the gap between the races to grow wider. Joan
Rivers even goes as far as the blame Johnnie Cochran for the current
state of race relations in the this country. The problems this country
have always been there, the trial just made them harder to ignore
than usual.
At 9, it wasn’t fair that I could have that Barbie Doll
Dreamhouse. Everyone else got Barbie’s plastic pink and white
mansion. I got a wooden doll house that was too short so Malibu
Barbie couldn’t stand up in it. She sat down a lot.
At 20, it isn’t fair that people’s views of society are distorted by
television. It’s bad enough outside the western hemisphere that no
one’s heard of a black or hispanic American, and think Americans are
rich, look like David Hasselhof and drive Cadillacs. But many
Americans have the same distorted views about crime, sex and
government because of network news programs. If you only watched
the local news, you’d think crime in St. Louis was at an all time high
instead of a low.
At 9, it wasn’t fair that I had to go to my room. Was it my fault
that I had the meanest mother ever? I wanted a Happy Meal. 1 never
got a Happy Meal. I always got a hamburger and had to split the fries
with my sisters. So I started arguing with her in the car. Did I have
to get sent to my room for her meanness?
At 20, it isn't fair there is still a glass ceiling, although my
classmates and I plan to smash a few.
At 9, it wasn’t fair that I never went over to my best friend’s
house. I only had one friend and I went over her house about eight
times out of our whole friendship. Oh, well, it didn’t last past fourth
grade anyway.
At 20, it isn’t fair that unless you’re a WASP (for those that don’t
know, that stands for white, anglo-saxon, protestant), it’s pretty hard
to become president of the United States. Most people know that
there hasn’t been a black or woman president, but forget there was
only one Catholic, no Italians, few Irish or people that would have
been decendents of immigrants from the 1920s through the second
world war. What does this mean, I wonder? Perhaps, it’s some
leftover McCarthyism hysteria against immigrants that still is
floating around in the 1990s?
But that's just a few points to hold you over until fall.

Gee, will I be the lucky bastard
out of the 45 gagillion who bought
Power Ball tickets this week?
The eight ball says, “Not
bloody likely.”
Yeah, but I bought a ticket
anyway.
I guess a quarter of a billion
dollars would be nice to win,
though. Well, scratch that. It’s
probably more like $120 million
or so. Uncle Sammy gets his cut. I
can only guess the reason the
lottery winnings have gotten this
high is because somebody up there
on Capital Hill needed a quick
$100 million for a study on the
mating habits of former stars of
“Happy Days.”
I shouldn’t be allowed to think
about such things as being
outrageously rich, because my
mind starts to work overtime and
makes a burning rubber smell. I
think about all the things I would
waste money for the first few
minutes, then I start thinking about
all the hassles that would go along
with it:
Having to hire bodyguards
because I know people would
want me dead.
Having to take calls from
distant family and forgotten
friends who want to “catch up.”
Appearing on silly talk shows
and having to answer that all
important question, “What are you
going to do with all that money?”
Like anyone ever tells the truth.
“I’m going to give a lot of it to
charity.” No, no, no! It's more like,
“I'm going to roll around in
hundreds nude. I’m going to buy a
poor village in a third world
country and force the villagers to
perform in off-off-off-Broadway
productions of ‘Kiss Me Kate.’
I’m going to pay Mel Torme to
follow me around and provide
my personal theme music.” More
or less, I’m going to be a
loathsome bastard.
I can’t stand it when some
redneck from Podunk wins a mint
and still lives like trash. Come on,
Jed, pack up the truck and move to
Beverly, man! No, he still delivers
mail every day, just for the heck
of it.
I would pay someone to carry
on my conversations for me. Of
course, that's why I'll never win.

With the loving advice of the
Lifestyle section gone for the
remainder of the summer, what’s
a sad and depraved college
student to do?
Well, your old pal is here
to console you and save you
from countless nights watching
“Smokey and the Bandit” while

off the longest month of the year.
By the way, substitute any one of
these ten for getting your books

1: Go and buy a Slurpee
from 7-11. Normally I try not to

blatantly endorse products, but
when one is sent from the
heavens, as is this frosty treat is,
I cannot resist. Be daring, get a
giant one and mix all the
flavors. (Tip: different 7-11
locations have different flavors.
Sample them all, except for Burnt
Toenail Lime.) The Slurpee is the
cure-all and provides an erotic
orgasmal brain freeze when
sucked down quickly.
2: Check out the “Angels
from the Vatican” display at the
art museum before they fly away.
This way you can always have
something to talk about on that
first day when your hyper history
teacher wants to hear about your
summer vacation.
3: Go and see the sequel of
the year, “Halloween: H20.” It

Jackie Joyner-Kersee prepares fo r h er la st com petition
Saturday night at S IU E ’s Ralph K orte Stadium

Baseball great Ted Williams ended his illustrious career by
hitting a hom erun in his last at bat.
Saturday, Jackie Joyner-Kersee m ay not have hit a “ho m eru n ”
in her long jum p com petition, but she did leave S IU E ’s R alph
Korte Stadium triumphantly.
H er sixth place finish was the last thing the 9,100 spectators on
hand had to give Joyner-Kersee a fond farewell.
But coming off an exhausting victory in the Goodwill Games
heptathlon in New York the w eekend before, Joyner-Kersee
settled for ending her career with grace, style and tears.
“I just wanted to walk away knowing I did my best. I really
didn’t want it to end but I told myself ‘Jackie, you can’t run
forever,”’ Joyner K ersee said em otionally Saturday night.
Joyner-Kersee’s last “hom erun” try landed her 20-11 1/2.
A lm ost four feet shy of her all-time best.
“It wasn’t m eant to be,” Joyner-Kersee said about her long
jum p com petition.
But that didn’t stop spectators from cheering and cam eram en
from snapping pictures. The U.S. Open: Track and Field’s Farewell
to JJK was m eant to celebrate a career, not just the one night.
A nd with tears in her eyes she was happy she was done with
her track and field career.
“I ’m glad,” Joyner K ersee said. “I have no regrets.”
And regrets she shouldn’t:
♦ She won six Olym pic medals, including golds in the
heptathlon in 1988 and 1992 and the long jum p in 1988.

Above all, Joyner-Kersee
is a class act to follow

SPORTS E D IT O R
O ne of the most frequent statem ents
made about Jackie Joyner-Kersee is how
much of a wonderful person she is.
“This is Jackie’s night, and I will gladly
be second string to her,” Reggie Torian
said after he won the 110-meter hurdles.
“She is one of the greatest who has ever
com peted.”
Friend and com petitor Gail Devers
said, “She lives as an example of a caring
selfless person.”

H usband Bob Kersee and Jackie plan
to help rebuild East. St. Louis, and hope to
bring a track and field event to this area
each year.
“We are going to be working hard in
this area,” Kersee said. “We want to bring
a track m eet here year after year. So
[Jackie] might be retiring but she is never
going to quit.”
Joyner-Kersee will always be adm ired
by the m edia, her com petitors and fans for
the things she does on and off the field.
The St. Louis area can only benefit by
having her around full-time.

ST. LOUIS (A P) — The closer Mark McGwire gets to the single­
season home run record, the m ore valuable the slugger’s
autograph on bats, balls and baseball cards is becoming — and
the more frequently forgeries are appearing in stores across
the country.
Phony McGwire autographs have turned up in at least five
places in the past month. A t two of them, stores in D enver and St.
Louis, McGwire pointed the forgeries out to store employees
himself, said M cGwire’s business agent, Jim Milner.
“I have heard there may be a ton of this stuff out there,”
Milner said. “[McGwire] wants people to know that if they spend
money on this stuff, it’s bogus.”

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (A P) — Anaheim Angels closer Troy
Percival, who leads the A L with 29 saves, was taken to a hospital
Saturday after complaining of dizziness for the third time in
three days.
Percival saw a neurologist at St. Luke’s Hospital, the Angels
said, but results of the examination were not im mediately
available. A naheim m anager Terry Collins said he did not know
if Percival would be hospitalized overnight.
Collins said Percival first complained of dizziness Thursday,
both before and after pitching against M innesota for his 29th
save. H e w as-taken to the hospital shortly after arriving at
Kauffman Stadium on Saturday.

Athletes enjoy consecutive U.S. events
■ TODD SPANN
SPORTS E D IT O R
Throughout a norm al track and
field season, a world class athlete
will com pete in events all over the
globe, and consecutive events
usually are separated by a big
body of water.
B ut the trav el betw een the
Goodwill G am es and the Farewell
to JJK have been easy to handle
for some athletes who have made
the trip.
“I t’s very nice. I wish we could
do this all the time,” USA sprinter
Inger Miller said after her win in
the 100-m eter dash Saturday
night. “We get m ore rest and we
eat good.”
Traveling across the world
can take it’s toll on an athlete,
and when U.S. athletes have the
opportunity to stay in th eir
country, they enjoy it.
“I wish they would start a track
and field circuit in the U.S.” 400Bob Fehringer/A/esf/e
m eter hurdler B rian B ronson said.
Kim berly B ecker o f the USA attem pts the p o le vault
“It gives us a chance to rest.”
S a turda y n igh t a t the US Open.
The night was topped off by
running an O lym pic torch
around the track w ith the
Lincoln H igh School track
team.
The w orld will rem em ber
Joyner-Kersee as a fighter and
last w eek at th e G oodw ill
Games is a prim e example.
She hadn’t participated in the
heptathlon in over two years
and despite w hat critics said, she
gutted through it.
She
won
h er
fourth
consecutive G oodw ill G am es
gold medal with 6,502 points,

She may be retiring but she

SIU E is on top of the World.
All eyes were on Jackie JoynerK ersee’s farewell event last w eekend,
and now SIU E is hosting the World
B oom erang Championships.
“It’s awesome,” John Flynn of the
U SA team said Monday, during the
first day of competition.
Every two years the boom erang
cham pionship is held, and a new
location is picked.
In 1996, New Z ealand had the

held it. Australia will be the site of the
2000 championship.
A nd this year St. Louis was picked.
“ [SIU E] offered two things,”
organizer Tom Fitzgerald said. “An

universities do n ’t have the space, and
as you can see we use up a lot.”
The championship will be going on
all week at the soccer fields outside
Ralph Korte Stadium.
There will be seven team events
going on through the week, and then
on Friday and S aturday individual
events are held.
Events range from accuracy tests to
trick catch tests.
M ost of the action starts at 9 a.m.

Mike Montgomery, a Mass Communications instructor at SIUE, edits
a story written by a journalism camper. This is the first time that
Journalism Camp has been offered on the campus of SIUE. Fourteen
area high school journalists participated in the camp.
Monday, July 20, marked
the first day of the SIUE
Summer Journalism Camp.
The class met from 9 a.m. to
noon from July 20 to
July 31.
Mike Montgomery, an
SIUE Mass Communication
instructor, and Annice Brave,
an Alton High School
journalism teacher, co-taught
the class of 14 future
reporters, photographers and
broadcast journalists. The
class is writing for the Alestle,
the campus newspaper, and
the Edwardsville Intelligencer.
Montgomery, 52, has been
in news reporting for more
than 20 years and a college
instructor for four years.
Montgomery wants to push
kids toward journalism and the
media so they can inform
people all over the world
about news and make this
country a better place.
Montgomery said, “I
really believe in the First
Amendment, and if we can
get people to believe in truth,
justice, and the American Way,
we can make this country a
lot better.”

Annice Brave, 46, a
teacher for 12 years, suggested
to Montgomery that SIUE
needed a summer journalism
camp when he was a guest
lecturer for her class. Brave,
who has her undergraduate
degree in Mass
Communications and worked
in public relations before she
started teaching,, said the camp
is “ a fun way to introduce kids
into journalism.”
Alison Dreith, 17, from
Alton High, said, “It’s a
good experience that will
help students get their foot
in the door to other
journalism programs.”
Mark Wonnacott, 13, from
Belleville, expressed his
opinion about the journalism
program. “It’s been a lot of
fun. It’s not just work, it’s
work you want to do.”
Dr. Ralph Donald, the
chair of the Mass
Communications Department,
said he believes such camps
should be conducted by
universities. “One of the most
important things a department
like us should do is practice in
outreach.”

HUMOR ON CAMPUS
by Kurt Thomas
During the first week of the SIUE Summer
Journalism Camp, I had a chance to talk with the
students and instructors. Some of the things that
I heard were surprising, and some were quite
funny.
One student, who obviously likes politics
and government, expressed this observation:
If “con” is the opposite of “pro,” does that
mean that Congress is the opposite of progress?
We also discussed good English, which can
be confusing.
Why do we drive on a parkway and park in
a driveway?
How come cargo goes by ship and a
shipment goes by truck?

ednesday,

J uly 2 9 , 1 9 9 8 ♦

How can a slim chance and a fat chance be
the same thing?
Why do we call them apartments when they
are all stuck together?
During our discussion on photography, the
following joke came up about color:
If you choke a Smurf, what color will it
turn?
We also got into some wild discussions.
One student posed the following question:
If your knees were bent the other way, what
would a chair look like?
We looked at current events, and there were
lots of articles on divorces and marriage
problems. A student brought up this joke about
matrimony:
Marriage is the only “war” where you sleep
with the “enemy.”

WASHINGTON
(OPINION)
by A.J. Harshbarger

THEATER
by A.J. Harshbarger
and Jennifer Wilson

When you’re a little kid, you
really don’t care what goes on in
Washington or how the people
there conduct their business. You
sometimes watched the news
with your parents, not quite
understanding what they are
talking about.
But now, as aspiring young
adults, we learn that everything
done in Washington affects us.
From the changes in the
minimum wage to the tax hikes,
it all affects us. So you would
think that there would be
something else going on besides
this whole Lewinski Whitewater thing. Is this the
only thing our nation’s
journalists can find to cover?
Who really gives a care if
President Clinton had an affair
with this woman? Nobody, at
least not most of the nation’s
population.
The only ones who care are
the Repulicans looking to dig up
dirt on the president. If the
president did have an affair, will
that change the way he governs
our great democracy? Probably
not. What people do in their
personal lives has nothing to do
with what they do for a living.
Everyone knows that presidents
have had mistresses and affairs
with other women behind their
wives’ backs. I’m not saying it’s
right, but it’s to be expected.
You cannot honestly think
that the president is completely
innocent. If he obstructed justice
and participated in a land deal
gone bad, then he should be
investigated by the Senate
Judiciary Committee. But we all
must realize, that his term will
be ending in the year 2000. If the
Kenneth Starr grand jury goes at
the pace it has been going over
the past couple of months, we
won’t know anything for a
long time.
So instead of worry about
the president’s booty calls, we
should be worrying about the
United States expanding trade
with China or reducing spending
on less important items. Let’s
just leave the personal life of
such highly respected public
figures like the president alone
and get on with the real news of
the world.

SIUE’s theater department is rolling with enthusiasm after just
completing the summer musicals, “The Music Man” and
“Brigadoon.” The productions received good reviews from papers
such as the Alton Telegraph and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Chairman of theater operations, W. Craven Mackie said he is
proud of the performers and excited about the upcoming productions.
“What drives people to act is that you are able to create
characters and really make them come alive,” Mackie explained
about his students’ interest in the theater. “Here, all of the students
get an opportunity to act.”
Anyone can act in a theatrical performance at SIUE. Mackie said
that one of every five performers is not a theater major. For that
matter, actors don’t even have to be students.
With so many opportunities in the University Theater, anyone
can try out for the upcoming performances this school year. In
October, the serious comedic Broadway play, “Blue Window,” will
be on the main stage, followed by “Dance in Concert ’98” in
November. In February, the department will be showing “Italian
American Reconciliation.” Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” will be featured
in April.
“We’ve done some outstanding Shakespeare productions over
the years,” Mackie said. The theater department will look into
carrying that streak through next year, he said.
In this age of Hollywood productions and the small - screen
success of many actors, some people may question the future of
American theater.
According to Mackie, stage performances will be around for a
long time. “I think there is a lot of interest in [the theater],” he said.
“There are still 300 Broadway theaters, plus another 200 offBroadway theaters just in New York City.”
Broadway refers to New York’s Broadway, where some of the
world’s finest actors perform.
To be an actor or an actress, it takes talent, determination and
respect for those who have come before. Mackie said, “It opens a
world of creativity. There is no end to the challenge.”

Cross Country Individual
And Team Camp

The cross country campers sprint toward success at SIUE. The camp
was held from July 20 to July 23 at the Ralph Korte Stadium.
Each year SIUE offers a
variety of summer camps, from
nursing to Nike Sports camps.
Gregory Conroy, assistant
director of public affairs at
SIUE, reported that this
summer’s Varsity Basketball
Camp had a record attendence
of more than 200 participants,
making it possibly the most
attended camp this summer. The
newest program this summer
was Journalism Camp offered
by Michael Montgomery and
Annice Brave.
Journalism camper Kurt
Thomas, 16, of Edwardsville,
reported that the heat “made it
miserable to go outside and do
anything.” All week, campers
have had to endure over 95degree temperatures. “I’ve got a
cold from being in the air
conditioning all day. Now I
can’t stop blowing my nose,”
17-year-old Alison Dreith, of

Alton, said.
Some campers have had the
advantages of being in the air
conditioning all day while
attending camps such as
nursing, journalism and art
workshops. Other camps such as
the Volleyball Individual Skills
Camp and the Cross Country
Individual and Team Camps had
to endure the heat.

Volleyball Individual
Skills Camp
From July 20 through 22,
from 9 to 11:30 a.m., Sandy
Montgomery, SIUE head
volleyball coach, taught the
Volleyball Individual Skills
Camp. “We had 33 kids,
grades 6 through 12,”
Montgomery reported.
Sarah Beck, 11, from
Grantfork Elementary said, “It
was fun and I learned a lot. I
learned how to spike hard.”
Claire Alyea, 11, from Saint

Darryl Frerker, head Track
and Field coach at SIUE, along
with assistant coach Kenny
Hammel, held the Cross Country
Individual and Team Camp July
20 through 24 from 7 to 9 a.m.
There were 18 runners attending
the camp, and they mostly ran
on campus trails and up hills.
Frerker mostly focused on
running form and motiviation.
He also talked about setting
goals, hydration, resisting drugs
and alcohol, weight lifting and
eligibility.
Amy Semith, 16, of
Edwardsville said, “I thought it
was good. It helped me get out
and get my miles back.”
Amy has been running both
track and cross country at
Edwardsville since her freshman
year. She will be a senior this
coming school year.
Dustin Talleur, 16, of
Highland said, “It made me get
out and start to run my miles. It
made the summer interesting.”
Dustin is the number one
runner at his school. He has
been involved since seventh
grade in both cross country and
track. He will also be a senior.
Frerker focused on running
form and motiviation. Frerker
said, “It wasn’t too hot for me
because I wasn’t the one doing
the running. But the campers
were pretty hot the first three

days of camp.”

Odyssey Camp
Virginia Bryan, director of
the office of science and
mathematics, held the Odyssey
Camps on June 15-26 and on
July 6-17. There were two
sessions for campers age 7-15.
Both sessions focused on
general and life science.
Campers disected owl pellets,
made slime and appeared on
television. Also, Bryran gave a
program on chemistry. For the
advanced students, there were
levels three and four. Level
three focused on life science,
bending glass, analysis and
chemistry. Level four
concentrated on aerodynamics,
by making and shooting off
rockets. The heat did not affect
the campers because the last day
of the camps was July 17,
before the record heat arrived.

Nurse Camp
Lorraine Williams, assistant
professor of nursing and director

♦

of Project GAIN, Getting Active
in Nursing, directed the Nurse
Camp June 8-July 17. There
were 32 students In four levels.
This unique program is for
students interested in a career in
nursing. Students volunteered in
hospitals and took different
classes. Each year the students
come back to move on to the
next level.
The camp includes
enhancing basic knowledge in
many subjects such as math,
science, reading and computers.
Williams said, “We even had
one girl increase her math skills
from basic math to
trigonometry!” At the end of the
week, there was an outstanding
awards program where many of
the students were recognized.
Campers from all over the
area have dealt with the record
heat all week, but they all
managed to have fun and learn a
lot. All the camps this summer
at SIUE were a great success.

August and feels that the campus keeps getting safer all the time.
“The police force has increased signifigantly over the years,”
Anderson said.
Anderson noted that a survey taken in May 1997 showed that
98.3 percent of the students feel safe on the SIUE campus.
Advice from a police sergeant might make you feel safer. Sgt.
Tim Penwell says that being aware of your surroundings and being
cautious are the most important tips in keeping safe. "The increase
in campus police has helped significantly in campus safety,”
Penwell said. Crime has decreased in the past year, and Penwell
said he believes it has a lot to do with students being cautious.
“Please call, have good communication and don’t be afraid,”
Penwell said.
Heather Mueller and Kim Deppe, juniors at SIUE, said they
feel that the campus is a pretty safe place, and the police are
patrolling it very well. Mueller said she believes that the police are
giving good advice in protecting students fromcrime. There are
services to call that can escort you or help you in any way if
needed,” Mueller explained.
Deppe said the campus police are very proactive. She said she
believes the police prevent crimes by always being alert. Deppe
said she believes there are a few too many parking tickets handed
out. For instance, she said, parking on the wrong lot for about 30
minutes and coming out to find a ticket on your windshield.
Anderson believes a problem is the parking lots being closed
from time to time. “There are notices on campus, but most students
just don't see them,” Anderson said. "This is where the parking
lots become a problem.”
Ken Neher, vice chancelor for administration, said, “The
police force is very good and crime has decreased 40 percent in the
past year.” Neher said he believes crime will continue to go down.
As with any large community, the SIUE campus does have
problems. But as the police said, be aware of everything around
you and you'll be fine.

Playing it safe!
Tracey Bishop of Troy waits her
turn at a pedestrian crosswalk
on the campus of SIUE. Bishop
was a participant in the SIUE
Journalism Camp, a program
for area high school journalists.
According to the students
at SIUE, our beloved
Edwardsville campus is safe
and thankfully boring. Safety
is just one of the benefits of
living in a small Illinois
community. That does not
make for an especially
interesting news story, but at
least it is reassuring.
Here are the facts about
safety on the Edwardsville
campus, from college
students. The general opinion
from the student body is that
the SIUE police are a warning
presence to anyone who may
be stupid enough to commit a
crime on a well-lit campus.
The police force is not a
frantic group busy with
murders and robberies.
The SIUE police are
mostly busy trying to protect
us from the dangers of

driving just a little too fast
so they will not miss class.
Just ask the opinion of any
student who has found a
parking ticket slipped
discreetly underneath a
windshield wiper, or some
poor soul who has just
been pulled over for going
an extreme 35 mph in a
30 mph zone.
SIUE is almost as
perfect as can be, but not
without its own slight
criminal activity. Sgt. Tim
Penwell of the SIUE police
says that the crime rate has
dropped almost 40 percent
since last year. Penwell says
that the decrease is because
of the addition of 10 officers
to the force, new well-lit
parking lots and trails and
emergency phones found all
over campus.
There are now police
officers in cars, on bikes and
on foot around the campus.
Bill Anderson, Student
Senate president, says that
the police are a threat to
deter crimes from taking
place. He also says that the
students work well with the
police to report problems
on campus.,
Still there are a few
thefts around campus, mostly
from cars. Here are some
practical tips for the
vulnerable. Ken Neher, vice
chancellor for administration
at SIUE, tells students to
keep things like CD players
and cell phones out of view
in their parked cars. This is
so a bored thief will not be
tempted. Never leave your
belongings unattended, even
for a minute. Students should
travel in groups, especially at
night, and stay away from
possibly threatening
situations.
Kim Deppe, a junior,
says that most of the crime
occurs in Cougar Village
where cars stay overnight
and are more vulnerable. She
also says that police are
doing the best that they can
to keep the campus safe.
A survey of the students
in May 1997 found that 98.3
percent feel safe on campus.
For the other 1.7 percent,
there are self defense classes
and special groups on
campus that anyone can join.
There is always going to
be some crime because this
is not a perfect world, but the
SIUE police will not give up
the fight.

On SIUE, crime doesn’t seem to be a big problem. After a lot of
digging, I found that SIUE seems pretty safe.
The people I interviewed said some of the problems come from
people locking their keys in their cars, parking lots being too far
away, cars being broken into and parking tickets. One student I
talked to thinks that some of the problems aren’t with the students
on campus, but with outsiders.
Some members of Student Government claim that in order to
lower crime, students need to get more involved with clubs and
activities. Finance Board Chair for Student Government Heather
Mueller said the student government is trying to increase
involvement by helping with the funds to have guest speakers
and festivals.
The students I interviewed say they feel safe on campus. They
say the police force is to thank for that. Student Kim Deppe says the
police are able to respond correctly to problems because they have
been trained and are ready for any kind of situation.
Let’s say you're out in the middle of a dark and deserted
parking lot and you don’t feel safe. No problem. You can go to a
nearby emergency box and call for help. If you don’t feel safe going
out alone in the first place, call for a police escort. An officer will
make sure that you get to your car or dorm safely.
Sgt. Tim Penwell says that more people are feeling safe on
campus due to escorts, emergency boxes and just knowing that the
police are around to ensure their safety. Students just need to
cooperate and follow a few simple suggestions.
Some tips to consider:
• Travel in groups
• Park in a well-lit area
• Remove valuables from sight in cars (cell phones, purses, cd
players, etc.)
• Don’t drive drunk
• Be careful about who you let into your apartment
• If something doesn’t feel right, it’s not
• Call the police if you see someone lurking in the bushes or any
suspicious place
• Don’t put yourself in an akward situation
• Learn to say no
• Attend safety classes or meetings
Remember, the police are there for you when you need them.

I Have My Mother’s
Thighs, And I Have To
Accept That
by Heather Fprry
With commercials featuring
comments like this, Kellogg’s
Special K cereal has introduced a
“Reshape Your Attitude”
campaign to let women know
that there isn’t an ideal height
and weight for females.
Although many would like to
be as thin as some women
portrayed in the media today,
weighing 115 pounds isn’t
necessary to be “beautiful.”
Everyone’s goal should be to
become physically fit. After all,
being fit leads to a more shapely
body, whether it’s a size 2 or 20.
Women who have accepted this
fact and their bodies are to be
greatly admired.
Jamie Lannen, a
lifeguard/supervisor at Cougar
Lake Pool, points out that most
women “inadvertantly bring
attention to their flaws by
covering their stomachs with
their hands or covering
themselves with towels right
away when they’re in a
bathing suit.”
Katie VanHook, also a
lifeguard at Cougar Lake Pool,
admires the casting of Kate
Winslet in the hit movie
“Titanic.” She says that for once
a person of “normal size” was
cast to play a beautiful woman.

Taking The Plunge.
Practice makes perfect for 3-yearold Brian Lynch, a resident of
Edwardsville, as he attends swim
lessons at SIUE’s Cougar Lake
Pool. Unlike many teens and
adults, Brian doesn’t mind posing
for picture in his bathing suit. His
anxious look is due to his dislike of
going underwater.
She also says, “It shouldn’t
matter what we look like, but
how we feel about ourselves.
Self-esteem is very important.”
One Special K commercial
features guys in a bar saying
things like, “Do these pants
make my butt look big?”
Remarks like these are
humiliatingly well known to
mosi women around the world.
One comment in the commercial
gives fabulous advice. “I will
not let my self-worth be
determined by my dress size.”
Maybe television can teach us a
thing or two after all.

MRF to be
commemorated in
March
by Alison Dreith
During the 1970s, sex,
drugs and rock ‘n ’ roll were
not strangers at the
Mississippi River Festival.
Those days are gone, leaving
only memories. But MRF
fans will have a chance to
flash back to those days
when Southern Illinois
University Edwardsville held
the hundreds of music shows.
An exhibit celebrating
the 30th anniversity of the
MRF will be at the SIUE
Campus Museum in the
University Center.
Photographs of the festival
will be featured. The exhibit
is set to open in March.
For nine years, SIUE
entertained the world through
the Mississippi River
Festival. More than 300
acts captured more than
2 million hearts.
Many people remember
what it was like and now
share their memories with
their children. They
sometimes wonder why the
concerts ever stopped.
“There really is no
simple answer,” Lyle Ward,
assistant director of the
University Center, said.
“Reason one: the death of
John Rendleman, second
president of the university.”
According to Ward,
Rendleman was the spark
behind the festival. Bad
public perceptions along with
the expenses were also major
factors in the decision to stop
the festival.
Still another reason was
offered by Annice Brave, a
University News Service
reporter during MRF days.
“It was tough for the
university to handle a big
concert promotion. It’s better
off handled by the private
sector,” Brave said.
Music at the MRF
ranged from classical to rock.
Ward recalled having the
premire conductors of the
world at SIUE as some of
the MRF’s big attractions.
But there were performances
by Janis Joplin and The
Eagles, who appeared more
than once.
“One of the most
dramatic things was when
The Band’s lead singer, Bob
Dylan, made his first live
performance after a car
wreck, and appeared without
anyone knowing he would be
here,” Ward said.
People interested in the
history of rock ‘n’ roll, or just
local history, are sure to
appreciate the MRF 30th
anniversary exhibit.

The Only One of
Its Kind
by Gretchen Moore
Twenty-seven years ago,
the idea of building a geodesic
dome seemed improbable.
R. Buckminster Fuller, a former
SIUE faculty member, had the
idea of building a globe that
could be unfolded into one flat
piece with no distortion. Even
the Encyclopedia Britannica had
said that feat was impossible.
But, Fuller made the dome a
reality when he built it on the
SIUE campus.
The Religious Center that
proudly displays Fuller’s dome
sits on the 19th western
meridian line of longitude. All
of the land masses appear on the
huge globe except for Australia
and the South Pole. But when
looking at the transparent
replica of the globe from the
inside, something seems to be
wrong with the shape of the
continents. They’re all
backwards! This is most
noticable where the boot of Italy
is found facing the right instead
of the left.
Fuller received no funding
from SIUE to build the

Looking out on the world.
The SIUE Religious Center is
one of the most recognizable
structures on the campus.
R. Buckminister Fuller, creator of
the building, built the geodesic
dome with no financial support
from SIUE. It has remained an
attraction throughout its 27 years.

The continents on the globe can be

magnificent structure. All of the
money was donated by local
churches. So the Religious
Center is not actually
considered part of the SIUE
campus, yet still remains closely
related. It has, in turn, ended up
to be a unique building on the
grounds of the college.
The dome may be the most
recognizable structure on
campus, but the building below
it is a significant help to many
students. The Religious Center
has more than 20 activities
that people can take part in.
Daily activities include worship

services, Bible studies, prayer
time and social activities
for students.
There are many rooms in the
Religious Center. A full-sized
kitchen is available to those
students who wish to prepare a
meal, but they are encouraged to
wash the dishes when they are
through. A study area is open for
those who want some quiet time
to take a nap or study (especially
during finals week.) There are
also meeting rooms, offices,
prayer rooms and a library. The
main room is also used for
weddings, funerals, speakers and

FAIR
by Mark Wonnacott
Hail, lords and ladies of the land. Seeketh thee entertainment medieval? Cometh
then to the Renaissance Festival at Tower Lake Recreational Facility on the Southern
Illinois University, Edwardsville campus. The fair opened July 25 and 26, and will
occur again on August 1 and 2.
Produced by Aries Entertainment Group, the fair offers fun and education.
Armored combat, in the style of medieval knights, is offered along with bards and
minstrels singing the combatants’ praises. Renaissance actors and actresses perform
dramas of the age. The young nobles may be brought before the king and queen and
dubbed Ladies in Waiting or Knights of the Round.
One of the calligraphers and medieval musicians, Ken Woods, or Gianetto Bello,
as he prefers to be called, plays a wide variety of medival instruments like recorders
and the Rebec, which is a stringed instrument resembling a fiddle. He plays what he
calls “Top 10 music from the late Medieval and early Renaissance.” He also explains
to his audience a bit about each of his instruments.
Woods’ interest in times long gone was kindled in a Shakespeare class. He heard
the line, “the clown sings.” But Woods said, “No one seemed to know what he sang.”
Woods said that he wanted to know and began his study of long-ago lifestlyes. He

church services.
The Religious Center is
home to several ministries such
as Catholic, Methodist,
Presbyterian, Baptist and more.
The ministers are often
considered as close friends or a
part of the family by those in
need, according to the Rev.
Bryan Manary, American
Baptist campus minister.
“I love making a difference
in young people’s lives. Helping
them with problems and issues
is very satisfing, “Manary said.”
“When I was a freshman, I was
having some difficult times. I

got help, and from then on I
knew that ministry was what
God wanted for me.”
R. Buckminster Fuller
defeated all of the obstacles that
stood in his way when he was
trying to reach his dream of
building his geodesic dome.
And it seems that his attitude
still lives in the hearts of the
people who visit the Religious
Center today, helping them
overcome the obstacles of their
everyday lives.

even picked up the recorder so he could find out what this music sounded like.
This Renaisance Fair is a first at SIUE. Verna Atkins, the actress playing the queen
at the festival, said, “First town shows are always more fun. They seem to have such a
fresh, warm spirit. “
Her beginning as a Renaissance actress was in Kansas in 1982. Her son, then a
sophomore in high school, auditioned for a Renaissance festival. The whole family
went along. Atkins said, “ We didn’t know what we were getting into. They liked our
work and wouldn’t let us leave until we had all auditioned. They put us in a shop
selling T-shirts and such. I’ve worked my way up and played all the roles.”
She has been playing the queen for the past five years at shows throughout the
Midwest. One year she played a Spanish queen, who wore a lot of heavy velvet. The
experience left her with some advice for others. As an actress who wears clothing
meant for a much cooler climate, she gave several tips on how people can beat the heat.
Drink plenty of water, sit in the shade whenever possible, stay away from fried or spicy
foods, but be sure to eat. Atkins said that fruit, chicken, turkey or cheese are good,
light fare.

well, traveler, and may your way lead thee to our grandest of fairs.

Sports Camps

Out of the Ordinary

by Heather Ferry

World-class boomerang
throwers, (left to right) Lorenz
Gubler, Manuel Schütz, Jurg
Schedler, and Thomas
Stehrenberger, don’t play the
average sport. These Swiss team
members will be representing
their country in the World
Boomerang Championships on
the campus of SIUE. Schütz is
currently the world record
holder for distance.

SIUE sports camps give young athletes extensive coaching
and training, as well as opportunities to learn new skills and
participate in competitions.
Most camps take place in the Sam M. Vadalabene Center
for Health, Recreation and Physical Education and the SIUE
Olympic Festival Track and Field Stadium. Sports
camps include baseball, softball, boys and girls basketball,
cross country, track and field, soccer, tennis, volleyball
and wrestling.
The Volleyball Individual Skills Camp went
“wonderfully,” Coach Sandy Montgomery said. 33 students
between grades 6 and 12 attended the camp from July 20
through the 22.
Brochures on all the camps can be found on the campus in
the Conferences and Institutes Office of the University Center.
Although most camps are over for the summer, they will be
offered again next year.
During the school year, students attending the college can
chose from 15 different sports, according to Eric Hess, SIUE’s
sports information director. Hess said there are several hundred
students participating in these sports each year. According to
coaches and teachers, student participation in sports helps keep
youngsters in school and out of trouble.

Championships approach,
