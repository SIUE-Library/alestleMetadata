In a ceremony on April 18 at
12:30 p.m., in the M eridian
Ballroom, Colony Theta of Delta
Phi Epsilon International will
receive their charter and become
the Gamma Alpha Chapter.
The reception will include
guest speaker Cheryl Lamb from
the international chapter. Delta
Phi Epsilon is the first sorority at
SIUE to achieve this goal in over
20 years.
Phil Parrish, who has served
as university advisor of the

sorority for the past nine months
said sorority members have
undergone an extensive colony
program over the last 18 months.
“Delta Phi Epsilon has
participated in a num ber of
community service activities,
volunteerism ,
recruitm ent,
leadership activities, scholarship
and workshopsin order to receive
their charter,” Parrish said.
Some of their volunteer
projects include: cystic fibrosis,
the
education
foundation,
anorexia nervosa and other eating
disorders.
Founded in 1917 at New
York Law School, Delta Phi
Epsilon was form ed “for the

purpose o f prom oting good
fellow ship
am ong
sorority
women.” The first chapter was
chartered in 1922 at McGill
University in Montreal Quebec.
The five founders were Dorthy
Cohen Schartzman, Ida Binstock
Landau,
M inna
Goldsmith
Mahler, Sylvia Steirman Cohen
and Eva Effin Robin.
The
main
benefit
of
chartering is that Delta Phi
Episilon
will
finally
be
recognized as a sorority on
campus.
“We
will %finally
be
recognized as a chapter.” said
Toni Schneider, president of
Delta Phi Epsilon.

B eginning in the fall of
1999, undergraduate students on
the campuses of SIUE and SIUC
will pay three percent more for
tuition, fees and room and board.
The decision to increase
tuition and room and board came
at a meeting of the board of
trustees at S IU ’s School of
Medicine, on April 9. The Board
reviewed changes which are part
of the university’s ongoing fouryear tuition and fee plan.
SIU president, Ted Sanders
said the board’s proposed three
percent increased was linked
with the Consumer Price Index of
3.1 percent and is slightly below
the 3.1 percent annual estimate
that economists have projected.
Full-tim e
undergraduates
on the SIUC cam pus with a
roommate will pay $84 more
per academic year in tuition,
$31 more for fees and $112
more for room and board,
averaging costs to $7,824.80, an
increase of $227.
Other fees included in the
scheduled tuition and fees
increase for the 1999 academic

year, on the SIU C campus
include: an additional $20 per
academic year for intercollegiate
athletics, an additional $2 for
the mass transit fee, an additional
$2 fee for student center and
an $7 increase for on-campus
health care.
Full-time undergraduates on
the SIUE campus will pay $62.40
more in tuition, $17.50 more for
fees and $122 more for room and
board, averaging $6,932.30, an
increase of $202.
Additional fees that will go
in effect in the 1999 school year
include: a 50 cent hike in the
student welfare and activity fee,
$4 more for the textbook rental
fee, $10 for the University Center
fee, 50 cents more for the
Student-to-Student G rant fee,
and a $3 increase for the Student

McGinley---------from page 10
It was Eric Bruskotter, one of the
co-stars of the film , whom I
interviewed earlier.]
He was complimenting my
hair earlier.
It is kind of nice. Do you put
a hat on it?
No I don’t.
We were all kind of wishing
Eric could wear a hat once in a
while. Who knows, I don’t even
know if I have a good sense of
comedy yet. I can wish.
W hat’s m ore boring to
watch on television, g o lf or
baseball?
It depends what it is. I like to
watch golf if it’s the M asters or
something. You can forego any
baseball game to w atch the
Masters. Then you have to switch

back to the ballgam e. I ’m a
hockey man. That’s all I care
about. I am a Dodgers fan,
though.
How much freedom do you
think celebrities should have to
sacrifice?
Someone like me, I don’t do
publicity in general, I have all I
want. I don’t want any more. I
don’t need more. I don’t seek it.
In that sense, for me, it’s different
than someone w ho’s out there on
a daily basis. They want to be
seen. You’re putting yourself out
there, you’re going to lose a great
deal of freedom. The problem
with me, as a celebrity, is I used
to be able to go to a bar or a park
and
ju st
watch
people.
Observation is one of the major
keys in acting. And you lose that
freedom. The thing that I miss the
most is that sense of obscurity
and the ability to blend in. Again,

A l e s t l e

if you’re going to take all the
goods, you’ve got be willing to
step up to bat. For me, it’s just
right.
Do you ever get star struck
anymore?
Meeting Ozzie Smith for me.
And I’ve met a lot of people. I
met Cary Grant, which for me,
was huge. But I was too
embarrassed to be introduced.
Were you surprised at all
about
the
longevity
of
“Married with Children?”
By the time I got to it, it was
so popular. I was surprised
because I had never seen it before
I got on it. I was like, “Wow.
What is this thing?” Then I got
how important it was in a weird
way. Now, internationally, that
show is huge. In countries you
can’t imagine: Israel, Australia,
Germany; gigantic! I get way
more mail from Europe than I do

T hursday, A p ril

from the United States.
Was there anything risque
on the show that you didn’t
want to do?
No. One time, in the main
titles, we had a girl on top of a
table. I was just supposed to be
looking at her legs. No
underwear. So, I’m just supposed
to look up at her with no
underwear. It was one of the
greatest days of my life. If it was
too risque, I w
