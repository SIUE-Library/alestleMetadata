NF.WS STRINGER
In a ceremony on April 18 at
12:30 p.m., in the M eridian
Ballroom, Colony Theta of Delta
Phi Epsilon International will
receive their charter and become
the Gamma Alpha Chapter.
The reception will include
guest speaker Cheryl Lamb from
the international chapter. Delta
Phi Epsilon is the first sorority at
SIUE to achieve this goal in over
20 years.
Phil Parrish, who has served
as university advisor of the

sorority for the past nine months
said sorority members have
undergone an extensive colony
program over the last 18 months.
“Delta Phi Epsilon has
participated in a num ber of
community service activities,
volunteerism ,
recruitm ent,
leadership activities, scholarship
and workshopsin order to receive
their charter,” Parrish said.
Some of their volunteer
projects include: cystic fibrosis,
the
education
foundation,
anorexia nervosa and other eating
disorders.
Founded in 1917 at New
York Law School, Delta Phi
Epsilon was form ed “for the

purpose o f prom oting good
fellow ship
am ong
sorority
women.” The first chapter was
chartered in 1922 at McGill
University in Montreal Quebec.
The five founders were Dorthy
Cohen Schartzman, Ida Binstock
Landau,
M inna
Goldsmith
Mahler, Sylvia Steirman Cohen
and Eva Effin Robin.
The
main
benefit
of
chartering is that Delta Phi
Episilon
will
finally
be
recognized as a sorority on
campus.
“We
will %finally
be
recognized as a chapter.” said
Toni Schneider, president of
Delta Phi Epsilon.

B eginning in the fall of
1999, undergraduate students on
the campuses of SIUE and SIUC
will pay three percent more for
tuition, fees and room and board.
The decision to increase
tuition and room and board came
at a meeting of the board of
trustees at S IU ’s School of
Medicine, on April 9. The Board
reviewed changes which are part
of the university’s ongoing fouryear tuition and fee plan.
SIU president, Ted Sanders
said the board’s proposed three
percent increased was linked
with the Consumer Price Index of
3.1 percent and is slightly below
the 3.1 percent annual estimate
that economists have projected.
Full-tim e
undergraduates
on the SIUC cam pus with a
roommate will pay $84 more
per academic year in tuition,
$31 more for fees and $112
more for room and board,
averaging costs to $7,824.80, an
increase of $227.
Other fees included in the
scheduled tuition and fees
increase for the 1999 academic

year, on the SIU C campus
include: an additional $20 per
academic year for intercollegiate
athletics, an additional $2 for
the mass transit fee, an additional
$2 fee for student center and
an $7 increase for on-campus
health care.
Full-time undergraduates on
the SIUE campus will pay $62.40
more in tuition, $17.50 more for
fees and $122 more for room and
board, averaging $6,932.30, an
increase of $202.
Additional fees that will go
in effect in the 1999 school year
include: a 50 cent hike in the
student welfare and activity fee,
$4 more for the textbook rental
fee, $10 for the University Center
fee, 50 cents more for the
Student-to-Student G rant fee,
and a $3 increase for the Student
Fitness Center fee.
Students
attending
the
School o f Law on the SIUC
cam pus will pay a total of
$5,864, and increase of $211.
Students
attending

It was Eric Bruskotter, one of the
co-stars of the film , whom I
interviewed earlier.]
He was complimenting my
hair earlier.
It is kind of nice. Do you put
a hat on it?
No I don’t.
We were all kind of wishing
Eric could wear a hat once in a
while. Who knows, I don’t even
know if I have a good sense of
comedy yet. I can wish.
W hat’s m ore boring to
watch on television, g o lf or
baseball?
It depends what it is. I like to
watch golf if it’s the M asters or
something. You can forego any
baseball game to w atch the
Masters. Then you have to switch

back to the ballgam e. I ’m a
hockey man. That’s all I care
about. I am a Dodgers fan,
though.
How much freedom do you
think celebrities should have to
sacrifice?
Someone like me, I don’t do
publicity in general, I have all I
want. I don’t want any more. I
don’t need more. I don’t seek it.
In that sense, for me, it’s different
than someone w ho’s out there on
a daily basis. They want to be
seen. You’re putting yourself out
there, you’re going to lose a great
deal of freedom. The problem
with me, as a celebrity, is I used
to be able to go to a bar or a park
and
ju st
watch
people.
Observation is one of the major
keys in acting. And you lose that
freedom. The thing that I miss the
most is that sense of obscurity
and the ability to blend in. Again,

A l e s t l e

if you’re going to take all the
goods, you’ve got be willing to
step up to bat. For me, it’s just
right.
Do you ever get star struck
anymore?
Meeting Ozzie Smith for me.
And I’ve met a lot of people. I
met Cary Grant, which for me,
was huge. But I was too
embarrassed to be introduced.
Were you surprised at all
about
the
longevity
of
“Married with Children?”
By the time I got to it, it was
so popular. I was surprised
because I had never seen it before
I got on it. I was like, “Wow.
What is this thing?” Then I got
how important it was in a weird
way. Now, internationally, that
show is huge. In countries you
can’t imagine: Israel, Australia,
Germany; gigantic! I get way
more mail from Europe than I do

T hursday, A p ril

from the United States.
Was there anything risque
on the show that you didn’t
want to do?
No. One time, in the main
titles, we had a girl on top of a
table. I was just supposed to be
looking at her legs. No
underwear. So, I’m just supposed
to look up at her with no
underwear. It was one of the
greatest days of my life. If it was
too risque, I wouldn’t do it, but
she did it.
I read that they’re reviving
the “Love Boat.” W hat do you
think about that?
I would be much more
interested in the old one honestly.
Unless they take a weird angle or
something, which would be fun.
But that would have to be HBO
that would do the true story of the
“Love Boat.” I think the old one,

if you did it once a month, put it
back to back with the original
“Fantasy
Island,”
maybe
“C harlie’s A ngels” , I think
people would watch.
In your profession, there
has to be some fear of aging.
W hat’s your take on that?
I, personally, have no fear of
it. But I’m finding this year, all
the new shows, they’re doing all
20-something. It’s being thrown
in my face, something I’ve never
thought about. I don’t care. But
you’re right. For women, it’s a
major problem . And it will
become more of a problem for
me. Because they write younger
and younger, because that’s the
audience they need.
What do you think of nerds
these days?
Nerds? They rule.

Some of us wanted a vacation, others had to go of on a journey to find
their future. What about the few that are going to be left behind?

Academ ically speaking
about race and sports
Last night a town hall meeting was held on ESPN
with President Clinton on race and sports. It was the
type of program people shouldn’t miss watching.
During the discussion, the issue of race-based
scholarships came up as one young white male college
bound student in the crowd commented on how
Danielle colleges focused on giving scholarships to less
Belton academically inclined minority athletes, and weren’t
giving out enough scholarships to academically inclined non­
minority students.
It was a confusing question, but it wasn’t a surprise. If I had just
glanced at the surface o f an issue, I would have come to the same
conclusion that he was leaning towards. He was accusing the
universities o f showing preference and not being fair. Therefore I
was very pleased by G eorgetown basketball coach, John
Thompson’s response that preferences are not given just to athletes.
Privileges are given to the rich and to the sons and daughters of
alumni contributors. There are many scholarships that just target
certain groups of people. During my senior year of high school I ran
across scholarships that ranged from scholarships for very tall girls,
to scholarships for left-handed people.
The young man who asked this question also asked if as if the
issue of race could be attached to it, when if an athlete is white and
very talented, he too will receive an athletic scholarship. Also, both
white and black students with good grades are often turned down for
scholarships. SIUE receives thousands of applicants every year. I’m
sure many o f them have good grades, but SIUE is not about to hand
out over a thousand scholarships either.
Athletes are the ones that often help bring in the big money for
colleges and universities. Often college basketball and football
teams’ revenues are the money that helps sustain the other sports and
activities on campus as well as various academic resources.
Therefore it makes sense that schools spend more time recruiting
and wooing a person that can average 25 points a game versus
someone with a 4.0 average. Unless it is a top university, such as an
Ivy League school like Harvard or Yale, which was built almost
entirely on academics, most universities are going to Work on
beefing up their sports programs in order to help keep financing the
university.
Although the average grades for most students are Cs and Bs,
there is a large number of A students in our country, and they’re all
trying to get into college. Unless a student is of near-genius standing
or is so exceptional that a university can’t help but recruit them for
academics, most good students will probably just have to pay for
their schooling themselves and have better luck applying for a
scholarship within the university as a student or within the
department in which they are pursuing their major. After all, it did
work for me. I came here upset because I w asn't offered any sort of
aid, but after a year I declared a major and found a scholarship in
mass communications. Therefore the key is to look for the
scholarship; most of us cannot wait for the recruiter to come to us.

L e tte r s to th e e d i t o r --------------------------------------Opinions from all around campus, featuring two very different responses
from Corey Stulce's “Rants and R aves” on President Bill Clinton.
President more than just
another man
I applaud Mr. G ross for
challenging the alternative value
system put forth by Mr. Stulce in
his April 7 column. I am still not
sure how seriously Stulce wants
himself taken, after stating “I
don’t mind having my words
taken very serious,...but I don’t
want people to take them so
seriously.” Clarify, please?
Stulce claims he is just “a
man with a computer who likes to
put a few words down.” I find
him entertaining fairly often.
Please watch your subject matter,
however. There may have been a
few on campus who thought it
humorous to think of President
Clinton as ju st another man,
“certainly not alone,” who “likes
sex, and not always with his
w ife.” I was not amused,
however, as your hum or was
based on allegations against
President Clinton that were not
confirmed coupled with sexist
slurs towards your own gender. I
would hope you never try racial
humor in the near future, as this
campus is at least intolerant of
insensitivity on that topic.
Also, how is the relationship
between Mr. Gross and this
campus rem otely com parable
between the relationship our
president has with the governed?
Mr. Gross was not elected by the
entire student body, hence, it
would be out of place for the

N

e w

s ,

Alestle to investigate him. He
was elected by an organization
with enough integrity to impeach
him on the basis of the mere
allegation of impropriety, if he
did not resign beforehand. This is
just a campus organization - why
is it that our nation cannot be run
as efficiently with good faith in
those who lead it? Are we
reverting back to a system of
monarchy wherein the king can
throw whatever lies, bribes or
inconsistencies he chooses into
the due process of law, clouding
investigations to the point that no
one
dare
claim
anything
conclusive, one way or the other?
This is not to claim that
President Clinton does all of the
“dirty work,” or even that he is
aware of the possibility of
obstruction of justice by any of
his staff. What is apparent is that
the independent counsel should
not be classified as the “nosy
middle-aged neighbor,” but
instead should be respected to
find the truth without obstacles in
a constitutional manner that rises
above the allegations o f the
sexually deviant paparazzi.
W endy M . Woody
Fresh., undeclared

Republican Hypocrisy
It truly amazes me that the
College Republicans have the
nerve to criticize Clinton for
moral
shortcom ings.
They

S p o r t s ,

L if e s t y le ,

conveniently forget about Newt
Ginrich divorcing his first wife
while she was sick in the hospital
with cancer. It was also recently
revealed that Dick Armey had
sexually harassed one o f his
secretaries a while back. Let’s not
forget
about
Illinois
Congressman Philip Crane, who
had a sexual relationship with a
seventeen year-old page when he
was around fifty years old. I
believe that’s called being a
pedophile. In my opinion,
Congressman Crane should be
rotting in jail. Yet you’ll never
hear about these public officials
from the Republicans.
Furthermore, I fail to see the
relevance of wasting time and
money
investigating
the
president’s
sex
life
and
W hitew ater
dealings
that
occurred over twenty years ago
involving a questionable loan of a
couple thousand dollars. W here’s
Ken Starr’s enthusiasm for
people like Michael Milken, who
stole millions of dollars?
Many presidents, Democrat
and Republican, have had affairs
and have done great jobs. We
were better off in the days when
people didn’t have to know about
these matters, and we didn’t have
a bunch of demented Peeping
Tom’s and Jane’s. It is not up to
the Republicans to pretend to be
God. Only serious charges with
merit, like forcible rape, should
be investigated.

A rgonne super x-ray used on 5,000-year-old m ale fig u rin e
LEMONT, 111. (AP) — How
do you diagnose a broken leg in a
5,000-year-old figurine? With the
super X-ray machine at Argonne
National Laboratory, o f course.
Scientists recently used the
billion-dollar,
2-year-old
machine, the Advanced Photon
Source, to scan the 11-inch-tall
metal figurine in the hope of
discovering m ore about the
object’s creation and its creators.
Until now, the only way to
find out more about how the
figurine had been made would
have been to cut it up and m elt it
down, som ething that nobody
was w illing to do.

The male figurine was
among six such objects dug up in
1936 by an archeological team
from the Oriental Institute at the
University o f Chicago. They
were found in the Amuq Valley
near Antioch (now Antakya), the
city of biblical fame in south
central Turkey.
The figurine is tantalizing to
scientists because it was made at
the same time that humans were
discovering a host of new metals.
“W hen tin started getting
mixed with copper, everything
else came along with it,” said
Aslihan Yener, a professor at the
Oriental Institute. “Gold, silver

and lead. They all appear about
the same date, and we don’t
know why, or if it’s all
connected.”
Copper was the first metal
humans used, and bronze, made
by mixing copper with any
number of other metals, was the
first alloy ever developed. The
earliest bronzes were made with
copper and arsenic.
The figurine is the first
known instance when ancient
metallurgists began to use tin
instead of arsenic, making bronze
stronger and more malleable than
before. The tin-bronze recipe
became useful in art, architecture

obviously knowledgeable about
metallurgy,
repaired
it so
perfectly that the break remains
hidden to the naked eye.
“This is pretty exciting.
They
w ere
very
good
m etallurgists,” Yenner said.
“This is a new discovery.”
The
lim ited
initial
experiments on the figurine and
on a 200-year-old Japanese
sword went so well that scientists
from A rgonne, the Oriental
Institute and elsewhere are going
to push for a permanent
archeological center at Argonne.
They hope to save highly prized
time with the X-ray technology.

and weaponry.
After laying the figurine in a
lead-lined room at Argonne,
scientists bom barded it with
electrons traveling at nearly the
speed of light, creating X-ray
beams a m illion times more
powerful than medical X-rays.
The data stream ing across a
computer screen gave Yener an
analysis of the chemical content
of the material in each portion of
the figurine.
The
scanning
revealed
something never known before
about the object: in ancient times,
its legs had been broken off.

Washington sent Texas $88.9 b illion social security programs
W ASHINGTON (A P) —
The dollars flow to Texas from
Washington in the form of Social

All told, W ashington sent
$88.9 billion to Texas last year in

according to figures issued this
month by the Census Bureau.
The federal payout, while
huge, is ju st a sm all piece o f the
$1.4 trillion pie W ashington’s

doled out in fiscal 1997.
Texas, the nation’s second
most populous state, was third in

$160 billion and New York’s
nearly $96 billion.
W hile third in overall
dollar totals, the Lone Star State
ranks far from the top when
federal spending is broken down
per capita.
Texas received an average
o f $4,544 per resident last
year, according to the Census
B ureau’s Federal Expenditures
by State report, com pared to
a national average o f $5,263.
The
top
recipient
among
states was Virginia, with $7,856
per resident.
Looked at another way,
Texas accounted for 7.2 percent
o f the nation’s population last
year but received only 6.2
percent of federal expenditures.

A host of intangibles explain

willingness to provide money of

Funding inequities also arise
from the complex calculations

High school d rill considered a success despite 14 hospitalized
ATHENS, Ga. (AP) —
Athens-Clarke County officials
are
calling
last
w eek’s
disaster drill at Cedar Shoals
High School a success, despite
the fact that 14 people were
hospitalized after too much
smoke was accidentally released

inside the gymnasium.
At a critique of last Tuesday
night’s disaster drill, which sent
Cedar Shoals students and
Athens-Clarke firefighters to St.
Mary’s Hospital, several county
public safety officials said
Monday that the overall drill was

an improvement from the one
in 1997.
“It went much better than
last
year,”
A thens-Clarke
Assistant Fire C hief Larry
Pittman said. “All the agencies
worked quickly
and
well
together.”
Seven students and seven

firefighters
were
sent
to
the hospital com plaining of
throat irritation, headaches or
burning sensations in the lungs.
Smoke released from canisters
were blamed.
“Everyone did a splendid
job, particularly the (emergency
medical services) workers,” said

Richard
Rosser,
county
Emergency Management Agency
coordinator. “W hen the drill
turned into a real emergency, it
went by the wayside and those
people, those students, got
treatment right there w ithout
skipping a beat.”

Cryptographers crack d ig ita l ce ll phone code
BERKELEY,
C alifornia
(AP) — It was a challenge a trio
of com puter students and
professionals could not resist:
proving “tam perproof” digital
cellular phones are actually
vulnerable.
»
After about six hours of work,
two graduate students at the
U niversity of C alifornia at
Berkeley and a com puter
cryptologist w ere able to
“clone” the phone, allow ing
them to make unauthorized calls
from another phone.
“G iven the state o f the
security of other cellular phone

system s, I w asn’t terribly,
terribly surprised,” said Ian
Goldberg, one of the students.
The three looked at the project
as a challenge.
USA Today reported the
breakthrough on Monday.
Still, the amount of time and
effort it took to clone the codes
makes the digital phone security
m uch
m ore
difficult
to
circumvent than analog cellular
phones, which in comparison are
easily breached.
The three cracked the codes
guarding a Global System for
M obile C om m unications, or

GSM, phone. The GSM digital
standard is the most widely used
in the world, with more than 79
million phones in use.
O vercom ing the security'
also revealed a hint that the code
may have been intentionally
weakened during its design to
allow government agencies the
ability
to
eavesdrop
on
telephone conversations, The
New York Times reported
Tuesday.
Marc Briceno of Smartcard
D evelopers A ssociation, who
worked with G oldberg and
student David Wagner, said the

weakened code w ould let
powerful computers available to
intelligence agencies decode a
voice conversation relatively
quickly.
“I can’t think of any other
reason for what they d id ,”
Briceno said.
For years, the com puter
industry has been rife with
rumors
about
governm ent
intrusion or intimidation. Little
evidence has ever emerged to
support such speculation, the
Times reported, but the origins
of the GSM system are hazy.

World War I veteran dies Monday a t age 106
HOLLAND, Mich. (AP) —
Albert Arens, a baker with the
U.S. Army’s 85th Division in
World War I, died at a nursing
home here at the age of 106.
Arens, who died Monday,
had been the oldest veteran
in Michigan and one of fewer
than 50 who served in World
War I, state Veterans of
Foreign Wars officials told The

Holland Sentinel.
“Obviously we have lost a
significant piece of Am erican
history in his passing,” said Bob
Beam, chaplain for VFW Post
2144 in Holland. “He was a very
special guy. He had a place in my
heart being a fellow veteran.”
After serving in the Army,
Arens spent most of his working
career as a custodian at People’s

State
Bank
in
dow ntow n
Holland. He was a member of
M aple
Avenue
Christian
Reformed Church, where he
helped form the Young Boys
Christian A ssociation,
later
the Calvinists Cadets program for
the CRC.
“He was an excellent leader
and a Bible scholar,” said a
lifelong friend, Don Zw ier of

Jenison, who attended one of
A rens’ classes as a boy. “If
anybody asked him why he lived
so long, he told them it’s because
he never married.”
Arens, one of 13 children, is
survived by two sisters.
Services were scheduled for
Tuesday in Holland.

5 0 -y e a r-o ld W om an k ille d in P h illy ro b b e ry
PHILADELPHIA (AP) —
Police have recovered a stolen
sport utility vehicle but are still
searching for two men who
bound, gagged and robbed two
women, killing one of them, in an
exclusive section of the city.
Lois De Vita, 50, died of
asphyxiation after the men bound
her and her housemate, Holly
James, 44, with duct tape and
made off with a car belonging to
one of the women, police said.
The women may have known one
or both of their attackers and there
was no sign of a forced entry.
“There is one man w e’re
looking for in particular,”
Inspector Jerrold Kane said
Tuesday. “We don’t think this was

random. There may have been a
relationship.”
James had no serious injuries
in the Monday afternoon attack,
but investigators found De Vita
dead in the hom e’s basement,
where the two had been held
captive. The women had been
taped around their arms, legs,
mouth and eyes. James was able
to free herself and alert neighbors,
who called police to the scene at
about 8 p.m.
The sport utility vehicle the
women shared was found in a
section of southwest Philadelphia
after being involved in an
accident, police said. The driver
fled the scene.
The crime has stunned

residents in the historic, colonial
area, which sits on cobblestone
streets one block from the Betsy
Ross house. The handful of
homes on Loxley Court date to
the 18th century and were
rehabilitated in 1969 by Jam es’
father, Earl R. James, a prominent
Philadelphia developer in the
1940’s.
Neighbors o f the women
refused to discuss the incident.
John Zaks, who operates a
gift shop adjacent to the homes,
said nothing appeared unusual
Monday afternoon. Zaks rents the
space for the shop from Ms.
James.
“I didn’t notice anything,”
Zaks said, noting that foot traffic

on the block was light because the
Ross house is closed on Mondays.
“I was in and out of the store,
checking pedestrian traffic on the
street. I even looked through the
gates to see if any neighbors were
around, just to have someone to
kibitz with, but no one was
around,” he said.
“Zaks described the women
as affable and neighborly, saying
they would often shop at his store
or just pop in to say hello. De Vita
was casual and “outdoorsy,” he
said.
“We had a good rapport. I
hope they catch (the suspects)
really
fast.
T hey’re
the
perpetrators of a horrendous
crime.”

U.N. e x p e rt: Ira q i a b u s e lik e ly to c o n tin u e
GENEVA (AP) — Saddam
Hussein’s atrocities against Iraqi
citizens
probably
w ould
continue even if the U nited
Nations drops sanctions against
Iraq, a key U.N. human rights
expert said Tuesday.
Form er
Dutch
Foreign
M inister Max van der Stoel,
whose report on Iraq said
its regim e probably carried
out more than 1,500 politically
m otivated killings last year,
also rejected Iraqi criticism of
his report.

H

“I don’t think that if these
sanctions would end tomorrow
the regim e would change its
ways because still it would only
feel secure by maintaining its
present policy of oppression,”
he said at a news conference.
The 22-page report issued
last week to the annual session
of the U.N. Human Rights
C om m ission said the hum an
rights
situation
in
Iraq
deteriorated
last
year.
It
reiterated criticism of Iraq for its
treatment of ethnic minorities.

In Baghdad, the state-run
Al-Qadissiya newspaper called
Van der Stoel a U.S. puppet.
His report told a “silly lie
w hich cannot help A m erican
policy
against
Ira q ,”
the
newspaper added.
Responding to the report at
the com m ission, M oham m ed
Salman, an official at the Iraqi
mission in Geneva, accused Van
der Stoel o f basing
his
conclusions on reports from
sources
which
“are
not
trustw orthy
and
aim
at

overthrow ing
the
national
legitimate regime in Iraq.”
Iraq routinely refuses to let the
expert visit the country. Van der
Stoel lamented the governm ent’s
“absolute refusal to cooperate.”
Salman denied Iraq executed
prisoners for political motives, a
claim he said was made “in
order to provoke, m isguide and
m obilize the public opinion
against Iraq” as part of a U.S.
campaign to overthrow Iraq’s
regime by force.

A uthorities investigate herbal stim ulant’s role in teen’s death
VENTURA, Calif. (AP) —
A uthorities were investigating
w hether an herbal stim ulant
designed
to boost energy
contributed to the death o f a
healthy
15-year-old
soccer
player.
Last week, Rosanna Porras’
heart stopped and she collapsed
during soccer practice. Her
fam ily says she was taking
performance enhancing capsules
called Ripped Fuel, which
contains ephedrine.
Her cause o f death was
under investigation, but an
emergency room doctor told the
Ventura County Star that Federal
Drug Adm inistration officials
have requested Porras’ medical

records.
In April 1996, George
Korizis, a 23-year-old graduate
student, was found dead in his
Boston
apartment.
Coroner
officials linked the protein drink
Ripped Fuel to a toxic level of
ephedrine in his damaged heart
muscle.
Ephedrine stim ulates the
heart and nervous system, and is
derived from the plant ephedra,
or ma huang.
Company
officials
for
Twinlab Corp., the New Yorkbased maker of Ripped Fuel, did
not return phone calls seeking
comment,
the
new spaper
reported today.
For the past three years, the

FDA
has
been
crafting
restrictions for dietary and energy
supplements that contain ephedra
because of reported health
problems. In June, the FDA
unveiled a proposed requirement
that product labels recommend
taking no more than 24
milligrams of ephedra per day, or
8 milligrams in a six-hour period.
Additionally, the labels would
instruct consumers not to use the
product for more than seven
days.
The current Ripped Fuel
label says not to take more than
six capsules a day. Each pill
contains 167 m illigram s of
ephedra.
The label would also warn

that taking more than the
recommended dose could result
in heart attack, stroke, seizure or
death.
People
taking
energy
enhancem ent supplem ents are
likely
to
increase
the
recommended dosage with the
belief that taking more means
more
energy,
said
FDA
spokesman Arthur Whitmore.
“People should not assume
because something is natural, that
it is equivalent to safe,” he said.
FDA officials say they have
documented more than 900 cases
of adverse effects from ephedra
products. Injuries have ranged
from episodes o f high blood

pressure to heart attacks, strokes
and death, according to the FDA.
Whitmore could not confirm
that the FDA was investigating
Porras’ death. However, a doctor
who was not named, told the
newspaper that FDA officials
requested her medical records.
Fillmore Senior High School
Assistant Principal John Wilbur
said he was unaware of any
students taking Ripped Fuel.
“I don’t know whether the
coaches were aware or not. I
would expect that if they did
know, they would have dealt with
it,” Wilbur said.
Funeral services for Porras
were scheduled for Wednesday.

Key defense w itness stops sh o rt o f ca llin g gunman insane
PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) — A
forensic psychologist hired by
defense lawyers said Gerald
Atkins is disturbed, but could not
say the ex-paratrooper was
criminally insane when he shot
his way into an auto plant.
Dr. J. Reid Meloy of San
Diego testified Monday during
A tkins’ trial on first-degree

murder and 24 other felony
charges stemming from the Nov.
14, 1996 shootings at the Ford
Motor Co. assembly plant in
Wixom.
Plant manager Darrell Izzard
of Brighton was killed and three
others, including two Oakland
County sheriff’s deputies, were
wounded during the rampage.

Six experts called by Atkins’
attorneys testified last week that
the 31-year-old W ixom man
exhibited signs of several mental
disorders, but none called him
criminally insane.
On Monday, M eloy told
jurors that Atkins’ rampage was
the result of his obsession with a
plant worker he hardly knew, her
rejection of his advances and his

belief that Ford M otor Co. was
hindering the relationship.
But
under
crossexamination, Meloy admitted he
never met Atkins and that his
findings were based only on a
review of reports by others.
“Are
you
telling
this
jury that the defendant should
not
be
held
crim inally
responsible for his actions on

Nov. 14?” A ssistant Oakland
County
Prosecutor
Cheryl
Matthews asked.
“No, I am n ot,” Meloy
responded. " I t w ould not be
appropriate for me to diagnose
Mr. Atkins.”
Testimony was to conclude
Tuesday before C ircuit Judge
David Breck.

Even though W ickersham
said the bill does not increase
state spending, Lincoln Sen.
Don Wesely said the Nebraska
Business Summit will use it to
its advantage in an effort to
gather signatures on a petition
for a constitutional am endm ent
limiting state spending.
“T h ey ’re looking for an
excuse to whip up the public,”
Wesely said. "Y o u will hand
them the weapon that will be
used against us in the months to
com e.”
K ristensen
said th e re ’s
nothing the Legislature can or

u

rn

m

will do to stop the petition from
being circulated.
“T hey’ve
m ade
their
choice,” he said. “T hey’re going
to run a petition.”
The Legislature should not
make decisions based on what a
group of business leaders might
do, Bohlke argued. And, she
said, not passing the bill would
create confusion among schools.

Mr. Freeze makes awaited debut at Six Flags
■ BY LEAH HOLBROOK
FOR THE ALESTLE
There is a chill in the air at Six Flags over St.
Louis with the opening of “Mr. Freeze.”
“Mr. Freeze” is Six Flags’ newest ride. It was
originally scheduled to open last season, but
was delayed. The “Mr. Freeze” ride, located in
the Snowy Cone” factory, finally opened April 10
for the 1998 Six Flags season. Lee Stellhom,
“Mr. Freeze” rollercoaster engineer, said the
opening o f the ride was delayed due to
performance-related issues.
“It just w asn ’t perform ing efficiently and
sufficiently enough,” Stellhom said. “So, we just
wanted to make sure that we had those issues taken
care of before we opened it to the public.”
Stellhom said the delay was not due to safety
issues. He said he hopes for a big turnout for the
“Mr. Freeze” roller coaster. “Mr. Freeze” is an
impressive addition to the Six Flags amusement
park. Stellhorn designed “Mr. Freeze” with an
innovative design that “utiles linear induction motor
technology and electromagnetic power.”
Passengers o f the “Mr. Freeze” ride are thrust
into a bone-chilling experience with the

acceleration of 70 miles per hour in under four
seconds. Passengers are then catapulted to a height
o f 226 feet after taking a 90 degree vertical dive and
130 degree “wing over.” The ride is capped with a
freezing halt, when the track ends in mid-air, before
blasting the passengers backwards through the
entire rollercoaster. This is the first roller coaster to
use linear induction motors in a reverse fashion. The
usual method of propelling passengers backwards
through a roller coaster relies on gravitational force.
The “Mr. Freeze” roller coaster contains two
passenger trains seating 20 each. This allows for
one train to be loading at the same time the other
train is barreling down the track. Therefore,
allowing 1,200 passengers to ride per hour. The icy
blue “Mr. Freeze” is 1,382 feet of track that lasts
approximately 47 seconds. Although it is quick,
passengers will be satisfied with what Six Flags is
calling the “coolest” ride on earth.
First time riders either walked away in shocked
silence or raced to ride again.
“It was like a race car when you first take off,”
passenger Krista Bauer said. “It throws you back in
your seat, but the best part is when you shoot
straight up.”

Springfest ’98 begins on
Tuesday in the quad
■ BY JASON
TRIPPLETT
LIFESTYLE REPORTER
Springfest ‘98 is here. Next
week Coca-Cola, the Kimmel
Leadership Center, and the
Springfest Planning Committee
are sponsoring SIUE's annual
spring festival which is themed
“fun in the sun.”
This year's festival includes
music, gam es, contests, food,
student booths, and other types of
entertainm ent. Students can
enjoy the break of the college
monotony by going outdoors to
participate in the many activities.
“It's a great way to spend your
time between classes,” said Brett
Licata, a mass communications
major from St. Charles Mo. “It

gives me a chance to relax and
enjoy the nice weather with my
friends.”
Over 40 booths, including: a
dunking booth, bungee run,
obstacle course, two basketball
Pop-A -Shots, and a soccer
penalty kick will be among the
various attractions in the quad
next week.
From 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
each day, events are scheduled
such as a visit from a Black Hawk
helicopter, a limbo contest, and
wacky relays two out of the three
days of the celebration.
Various musical artists will
play, including ska-band The
Secretaries.
Schedules for the events are
posted on campus. See you in the
quad next week.

Say What?!?
What television show should

“‘Dukes of Hazard.’ It’s
got it all: politics,
oppression of the people,
sex scandals, dumb cops,
family sticking together
and Boss Hogg.”
Matt Vogel
Fr., mass comm.

There are two people in this
world I would never want to turn
my back on. The first is “Rowdy”
Roddy Piper, and the second is
Christopher Walken.
And I certainly would not
want to kidnap Walken, tie him to
a chair and cut his finger off as
the lads in “Suicide Kings” do.
Because, at some point, Walken
is going to get loose.
The plot for the “Kings” has
some interesting twists, and the

strong cast certainly helps. The
ensemble is made up of Walken
and a group of five 20somethings as the kidnappers.
After one of the boys’ sisters is
kidnapped, they devise a plan to
kidnap Walken, a local mobster,
in order to get her back. They
want to use his power to find out
who has kidnapped her.
But Walken never loses
control of the situation, even as
he is slowly bleeding to death.
The movie has great cat and
mouse suspense sequences.
And to add humor to the dark
tale, Denis Leary enters as

The Suicide Kings, from
left: Sean Patrick Flanery,
Christopher Walken, Johnny
Galecki, Jay Mohr, Jeremy
Sisto, and Henry Thomas.
Walken’s right hand man. His
rants are quite comical.
The plot does go a bit awry at
the end, as the tables are turned
on everyone involved. But at that
point, even a less-than-brilliant
ending is forgivable.
The quick pace and funny
dialogue are enough to keep the
quirky kidnap caper afloat.

see the whole cast to
see if they have
changed any.”

Josh Brolin said that he and
Patricia A rquette have been
friends for 10 years, but in
“N ightw atch,” their new film
together, he may just be trying to
kill her.
Of course in their last film
together,
“Flirting
with
Disaster,” he licked her armpits
on camera. Fans of Arquette
might be curious as to what her
pits taste like.
“Baby oil, I don’t know. Dirt,
all right,” Brolin said.
The second-generation actor
(His dad is Jam es Brolin of
“Hotel”
and
“A m ityville
Horror”) is starting to get noticed
in Hollywood. His turn as a
bisexual police
officer in
“Flirting...” scored him praise,
and now he has a high-profile
role as the creepy James in the
thriller “Nightwatch.”
The much-delayed film from
Dimension involves a young
morgue security guard (Ewan
McGregor), who gets involved a
string of murders. Brolin is

M cG reggor’s best friend, and
possibly w orst enemy. His
character James is manipulative
and cruel, and at tim es very
mysterious.
“James is a type o f character
who wants to be noticed. He has
no idea who he is. H e’s just one
walking void. I’m sure he would
totally embrace the idea that he is
a killer,” Brolin said.
Brolin has been acting
on the screen for about fifteen
years, and got his start in the
Steven
Spielberg-produced
“The Goonies.”
“I just saw him [Spielberg] a
couple of weeks ago. The guy has
the heart of a child, which is nice
to be around when you’re a kid,
which I was,” Brolin said. “I
don’t think I was in the position
to be in awe yet. He would laugh
at me because I would be reading
all of these acting books and
■saying, ‘W alking through the
tunnel is like walking through
your m other’s womb.’ He would
just look at me and go, ‘W hatever
dude. Just shut up and act.’”
With acting being such a hard
biz to break into, Brolin’s father

was a little worried about his
son’s career choice.
“Once I got into it, and once
he saw me on the stage in New

father went to see the daughter in
Macbeth and walked out in the
middle of it. I don’t think my old
man would do that,” Brolin said.
Brolin was intrigued by the

film takes place in a morgue. “I
think it’s an interesting subject.
We’re one of the only societies

he said.
Although he’s in the limelight
now, Brolin may have to take a
back seat to his father in the press
soon. The elder Brolin is engaged
to m edia m ainstay Barbara
Striesand. And how would Josh
Brolin describe the perfect

“She sings. The perfect

listens, and she definitely
listens,” Brolin said.

Cougar baseball ranked 12th in Nation; beat Bearcats 17-9
■ BY TONY AMMANN
SPORTS REPORTER
If Mark M cG w ire, Ray
Lankford and Brian Jordan all
retired today, the St. Louis
Cardinals might not have to look
too
far
for
adequate
replacements.
Right across the Mississippi
River resides a college, none
other than SIUE, which currently
ranks 12th in the nation among

NCAA Division II schools.
Though
A rkansas
and
Louisville are the real farm
systems . for the Redbirds, a
number of SIUE Cougars have
offensive numbers that would
make Hank Aaron jealous.
The Cougars, 9-3 in the Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference,
blasted McKendree College
Tuesday 17-9. SIUE banged out
22 base hits, 12 of those going
for extra bases.

Each of the nine starters in the
batting order had at least one hit
and scored at least once in the
balanced Cougar attack. A sixrun second inning and two other
four-run innings were too much
for McKendree to handle.

Mike
Robertson drove in four runs,

Softball No. 1 seed in GLVC; to face University

The No. 1 seed is supposed to
have the easiest draw, but the SIUE
softball team finds themselves facing
the University of Indianapolis, a team
that has defeated them twice earlier
this season, in the first round of the
Great Lakes Valley Conference
tournament
The Cougars were awarded the
top seed in the conference tournament
after going 18-3 in their last 21 games.
Two of those losses came at the hands
of the No. 8 seed, Indianapolis.
Head coach Sandy Montgomery
isn’t concerned about going down in
the first round since her team has been
on a hot streak as of late.

Mark McGwire had 1233 feet
of airtime Tuesday night at the
15-5 win over the young Arizona
Diamondbacks. That’s enough to
make even Air Jordan jealous.
Not only will I say I told you
so, but I also have to give it to the
Diamondbacks for making the
Cards look so nice.
Going through 6 pitchers in
one game is a sign of serious
uncertainty about your own club.
The Diam ondbacks manager,
Buck Showalter, didn’t have
much of a clue about his pitching
staff. The kick is that two of his
pitchers played for less than an
inning.
I can’t give all the credit to
McGwire; John Mabry and Brian
Jordan also hit homers into left
field. Jordan smacked one home
run off of Arizona’s Jeff Suppan
and Mabry smacked one off of
Barry Manuel.
I
do
feel
for
the
Diamondbacks. Facing such a
seasoned team is how their young

team will learn.
They sent six pitchers to the
mound, and the average age for
the six wonders is 27. Another
little
interesting
tidbit
of
information is that Jeff Suppan.
who incidentally pitched the first
six innings, has only been in the
majors about two years and is
only 23. That is only four years
older than me.
Consider that Mark is 35 and
has been in the majors since his
Rookie of the Year appearance in
1987. These boys were still in
braces running around the school
yard while Mark was spanking
the ball into the outfield.
I am not bashing a team for
taking chances on young players,
but next time they come into a
seasoned ball club with the
intention of f.;uyn.b „irious ball
they better watch some highlight
reels.
The 1996 National League
Champions are not hard to spot
and study. Maybe next time they
should try to look a little more
prepared to play big boys’ ball.

IRVING, Texas (AP) — The
Dallas Cowboys have reached an
agreem ent with free agent
running back Chris Warren, team
owner Jerry Jones said.
Jones declined to discuss
terms of the agreement, but told
the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on
Sunday night that the form er
Seattle Seahaw ks star has
reached an agreement with the
Cowboys.
The Dallas M orning News
quoted a team source as
saying W arren agreed to a

three-year contract worth $2
million, including a $600,000
signing bonus.
“H e’ll be a great addition,”
Jones told the Star-Telegram.
“We know that he’s going to get a
lot of work. That’s not to take
anything away from Em mitt
Smith, but (Warren) fits into our
plans.”
W arren, 30, was a fourthround draft choice who became
one of the NFL’s best backs
before Seattle released him last
month in an economic move.

In eight seasons, Warren
rushed for 6,706 yards, breaking
Curt W arner’s team record of
6,705 on last season’s final play.
He rushed for 1,000-plus yards
for four
straight
seasons,
including a team record and
A FC-leading 1,545 yards in
1994. He rushed for 847 yards
and four touchdowns last year.
Warren played in the Pro Bowl
in 1993, 1994 and 1995.
He became expendable when
the Seahawks signed Ricky
Watters last month.

Fight ends over estate of late Redskins owner
SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) —
The
widow
of
wealthy
Washington Redskins owner Jack
Kent Cooke has reached a secret
settlement with his heirs that
ends a year o f sniping over
mansions, maids and luxury cars.
Lawyers for C ooke’s estate,
estimated at $825 m illion when
he died in April 1997, would not
reveal any details of the deal with
Marlena Ramallo Cooke.
The Washington Post quoted
anonymous sources familiar with
the agreement who said Mrs.
Cooke, 45, will get $20 million.
The agreem ent announced
Monday resolves lawsuits filed
by both sides and averts a trial
scheduled for April 20.
“In most commercial cases, if
cases are going to settle, they
usually settle sometime close to
the trial date,” said Dan Webb,
lead attorney for the Cooke
estate. “That’s pretty traditional,
and that’s what happened here.”
Webb said “som e pretty
intense negotiations” began
about a week ago. The settlement
reached over the weekend will be
formalized and presented to court
later this week,” he said.
Mrs. Cooke’s lawyer, Brendan
Sullivan, did not return a call.
Cooke cut his wife out of his
will 13 weeks before he died at
84. He gave no explanation, but
lawyers for his estate later
claimed she broke a prenuptial

agreement by failing to live with
her husband “as man and wife.”
That allegation — never fully
explained — was but an opening
salvo in what became nearly a
year of caustic and often absurd
claims and counterclaims.
The estate alleged that after
Cooke died, his widow made off
with more than 400 items,
including silver, art and her
husband’s wallet, from one of the
couple’s two mansions.
Mrs. Cooke claimed the estate
cut off her credit card, snatched
her Jaguar and evicted her from
Cooke’s $3 million Washington
house out of spite. She proposed
a compromise: she would stay in
the house with one maid instead
of three while the will was
settled. The estate lawyers
refused and a judge agreed.
Mrs. Cooke, who was twice
married to the irascible sports
entrepreneur, sued to overturn
the will and claim a third of
his estate.
She also argued that the
couple’s prenuptial agreement
was bogus. She said she was
forced to sign the agreement the
day before her wedding in July
1995 and that Cooke hid the true
value of his estate from her.
The trial to divide Cooke’s
money was expected to last a
month or more and feature
testim ony about how Cooke
allegedly
tape-recorded
his

w ife’s calls and tracked her
m ovem ents
through
W ashington’s nightlife.
The judge in the case, William
Shore Robertson, repeatedly
prodded both sides to settle.
Lawyers fees could quickly
chew through m uch of Cooke’s
money, most o f which he set
aside for a charitable foundation,
the judge said.
The dueling lawsuits also left
the eventual ownership of the
Redskins up in the air.
C ooke’s son and principal
heir, R edskins president John
Kent Cooke Jr., has made it clear
he wants to hang onto the
Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium.
“I cannot discuss the terms of
the settlement, since they remain
confidential,” John Kent Cooke
said Monday. “However, I can
say it is a positive step in my goal
to purchase the Redskins.”
Coolce left his son millions,
but not enough to buy the team
outright.
Jack
K ent
Cooke
wed
Marlena Ramallo Chalmers for
the first time in May 1990, but
the marriage was annulled three
years later amid questions about
whether Mrs. Cooke was still
married to another man.
Mrs. Cooke is fighting
deportation to her native Bolivia
because o f an old cocaine
conviction.

Former Miami coach Schnellenberger setting up new football program
BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) —
Fifteen years after he coached
Miami to its first national
championship,
H oward
Schnellenberger is back in
Florida — this tim e to help
Florida Atlantic University field
its first football team.
Schnellenberger,
64,
on
Tuesday was named special
assistant to the director of
athletics for football operations a fancy title for the task of
building a Division I program
from scratch.
“We have to remember at one
time in 1911 Notre Dame had to

make this same kind of
commitment.
University
of
Miami had to do it in 1977,”
Schnellenberger said. “Every
school that’s new on the scene
has had to go through the birth
and the growth. In time, this can
be a terrific place.”
Before he thinks about an
inaugural
game
in
2001,
Schnellenberger’s first goal is to
help raise at least the $5 million
needed to get the program going.
School officials believe he has
the credentials to do it.
In 1983, Schnellenberger led
Miami to its first of four national

championships
while
also
establishing a marketing machine
that quadrupled the sale of season
tickets and increased television
revenues nearly 25-fold.
Two years later, he became
head coach o f a fledgling
Louisville program and took
it from the bottom of the national
rankings to a 10-1-1 record
by 1990.
He’s long said it might have
been easier to build a team from
nothing
than
to
revamp
Louisville’s system. Now he’ll
see if that’s truly the case.
“I’m going to be put to the

test,” he joked Tuesday.
The $5 million start-up costs
do not include the price of a
stadium, which the Owls don’t
yet have. They plan to start out in
Lockhart Stadium in nearby Fort
Lauderdale which seats about
25,000, said FAU President
Anthony Catanese.
Schnellenberger, who lives
about an hour south of here in
Miami Lakes, had been in search
of a new challenge since being
driven out of Oklahoma in 1995
after one year at the helm. He has
a 100-77-3 record as a head
college coach during 16 seasons

at M iami, Louisville
and
Oklahoma.
Schnellenberger also served as
an assistant to form er Miami
Dolphins coach Don Shula,
including the 1972 perfect
season, and as head coach of
the Baltimore Colts in 1973
and 1974.
He refused to commit Tuesday
as to whether he would coach the
Owls, saying only that he’d hire
the best man available when the
time comes.
Could that person be him?
“It’s conceivable,” he said
with a smile.

Griffey hits 300th career homer Martin exercises option to stay with NY Jets
CLEVELAND (AP) — Ken
Griffey Jr. hit his 300th career
home run
M onday
night,
becoming the second youngest
player to reach the milestone.
G riffey’s 300th, a tw o-run
shot to right off Jose M esa in
the seventh, was his second
homer of the game and sixth this
season. Griffey, who hit 56
homers last season, paused to
watch the historic shot estim ated
at 391 feet.
“Growing up w atching my
dad, he never was a pow er
hitter,” Griffey said. " H e was a
contact, line drive, getting guys
over kind of hitter. T hat’s the
ballplayer that I wanted to be. I
wanted to be just like my dad.
“I’ve got a 4-year-old son
who wants to be ju st like me. I
never thought I’d reach th is.”
Griffey, who has hit at least
40 homers four tim es, is 28
years, 143 days old. Jim m ie
Foxx was 27 years, 328 days old
when he hit his 300th. Foxx hit

534 homers during his Hall of
Fame career.
Griffey Jr. and his father have
452 homers combined. They are
second to Bobby and Barry
Bonds, who have 709.
Griffey didn’t want to hear
much about history because he
his third hom er in two days
was
wasted
in
another
M ariners’ loss. Seattle dropped
to 3-9, the second-worst start in
franchise history.
“None of those people you
ju st nam ed can help m e,”
Griffey said. “I can just try to
help the other 24 guys in
this room .”
It was Griffey’s 31st career
multi-homer game and 28th with
two homers. His 300th came on
a 1-1 pitch from Mesa after Alex
Rodriguez doubled.
G riffey was the fourthyoungest player to reach the
250-homer mark when he did it
last season, trailing only Foxx,
Eddie Mathews and Mel Ott.

The Patriots protested a
clause in the contract that
prohibited a team from making
Martin a franchise or transition
player, as well as the one-year
option.
But
the
NFL
Management Council ruled the
contract was valid.
New England received New
York’s first- and third-round
picks in this weekend’s draft.
The Patriots already had the
Jets’ second-rounder as part of
the compensation package for
signing Parcells after the
1996 season.
After signing Martin, the Jets

each of his three NFL seasons.
