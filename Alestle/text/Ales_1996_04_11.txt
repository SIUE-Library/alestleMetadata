• The Madison County Humane Society will celebrate its 10th year this spring.
To celebrate, the group will hold an open house at 2 p.m. Saturday at the
Edwardsville shelter, 8495 Illinois 143. Tours will be given, and dogs and cats will
be available for adoption.

National---------------------------------------------------------4 states to keep track of a rare brain illness
• Four states will begin tracking a mysterious brain illness in Americans—
strictly as a precaution—after Britain’s mad cow disease scare. The states are
Minnesota, California, Connecticut and Oregon. Doctors at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday they had seen no signs that
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was occurring more frequently among Americans. But
tabulating the incidence of the rare illness will ensure that U.S. doctors will spot
any disturbing trends.

International_______________________________
Japanese broadcaster resigning over scandal
• The president of a major Japanese TV station is resigning over his company’s
dealings with the doomsday cult accused in the nerve gas attack on Tokyo’s
subways. Hirozo Isozaki told a nationally televised news conference Tuesday that
he accepts responsibility for the widely criticized actions of the Tokyo
Broadcasting System, the subject of a government investigation. The TV station
showed Aum Shinri Kyo members an unaired tape of a lawyer harshly criticizing
their cult. Soon after the secret screening in 1989, lawyer Tsutsumi Sakamoto, his
wife and infant son disappeared. Their bodies were not discovered until last year
when the cult came under close scrutiny following the subway attack.

Parents deserve an education too
This time of year is a very hectic time for all
college students, myself included. Not only am
I learning to take over as editor in chief for
next year, (Yes everyone, I actually got the
job!) but I am also trying to accomplish all of
those end of the semester projects I have been
procrastinating on for the past 12 weeks.
While I was working on one of my
assignments Tuesday in the computers lab, the
sweet sound of a baby crying out in the hall
way filtered in through the open doorway.
Editorial
I smiled to myself as I do everytime I hear a
baby cry, thinking fondly of my 16 month old
By Melanie Adams
sister Emily, at home. Emily is a little ray of
sunshine to me. She was born when I was
away at school last year and the eighteen
years between us makes me feel like more of a mother figure than a sister to
her.
I have watched her learn how to talk, sit up and walk. I have helped raise
her and needless to say I am more than a little eager to have children of my
own.
I guess that is why when I heard the conversation between the two people
sitting next to me that I became so enraged. You see, they also heard the
baby cry, but they did not smile as I did. Instead, they complained about it.
“Why doesn’t she take it outside. Man, I hate that when people bring their
kids to school,” one of the students said.
“Yeah, me too, if they have kids they should leave them with a baby sitter
or not go to school till the kid is grown enough to go to school themselves,”
the other said.

I couldn’t believe what I had heard. I understand that not everyone feels
the way I do about children, but I was certain that at least everyone going to
college would be at least a little understanding toward someone who is trying
to get an education.
We all are struggling to get an education, single, married, with children,
and without, returning student, or just beginning to see the world. We are all
united by a place called academia and we must be more understanding of one
another.
/
When I see a mother wheeling a stroller down the hall to a classroom, or a
dad lifting a child up so they can get on the bus at Tower Lake I am not
disgusted by the sight. In fact, I am inspired. I am inspired because they are
not letting even the largest of obstacles, albeit an enjoyable obstacfe, stand in
the way of their education.
I know from experience that college is challenging enough as a single
young kid that has a hard enough time taking care of herself. I know for a
fact that if I were put in their situation, I couldn’t manage a college career
and take care of a family at the same time.
Maybe I am overly sensitive about parents in college. My parents were
those people, my mother still is. I admire my parents for their struggle to
make it through their academic goals and I encourage anyone who wants a
college education to get one.
To the mothers and fathers on campus, keep up the good work. Don’t let
anyone discourage you from getting the education you deserve. And to the
two in the computer lab, I would just like to say, I hope that you gain a little
more compassion and a lot more open mindedness.
If it were you with the child would you quit school and wait till your child
was old enough to start school to get your college education? Just something
to think about.

letter to the editor___________________________________________________________________________________________________

Guaranteed annual income places an
emphasis on what made the US great
I greatly appreciate M att Gross’ response to my
editorial on the need for a guaranteed annual
income for every American. However, I strongly
disagree with his prognosis of my proposal. I will
respond to his points seriatim.
Gross claims that the poor of our country really
are not so bad off...after all, most of them own
microwave ovens. He also claims that sixty percent
of the poor own air conditioners. “So why is
everybody complaining?” he asks. Let me remind
Gross that by his own calculations, nearly twentytwo million people have no air conditioning. The
effects of this can be devastating, for one whole
week in the summer of 1995 the temperature in
Chicago reached over ninety degrees. Because of
this single act of nature, over five hundred poor,
mostly elderly, mostly African-American roasted to
death because they had no air conditioning. No
American deserves such a miserable (and
preventable) death. As terrible as the right-winginspired Oklahoma City bombing was, the Chicago
heat wave killed twice as many people.
Gross also dismisses the fears of the middle-class.
Despite the thousands of studies, surveys and
personal interviews conducted on the subject that
find good reason for them to be worried, he blames
middle class insecurity on “people who preach fear”
such as myself. Yes, it is true, Americans are awash
in a bevy of consumer goods unmatched possibly
anywhere else in the world. It is also true that while
Americans have televisions, they do not have health
insurance; they get cable, but can’t put their children
through college. Increasingly, manager and laborer
alike lose their job due to no fault of their own. As
USA TODAY has noted, most displaced workers do
not find jobs that pay as well as their old jobs.
The point of my letter was to p c;nt out that the

economy has and is going through an enormous
change. Change is always traumatic. The industrial
age is over, the information age has arrived. Gross
claims unemployment will not rise due to
automation. Here, he is simply wrong. It already has.
To what extent it will continue on into the future is
anybody’s guess, and anyone who tells you they
know is fibbing. Computerized automation is unique
in economic history precisely because it does not
require humans to run it. Machines built in the
industrial age were made for mass production and
thus, lean employment. US employment figures
seem to paint a rosy picture right now because, in
part, of the crazy way we measure unemployment.
“Discouraged” workers who are “no longer looking
for employment” (which really means they can’t find
a job) are no longer counted as unemployed. On the
other hand, workers who work only a few hours per
week are counted as fully employed. Another factor
which suggests unemployment is becoming more
acceptable is the fact that the unemployment rate
used to determine full employment has been steadily
increasing over the course of the last few decades
from two percent to nearly six percent.
It seems obvious that Gross sees people as
commodities. He states that some people do not give
“good service to others, and therefore should not be
compensated with money.” I believe that every
American deserves a minimal level of personal and
economic security as a benefit of being a citizen of
this great nation. People should not be seen as
commodities, indeed, that is the point of a
guaranteed annual income.
Gross wants to know how I would pay for such a
program. Yes, it would take a tax increase to pay for
this program. However, not as large as many
conservative might have you believe. This program

would replace Social Security and most welfare, thus
using what is already allocated for those programs. If
done correctly, we could raise taxes on the wealthiest
one percent and give the middle class and the poor a
tax break. But, let me be clear, the conservative
argument that “big government” is bad, is simply a
myth. It isn’t the size of the government that is the
problem, rather, it is what it does and does not do. To
conservatives, any government spending is bad and
inefficient. If this were true, then the countries
whose government revenue is the largest percentage
of their GNP would be the most inefficient. Sweden,
Norway and Denmark all have tax revenues that are
nearly twice as great as the US in terms of their
GNP’s, yet all have a higher GNP per capita than the
US and have outperformed our economy for the last
few decades. The US economy is no longer number
one not because our taxes are too high (in fact, they
are the lowest in the advanced industrialized world),
but because we do not adequately invest in our
people. All our competitors have some form of
public pension, all have universal health insurance.
Finally, Gross is inventing when he warns some
“Washington police” that would result from my
proposal. A guaranteed annual income would
actually eliminate layers and layers of bureaucracy
now devoted to means testing and the like, and
would give people the freedom to do whatever they
want to with the money they receive. Gross believes
we should “put the emphasis on what has made this
country great—The Am erican people.” That is
precisely what a guaranteed annual income would
do.

undergraduate, this would mean increases of $91.20, $94.80, $99.60 and $104.40 per academic
year; for full-time graduate students, increases of $97.20, $102, $106.80 and $111.60 per
academic year.
In addition, the School of Dental Medicine plans to increase the tuition rate between $300
and $409 per semester over the next four years.
SIUE will also propose fee increases for housing and student activity fees.
Residents at Tower Lake Apartments will have a 6 percent increase and the Residence Hall
will have a 4 percent increase if the proposal is approved.

“The university housing increases is slightly high than projected last year because of
; adjustments in cable service charges and Internet connections,” Smith said.
Student activity fees will increase by about $100 over the next four years, with a 4.73 percent
increase next year.
According to the summary of the plan, the tuition will continue to be the lowest of all senior
public universities.
“Funds will be allocated to support the most critical needs as identified by the chancellors,
the president and the board of trustees in accordance with the university’s goals, priorities and
mission,” the summary of the plan stated. “This additional revenue is needed if the university
is to continue to fund its operational needs and to provide the quality of education our students
expect and deserve.”
The tuition increase plan will be voted on by the board of trustees in May.

SIUE starts new recycling program

H ear

A ud io by US Is yo ur sou rce for

A l e s i l e

The recycling program as we know it will becom e a thing of the past at Southern Illinois
U niversity at Edwardsville. A new program will be im plem ented this year by David
M cDonald, coordinator of Environm ental H ealth and Safety.
“We want to enhance and expand the num ber of m aterials that can be recycled,”
M cDonald said.
The program is being funded through a grant provided by the Illinois D epartm ent of
Commerce and Community Affairs.
“Money from the grant will be used to purchase 10 new recycling bins which will be
placed next to Alestle stands for people to place their new spapers,” M cDonald said.
“S IU E ’s goal is to recycle at least 40 percent of its solid waste by the year 2000.”
The program coordinators intend to reach their goal by targeting m aterials that
comprise a high percentage of waste that is also m arketable, such as alum inum , cardboard,
newspaper, office paper and scrap metal.
In order for the program to reach its goal, the university has to recycle at least 120 tons
of office paper, 100 tons of cardboard, 36 tons of alum inum , 44 tons of newspaper and 25
tons of scrap metal each year.
SIU E has been com m itted to environm ental responsibility. D uring 1994, the university
recycled 56 tons of paper, saving 952 trees and 185 cubic yards of landfill space. In 1995,
89 tons of paper was recycled, resulting in the saving of 1,513 trees and 267 cubic yards of
landfill space.
With the addition of a cardboard com pactor that will be placed at S IU E ’s Supporting
Service and m ore paper recycling bins, the savings is expected to increase even more.
The new program will begin April 22. There will also be a booth that day in the
U niversity C enter from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. which will give away T-shirts, mugs and
brochures prom oting the program .
Q uestions or suggestions regarding recycling can be forw arded to David M cDonald at
692-2438 or Steve Coffey at 692-3584.

H er story, titled “Old M an W atson’s R evenge” which is
about an old man who leaves his wife and takes up with a
floozy who takes him for all h e ’s w orth, was inspired by a
hairdresser she heard about.
“I heard about this problem and added some things
until it turned into a story,” said Peterson.
R u d d er’s years as a m inister, a businessm an, a singersongwriter, and a college financial aid officer exposed
him to a great deal of experience from which to draw
from for his story “The Prophesy.”
A lso a returning student, R udder sees him self as a
“N ineteenth century man who really doesn’t belong in
this century.”
Both stories will be published in this year’s edition of
the R iverbluff Review.
The winners were chosen from the co n test’s thirty-five
entries. Tied for second runner-up w ere G eorge Burbank

Black Greeks ready to rock the show in Greek Quake ‘96
Organizations
o f the PanHellenic
Council to
perform first
step show
Melissa Wathen/Alestle
Members from the various greek organizations are getting their steps together for the Greek Quake 96 that will be
held Sat., April 13 at 7 p.m. in the Vadalabene Center.

By Nia’ko McDaniel
For the Alestle

Stepping to the rh ythm s of the m otherland has alw ays been
ex citin g for the black, greek-lettered organizations on our cam pus of
SIUE. E xcitin g, u n til sudden privileges were revoked due to academic
and disciplinary probation. It’s been three years since a greek
m archdown has occurred. And due to cancellation of som e
organizations, sp irits have been lowered am ong the student body, but
especially am ong the greek s them selves.
The m archdown is a collaboration of well-choreographed steps that
display the unique characteristics of each organization. It takes a
lifetim e of w ork and sk ill to reach the point of flaw less precision,
tactfuln ess and confidence.
“Preparing for a step show takes a trem endous am ount of
com m itm ent in order to reach that certain goal of perfection.
“Stepping is not for everybody, it is an art,” Ida Tinsley-Roundtree
said. She is a member of the Delta Sigm a Theta sorority.
In the past th is event w as the b ig g est African-Am erican affair that
ever set foot onto the cam pus. It brought in over
thousands of stu d en ts from all over the states. No m atter
w here you were, w hether it b eing Howard U niversity or
Cornell, th is w as a g a th erin g that w ould not be m issed.
Calendars were m arked and that day w as h ig h ly
anticipated.
M illions of dollars were collected to help support the
charitable cause that w as chosen for that year by the
organizations. Each year, w hen tim e cam e around again
to d iscu ss the details of the show, all m em bers of the
N ational Pan-H ellenic Council (w hich con sists of every
black greek organization), w ould contribute input that
would later be considered the final resu lts of the
m archdow n—from the am ount of the cash prizes being
awarded to the them e o f the event.
There w as a different aura am ong the cam pus then
than there is now that obviously presented a great sense
of u n ity and sportsm anship between the greek world.
“I don’t th in k that the show th is year w ill exem plify the
great m agnitude as it did in 1992. T his is due to the
different reprim ands by the school adm inistration and
the lack of greek u n ity am ong the greek s here. Overall,
I don’t believe a step show is the way to show unity. It’s

since ‘92

n oth in g m ore than a com petition,” Dante N ash, a junior, said.
Because of the lack o f know ledge o f the event by our new
generations o f students, the spirit and enth u siasm has to be
rekindled.
“It’s g o in g to take a w hile for the show to get back on its feet as it
was in the prior years, but I'm sure that it w ill be a success anyway,”
Television and Radio major LaQuetta Dobbs said.
N ot only the African-Am erican stu dents, but stu dents o f all races
are lookin g forward to h avin g su ch a great event on their cam pus
again. W hen asked how does it feel to have the m archdown back,
LaVonne Levy said, “It’s g o in g to be the bomb! It show s that black
greek s can com e together and handle their b u sin ess.”
H aving another chance at sh o w in g peers w hat it used to be like in
the old days is g o in g to be som eth in g that the greek s w ill never
forget. Now, at the m ark of the fourth year of not having a show,
stepp ing to the rh ythm s o f the m otherland will be a tradition that
w ill continue to be a vivid m em ory in their m inds forever.
“G reekquake” takes place Saturday, April 13, at 7 p.m in the
Vadalabene Center. Don’t m iss out on an event of a lifetim e.

Who's the Man?
By Darryl Howlett

T h e

A l e s i l e

As some of you may know, I went to see
the movie “A Thin Line Between Love and
Hate,” last weekend. Not that the movie
intrigued me—however, it did. Both Martin
Lawrence’s and Bobby Brown’s characters
were bent on competition for the other to
say, “You’re the man!” Well, who’s the man?
In recent movies, women have been
depicted as getting even with men who have
done them wrong. First, it was “Waiting to
Exhale,” with the car burning scene and now
this movie. It was really strange and scary to
notice the glare and glistening in every
woman’s eyes at the movie theater. When

Thursday, April 11, 1996

Lynn Whitfield was making Martin Lawrence’s life miserable, ladies had that
look like, “Yeah, that’s a good idea.”
Men, let me just say that 1996 might be called “The year that women got
even with men.” Or as my father use to say, “They ‘re mad as hell, and they ’re
not gonna to take it anymore!” So, if you see cars in Tower Lake all of a
sudden exploding, you know why. And the fun part is that individual will get
to be in the Alestle Police Brief section with the famous phrase, “Police are
continuing their investigation.”
So men, lets make our lives easier and buy our significant others roses
every now and again, massage her back, and for God sake’s man, put the
toilet seat down! (The ultimate sacrifice.) However, if you want to play the
game and have more than one woman, don’t go crying to your friends or your
dog, Spot. Because in the words of one of my favorite blues songs “It’s
cheaper to keep her!”

For th e A le s tle

i t is a warm spring day with jo y a n d laughter in th e air. The sun is
shining, th e birds are chirping, and a m an with a so n g in his h e a rt and
a sm ile on his face, is doing w hat h e d o e s b e st ... singing his h eart
out. A celebration w as underw ay for th e younger an d o ld er generation
of Edwardsville uniting a s friends.
The Cougar C ubs, from s p e e c h com m unication class 2 0 1 , were
assigned to work to g eth e r a s a group, to do so m eth in g beneficial for
th e p eo p le in th e com m unity a n d for th e com m unity itself. The Cougar
C ubs d ecided since they w ere th e younger g eneration, they w anted to
w elcom e th e resid e n ts from Rosew ood Care C enter (the o lder
generation) to th eir college com m unity.
This w as m ad e p o ssib le d u e to th e dedication and hard work of
Sean Pohl, A nnette Tucker, Corey Sm ith, Pam Voss, Britt H orstm ann
and Kelley Schirm er (alias "Cougar Cubs"). The six s tu d e n ts worked
side by sid e with Q retta Sullivan, activities c o o rd in ato r a t Rosewood
Care Center.
"We have had birthday p arties and played bingo in th e past, but
w hat th e s e s tu d e n ts pulled off will b e a m em ory th a t will last a
lifetime, in th e m inds and h e a rts of e a ch o n e o f th e resid en ts th a t
a tte n d e d th e show," Sullivan said.
Sullivan said th a t a t social functions only a b o u t five resid e n ts o u t of
sixty-two a tte n d . A record of twenty five resid e n ts a tte n d e d th e Cougar
C u b 's party.
"The resid e n ts w ere so delighted to s e e young faces. They could not
believe they w ere th e re to en te rta in them ," Sullivan said.
The sta r of th e party w as Charlie Mack, a singer by day and a dollh c u s e builder by night. While he sings in ch u rch es, hospitals and
restau ran ts, his speciality is nursing h o m es a n d rehabilitation cen ters.
Mack, 66, retired from M onsanto chem ical com pany after 34 years
of working various jo b s . R ather th an retiring to do nothing, he tu rn ed
his en ergies to perform ing.
'I t g ets m e o u t o f th e h o u se a n d gives m e so m eth in g to do," Mack
said.
Mack brought a sm ile to e a ch an d every face a t Rosew ood Care
C enter th a t w arm spring day. Me san g all th e oldies but goodies. He
greeted th e w om en with "Hi sw eeth eart," a n d "Hi th e re doll." He sh o o k
h an d s with th e m en a n d called th em "brother" o r "partner."
As Mack perfo rm ed , th e a u d ie n c e clap p ed a n d sa n g aloud with him.
Pam Voss, a C ougar C ub said, 'I t is so cool to s e e th e o ld er generation

having a good tim e with th e younger g eneration." It is to o bad th a t we
do n ot tak e tim e o u t of o u r s c h e d u le s to d o this m ore often.
Corey Sm ith said th a t h e w as going to b e a vo lu n teer a t Rosewood.
"Participating in th is com m unity p ro ject not only gave en joym ent to
th e resid en ts, but it really m ad e m e feel good too," Sm ith said.
As Charlie Mack san g so n g s like "King of th e Road" an d "Sixteen
Tons," he m oved aro u n d th e room . He stre tc h e d into th e crow d a s far
a s th e m icro p h o n e would let him.
At o n e point Mack s e t th e m icro p h o n e dow n an d d a n c ed with Kelley
Schirm er, also a C ougar Cub.
"Man, h e can really d an ce. He twirled m e aro u n d so m any tim es, I
had to sit down I w as so dizzy," S chirm er said.
Mack perform ed for an hour. When th e show w as over, th e Cougar
C ubs played five ro u n d s o f bingo with th e resid en ts. After e ach round
a prize w as provided for th e winner.
"They w ere all w inners in my book," said Britt H orstm ann. "I never
realized how se rio u s bingo w as to th e o ld er g en eration."
Pohl w as th e a n n o u n c e r of bingo. He had tro u b le reading so m e of
th e letters and n u m b ers. The ladies of Rosew ood te a s e d him all
aftern o o n for calling th e n u m b ers and letters too slow. During bingo
o n e o f th e resid e n ts gave Pohl a m agnifying glass and told him th a t he
b e tte r u se it.
Pohl said th a t he really enjoyed him self.
"This ju s t w asn 't a pro ject th a t I had to d o for o n e o f my c la sse s. I

"It was a real delight getting to know this lady and being h er p artn er

Along with aw arding th e resid e n ts with prizes, th e C ougar C ubs

‘James and the Giant Peach’ to open nationwide on Friday
(Press Release)

“James and the Giant Peach,” starring Joanna Lumley, Miriam
Margoyles and featuring the voice talent of Richard Dreyfuss, Susan
Sarandon, Jane Leeves and David Thewlis, is currently slated to open
nationwide Friday, April 12.
Ripe with the spirited fun, imagination and magic of Roald Dahl’s
classic fantasy, Walt Disney Pictures’ juicy big-screen version follows the
exciting journey of a lonely young boy who finds some unusual new friends
and unexpected adventures when he climbs inside a giant peach and sets
sail for New York City. Bursting with comedy, fantasy, drama and
memorable music, the film utilizes a variety of cinematic techniques
ranging from stylized live-action sequences to awesome stop-motion
animation combined with the most sophisticated special effects to tell its
story.
Since the initial publication of James and the Giant Peach in 1961, this
best-loved and best-selling tale has captured the fancy of several
generations of readers and continues to be one of the most popular books

away in 1990, but when his widow, Liccy (Felicity), was approached by
director Henry Selick about turning James into a film, she was so impressed
with the magical stop-motion world he and his team had created for “The Nightmare Before Christmas” that she agreed to let him
make the film. Three years later, the fruit of their labors are on display, in one of the most visually exciting and enormously
entertaining films in recent times, “James and the Giant Peach.”

Softball splits with UM SL then beats USI
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter

Jeremy Paschall/A/esf/e
First baseman Christi Perry takes a snap throw to first trying to pick off the runner in
the first game of a doubleheader Wednesday afternoon against Southern Indiana
at Cougar Field. SIUE prevailed in the first game 8-0.

A lack-luster performance caused
the SIUE softball team to split a
doubleheader with Missouri-St.
Louis on Tuesday at ABC Park in St.
Louis but rebounded against
Southern Indiana on Wednesday.
The Cougars, now 28-9 on the
year, defeated UMSL in the first
game 4-2. Three early SIUE errors let
UMSL jump out to a 2-0 lead after
the first inning, but the Cougars
cleaned up their act to prevail.
Kim Darrow of Washington, 111.,
and Jennifer Smith from Collinsville
combined for four of SIUE’s seven
hits in the game.
Freshman
Jessica
Silbe
of
Pinckneyville recorded her seventh
victory in a row to improve her
overall record to 12-6.
In game two, the Cougars could
only muster one run on five hits as
they fell 7-1.
Sophomore Deanna Smith of
Morton took the loss which puts her
record on the mound at 10-3 for the
season.
“We played the worst we’ve
played all year,” said head coach
Sandy Montgomery on Wednesday
over the phone. “We were lucky to
split these games.”

Missouri-St. Louis will join the
Great Lakes Valley Conference next
season.
Montgomery said, “Hopefully we
can use the loss to put us in check.”
The Cougars rebounded from the
second loss against Missouri-St.Louis
when they defeated Southern
Indiana Wednesday afternoon at
Cougar Field 8-0 in the first game of
a doubleheader.
A strong pitching performance by
Silbe and some live Cougar bats
contributed in the victory.
“We just hit the ball really well
today...And when we play as well as
we can, then we can beat anybody in
the nation,” Montgomery said after
the game. “We have a lot of good
players out there and when we get
going we can really go.”
Under cloudless blue skies
Wednesday, the Cougars started off
slow at the plate but got in the grove
in final three innings where they
scored all eight runs.
J. Smith led the way going 3 for 4
with 3 R B I’s followed by Michele
Sucich with an 2 for 4 day with an
RBI and Kim Messinger having a 3
for 3 game also with an RBI.
J. Smith also helped pad her
batting average raising it to .458 for
the season.

Missouri-St. Louis hands
Cougars fifth loss in a row
By Ell Savoie
Sports Editor

Getting hits was not a problem for
the SIU E baseball team Tuesday
afternoon. Scoring runs with those hits
however, was a problem.
The Cougars collected 18 hits off of
four Missouri-St. Louis pitchers, but
only scored seven runs in a 12-7 loss.
The loss was the Cougars’ fifth in a row
and dropped their overall record to 1915.
“Hits are a m atter of when you get
them,” disgruntled Cougar Head Coach
Gary Collins said after the game.
“We’ve really failed to get timely
hitting, and by the same token, we’ve
been failing to get timely pitching, too.”
The Cougars, like the Rivermen, used
four pitchers in a game that featured a
lot of offense. The Cougars fourth
pitcher, freshman Jason Guest took the
loss to drop to 4-1 on the season.
John Spotanski led the Cougar
offense with four hits while Mark Briggs
had three and Jeff Silvey, Mark Burris,
Brian Geluck and Jeff Ridenour had
two apiece.
The game was a seesaw affair early
and the Cougars were on top 6-5 going
into the seventh, but UMSL struck for
three runs in the inning to take an 8-6
lead that they never relinquished. The

big hit in the inning was a two-run triple
off the bat of Tim May that one-hopped
the center-field fence.
“I didn’t think it was that bad of a
pitch,” Collins said about the May triple.
“It was down ... he just went down and
got it.”
The Cougars did not give up easily
though as they got back within one at 87 in the eighth, but the Rivermen got
four in the ninth inning to put the game
away.
“That killed us, that ninth inning.
When you’re only down one run you
have a lot different attitude when you
go up there,” Collins said.
However, the ninth inning didn’t
disappoint Collins as much as the early
innings.
“The problem was that the first five
runs they scored were guys that we
either walked or hit,” he said.
The Cougars will have a chance to
redeem themselves for the Tuesday loss
as they travel to St. Louis today to take
on the ninth-ranked Rivermen once
again.
Collins is looking for someone to
step up and pull the team out of their
current skid.

SIUE intramural program
holding first golf scramble

April is Alcohol Awareness Month
Be aware o f the reasons NOT to binge* drink.
Binge Drinkers are:

By Roy Gilmore
Editor in Chief

The Masters is a tradition in golf unlike any other...well until
now. SIUE Intramurals is beginning its own tradition with the
first ever Intramural Golf Scramble.
Students, faculty, staff and spouses of the aforementioned
are all eligible to compete in the 9-hole links challenge.
John Bell, director of intramurals, is expecting anywhere
from 12-16 foursomes to compete in this inaugural event.
“Since this idea developed through student suggestions, I
expect there will be substantial participation from the students
and faculty and staff alike,” Bell said.
The scramble, which is scheduled for Tuesday, April 23 at
Oakbrook Golf Course in Edwardsville, will consist of four
person teams divided into two pairs. Each pair will play a best
ball 9-hole scramble. The score of each pair for each team will
be added together for the team score.
Prizes will be awarded for best total team score and
additional prizes will be awarded to the longest drive and
closest to the pin on selected holes, as well as the lowest score
for a pair.
Tee times will be posted by 5 p.m. on April 19 and team
managers are responsible for finding out what time their tee
times are. Also, teams can request tee times and they will be
given out on a first come, first serve basis.
The cost for the event is $10 per person to walk and $15 per
person for a cart. To rent a cart, one of the golfers must be 21
years of age and there will only be two people to each cart.
“This event will be awarding points to the All Sport
Trophies,” Bell said. “So I encourage all teams to send a
representative out to collect more points for your
organization.”

Softball_______________________________________

Along with some good hitting Silbe worked all six innings
of the game. Due to the eight run rule after five innings the
game was shortened.
“She has a lot of potential. I think she is 13-8 or
something like that and I’m really pleased with her,”
Montgomery said.
SIUE will travel to Kenosha, Wis., over the weekend to
battle the GLVC’s first place team Wisconsin-Parkside on
Saturday and St. Joseph’s College on Sunday.
The Cougars will play two games against both of these
teams which have only one loss in the conference and are
tied for first place. If the Cougars play well this weekend
they could possibly land themselves in the top spot of the
GLVC.
