President’s problems spark lively class discussions on presidential ethics
LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) President Clinton’s links to
former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky are making for
some interesting discussions in
civics classes in Kentucky’s high
schools and colleges.
Dealing with the more
salacious
details
of
the
controversy is a trickier task for
high school teachers.
“I, like the president, choose
my words very carefully,” said

Raymond Webb, a Frankfort
High School political science
teacher.
Webb spent one class last
week answering questions about
Clinton. “I just try to focus on the
impeachable offenses.”
Senior Kim Aniton said “it’s
interesting to see how they judge
the president on his personal
life.”
At Franklin County High
School, civics teacher Sonya

Gardner used her planning period
pulling the latest Clinton articles
off the Internet, including a large
picture of Lewinsky.
“They’re very interested,” she
said of her students. "B u t we’re
trying to focus on the character
and role of the presidency.”
For University of Kentucky
students studying the presidency
and the media, the allegations
against Clinton provide excellent
discussion topics.

“Last week, we were talking
about the dynamics of the
presidency. Who would have
known that President Clinton
would be able to change them
faster than
anyone could
imagine?” said Professor Donald
Gross.
The effects the alleged scandal
would have on the presidency _
Clinton’s in particular and those
in the future _ dominated his
American
Presidency
and

Federal Executive class for its
one hour and 15 minutes.
“As immoral as it is that
(Clinton) had an affair, the real
legal issues are whether he
obstructed justice, and that tends
to get blurred when people talk
about this,” said Thomas Harper,
23, of Cadiz.

Wash. (AP) - Two robbers
burst through the front door of a
home and robbed an elderly
couple of $200 at knifepoint
before locking them in a closet,
the Clallam County sheriff’s
office said Tuesday.
The robbers threatened to cut
the couple’s throats if they didn’t
cooperate, deputies said.

Deputies searched for two
men, one described as heavyset
with chubby cheeks in his 30s
and the other in his 20s, after an
84-year-old man and his wife, 79,
broke out of the closet and called
911 Monday night.
“We don’t have these kind of
robberies,” Sheriff Joe Hawe
said. “This is the first forced

residential robbery we’ve had in
years.”
One of the robbers forced the
wife onto the floor and held her
at knifepoint, while the other
robber took the husband through
the house to collect money,
sheriff’s officers said.

“This aids the teaching of
government because if the
teacher facilitates the class
properly you know when to
connect it to other topics,” he
said.
The alleged scandal and media
coverage have provided an ideal
case study at UK’s School of
Journalism
and
Telecommunications,
said
director Buck Ryan. “I asked my
introduction
to
journalism
students
to
critique
the
coverage,” he said.
“Several students said the
focus on the speculation and the

use of unnamed sources was not
only a problem for accuracy and
the public but for the media as
well,” he said, adding that some
students called the coverage a
feeding frenzy.
Ryan took a straw poll, asking
his students how the story would
end.
“About 60 of the 85 said they
believed it would disappear into
nothingness when all was said
and done,” Ryan said.
“And not a single one said
they thought the president would
be impeached.”

CLASS---------from page 1
Some students were less
concerned about the morality of
the president’s alleged acts than
about the effect on his ability to
govern. Some said Americans
had already accepted Clinton’s
sexual escapades.
“But I think it boils down to
trust,” said Rob Herbst, 21 of
Des Plaines, 111.
“I mean, if all the allegations
prove to be true, it makes you
wonder how stupid can you be.”
Scott County High School
teacher Jay Asher was discussing
women in politics when the news
broke.

Excuses aren’t necessary in the "real world”
Human error, inaccuracy,
I problems. They all exist in the
world of business. The difference
I between the real world and the
\ Alestle: in the real world, one gets
Ifired. The A lestle is supposed to be
I about learning and teaching lessons,
and applying these lessons to
'journalism . Here an aspiring
Danielle Belton journalist can gain experience of
how a newspaper is run, how to run
it efficiently and how to handle news.
I suppose that it is easy to pass judgment on the
paper, the mistakes are often obvious and harm the very
credibility of a newspaper. Although I, for one, am not
asking for any sort of leniency. How are students (we at
the Alestle) supposed to learn if we don’t allow the
teachers (the public at large) to correct our papers? Since
many of you are fairly decent teachers, we get a fair
share of helpful criticism.
Strangely, in this editorial, I quite don’t know what
I’m asking for. Patience? Critics could argue that these
problems have been occurring for sometime now and
that they have been very patient while waiting for
improvement. I could argue that the problem didn’t
develop overnight, therefore one cannot fix it overnight.
The results of change will be slow and steady with
uneven points that dip back into mediocracy, but

eventually lead to improvement. Most changes will not
occur in a matter of minutes.
Perhaps I could be asking for understanding, but
how can one ask someone to understand something one
has to experience? A critic could say, you have copy
editors, section editors and an editor in chief, how could
you miss something as obvious as the date, as we did last
Thursday? I could say it’s hard to notice things like that
when you’ve been in classes for five hours, then spend
eight hours working on the paper. One tends to become
fatigued. Unfortunately, that would be just an excuse,
and I don’t want to give excuses anymore than the public
wants to hear them. I could say that we’re overworked
and understaffed, but that song has been sung since the
summer of 1997. Quite frankly, I believe the campus has
long gone mute on that point.
Since I am one to believe that a newspaper reflects
society, I will believe that the campus of SIUE sees this
paper no differently than any other paper. They don’t
care about the A lestle’s problems and aren’t thinking
about them as they read the paper. They see it for what it
is, in black and white. They are not pondering whether
we stayed in the office all night putting out the paper. No
one is thinking of that as they hold the paper in their
hands. To the reader, we are invisible and not a negative
word will utter from the reader’s lips unless an unusual
stimuli disrupts the reading. When there is a mistake, the
paper is suddenly noticed; we then lose our invisability.

Black History Month is fast
approaching and the Alestle is looking
for editorials and editorial cartoons on
race relations and black history to be
featured in the Editorial section.
Please send your letters to the Alestle
on the second floor of the University
Center, with name, phone number,
social security number and signature.
Letters missing the above WILL NOT
be printed. For more information
contact Danielle Belton at 3528.

Correction
The Jan. 27, 1998 issue of the Alestle contained an error in the
article titled “Misconceptions and improper condom...” Dr. Lee
Johnson was improperly referred to as the director of Health
Service when in actuality this position is held by Claretha Bryant.
Johnson is a member of the Physical Medical Chief Staff. The
Alestle apologizes for this error.
Letters to the edttor policy:
The editors, staff and publishers o f the Alestle believe in
the free exchange o f ideas, concerns and opinions and will
publish a s many letters to the editor a s possible. All letters
should be typed and double-spaced and be no longer then
5 0 0 words. Please include your phone number, s t a t u r e
and social security number.
We reserve the right to edit letters for grammar and
content However, great care will be taken to ensure that the
m essage of the letter is not lost or altered.

We should be an unobtrusive news source, but the
minute we fail, our invisibility is gone. We are no
different than the power company which becomes highly
noticeable only when the lights go out. One will enjoy
something as long as it’s consistent and reliable.
Eventually, the service will be taken for granted and
become commonplace. Yet, the minute there is a gliche
in the system, the problem becomes as obvious as
daylight.
Therefore, I suppose that this could be considered
an apology for being visible when we should be a little
more inconspicuous like all newspapers should be. We
will strive to do that. But it is going to take some time
and some help. I’m asking the readers and the public to
continue their criticism because, like I said before, the
public is our teacher and we are so thirsty for
knowledge. If you’d, like to join us and become part of
us, please do. We’d appreciate the help.
Lastly, I’d like to encourage all to continue to read
the Alestle. Hopefully, we’ll both see good things in the
future. After all, this letter is as much to the public as it
is to ourselves. We’re not here to give excuses, we’re
here to give the news: professionally, accurately, and
reliably.

Letters to the editor
Alestle reporting goes ‘a fools way’ with
inaccurate account of amphitheater issue
The SIUE newspaper, “the Alestle” has in the past
been a fool to teach students about journalism and
unbiased reporting to the community, to dig out the
truth not to make-up something to agree with the SIU
management but report accurately all sides of this very
important issue; of taking prime farm land and
potentially the only open spaces between Ed’s mills and
the environment of the development of Smego Industry.
On Jan. 22 (by the way, we are in 1998, not 1997,
haven’t you got a person there that can check these
gross errors before they go to print) the photo of the
Sonic Inc. doing a sound check, and goes on to say “for
the new amphitheater being built.” Is not accurate at all
and is either written in complete ignorance
or written with an unacceptable bias.
Lets do it right, do it fairly and let us, the readers,
judge — not the reporters or the editors.

DAYTON, Ohio (AP) - The
father of a 15-year-old student
who was suspended after wearing
tongue jewelry to school filed a
federal lawsuit against the school
board Tuesday.
The lawsuit was filed in U.S.
District Court by Michael Dyer
Sr. against the Tecumseh Local
Board of Education in New
Carlisle.
The lawsuit said Michael Dyer
Jr., a ninth-grade student at
Tecumseh High School, has been
suspended from school four
separate times totaling 25 days
for failing to obey a school
administrator’s order.
Dyer refused to open his
mouth or to remove the jewelry
pierced to his tongue, the lawsuit
said.
“Michael Dyer dresses in a
particular manner, incorporating
body pierces, tattoos and unique
hair styles, in order to express his
adherence to a ‘straightedge’
philosophy against the use of
legal and illegal drugs and

against promiscuous sexual
activity and in favor of original
and creative thought,” the lawsuit
says.
According to the lawsuit, Dyer
was suspended three times even
though the school had no rule
against body jewelry. By the
fourth time, the school had such a
rule, but it was approved by the
school board without allowing
the standard four-week comment
period, the lawsuit said.
A call to the school board was
met with no answer. There was
no telephone listing for school
Superintendent Roger Pankake.
Messages left for Tecumseh High
School
principal
Michael
Ostendorf were not immediately
returned.
According to the lawsuit,
Dyers’ constitutional rights to
free expression and to be free
from unreasonable searches were
violated. The lawsuit asks for
unspecified damages against the
school board.

Two Utah teen-agers charged
with dumping insecticide in
gym during basketball game
LOGAN, Utah (AP) - Two
teen-agers have been charged
with creating a public nuisance
for allegedly dumping a bottle of
insecticide under the bleachers
during a basketball game at the
Mountain Crest High School.
The two 17-year-olds were
charged with the class B
misdemeanor for the incident
during the Jan. 14 game against
Sky View High School in
Hyrum. The gym had to be
evacuated shortly after the game
ended when officials discovered
the source of a foul, sulfurous
odor that had been noticeable
since halftime. The Cache
County Sheriff’s Office reported
it was malathion, a toxic

S o u t h e r n

Illin o is

insecticide.
The compound was contained
and disposed of by the Cache
County Fire Department.
“I’m sure the youths saw this
as a harmless joke, but anytime
people are exposed to poison
such as this was, it constitutes a
serious situation and will be
dealt
with resolutely
by
authorities,”
Sheriff Lynn
Nelson said in a news release.
Alan
Roe,
an
insect
diagnostician at Utah State
University, said malathion is not
a particularly strong pesticide,
and it is unlikely those exposed
will suffer lasting effects.

LIFESTYLE STRINGER

The first in a series of the quasi-home invasion of Woodland Hall

Sandy Schlosser/Alestle

The Woodland Hall room o f Melissa Woolever and Amy Wilson is covered
with wacky posters, bean bags and a giant lette r “E.”

Two beds, two desks and a closet can
describe every room in Woodland Hall. What
makes a room a home?
Every individual has some type of unique
thing about him or her. These individuals,
when looked at as a whole, make up SIUE’s
Woodland Hall.
This is the first submission of the “What’s
in your Room?” contest. Periodically, the
Alestle will publish a picture of a room to show
the true uniqueness of the individuals
on campus.
Nintendo, stuffed animals, Mickey Mouse,
Mountain Dew cans, yearbooks, a poster of
Barbie throughout the years, glow in the dark
ghosts with hanging candy canes and more
make Room 3-North a home.
This room is the temporary home of
Melissa Woolever and Amy Wilson. With a
blue beanbag chair and a back rocker,
Woolever and Wilson can watch television
comfortably. “I like how comfortable I can be
while doing homework,” stated Woolever.
Roommate Wilson added, “My beanbag chair
makes it feel more like home.” This response
was quite predictable. When asked why she
had to have her beanbag chair here, Wilson
replied, “I have a moveable bed. I just drag my

Ringworm: the ‘grungy fungi’ can be prevented
■ BY STEPHEN WHITE
LIFESTYLE REPORTER
You’ve just finished taking a hot shower at the
gym. You grab your towel and quickly scrub every
nook and cranny of your body. Suddenly you notice
that your feet are swelling and they itch like crazy.
You curse yourself for not having worn sandals
at a public shower stall and put on your Jockey
shorts. Thoroughly grossed out, you decide to head
home where you can scratch your feet in private.
But the worst is yet to come because the next
time you change your underwear you find that the
red, inflamed itchy spots aren’t just between your
toenails and the soles of your feet, but have spread
to your groin.
You have jock itch.
Does this sound familiar? If it does, you’re
not alone in your misery. Anyone can get athlete’s
foot or jock itch. But how exactly does the
infamous “grungy fungi” wreak its havoc on the
human body?
According to the Merck medical manual,
athlete’s foot and jock itch are superficial fungal
infections caused by dermatophytes — fungi that
invade only dead tissues of the skin, hair and nails.
Both athlete’s foot and jock itch are two of the
more common types of skin infection known
as ringworm.
Ringworm can exist on just about any other area
of the body as well, including the scalp and nails.
Since there are so many species of fungi that cause
the disease, immunity is impossible. Therefore,
knowing the symptoms is of key importance.
In ringworm of the foot, symptoms include

scaling and cracking of the skin, especially
between the toes. Ringworm of the body appears as
flat, spreading ring-shaped areas. The edge is
reddish and may be either dry and scaly or moist
and crusted.
Ringworm of the scalp can cause temporary
baldness, leaving scaly patches. Infected hairs
become brittle and break off easily. In severe
ringworm cases, infected nails become thicker,
discolored and brittle, or they can become chalky
and disintegrate.
The key to stopping ringworm is prevention.
Never share towels, hats or clothing with an
infected individual and always practice good
hygiene. Use a powerful, anti-bacterial soap and
pay special attention to washing your feet.
Dermatophytes can live indefinitely in almost any
environment, but they breed more readily in
warmer environments where there is greater
moisture.
The good news is that most cases of ringworm
can be successfully treated with over-the-counter
remedies. The bad news is that science has yet to
invent a cure. So prevention and early detection are
a must. By the time you realize you have ringworm,
you may have been infected for the past 10 to 14
days or longer.
Every semester, Health Services treats several
SIUE students for ringworm. Many, but not all of
these cases, could be prevented or curtailed by
good hygiene and an awareness of the people or
inanimate objects that harbor dermatophytes.
In the war against “grungy fungi,” the best
weapons to use against dreaded ringworm are
knowledge and prevention.

chair into another room and get comfortable.”
Decorating the walls of one’s room adds a
lot to the atmosphere of the room. When one
walks into this room, colorful streamers tend to
be the first thing to attract the eye. Posters such
as: 101 Dalmations, the group DC Talk,
“Romeo and Juliet,” Growing Up Barbie, John
Michael Montgomery, Psychochihuahua and
Mickey Mouse are only some of the wall
decorations. Personal photos, artwork. and
the letter “E” also help cover up the four
white walls.
Wait a minute! Why would there be a big
letter E on someone’s wall? “It reminds me of
my boyfriend,” Amy Wilson replied. It is a
very unique decoration, and it has a memorable
meaning for the girl that resides in the room.
As a part of the contest, one mystery
question is asked after all contest qualifications
have been met. The following was the mystery
question for contestants number one: “What
CD is in your CD player right now?” Melissa
Woolever simply stated, “Screám.” This also
happens to be a favorite movie of hers. Amy
Wilson answered, “Wow!” a CD of the best
1996 Christian music, hence the Christian
posters on her wall.
If you live in Woodland Hall and would like
your room featured in “What’s In Your
Room?,” contact Sandy Schlosser or Corey
Stulce at the Alestle at 3528.

SIUE adds first women’s golf team to roster
■ BY SARAH FINLEY
SPORTS EDITOR
SIUE will be adding its 15th
intercollegiate sport to their
roster effective fall of 1998. The
first-ever women’s golf team will
be adding their name to the
history books.
“A new women’s golf
program will further increase the
athletic opportunities available to
women and bring the university
closer to its gender equality

goals,” athletic director Cindy
Jones said.
The new team will be
competing in the Great Lakes
Valley Conference like the other
14 sports on campus. The GLVC
will hold an inaugural women’s
golf championship next fall in
which the Cougars will compete
along with six other teams from
the conference.
Since SIUE does not have the
facilities to hold a golf team, the
team will be practicing and

competing at the Spencer T. Olin
Community Golf Course in
Alton.
“We are happy the Spencer T.
Olin has come on board with
SIUE Athletics. We look forward
to beginning our relationship
with one of the area’s finest golf
facilities,” Jones said.
The team will carry a full load
of seven or eight players. Jones
said
that
there
will
be
scholarships, but no full rides.
“The scholarships will be

Cougars to battle for third place tie
in GVLC conference; face Quincy
and Southern Indiana this weekend
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Every conference game is
important with the Great Lakes
Valley Conference tournament
quickly approaching, but none
more important than this
weekend’s pair of games.
The SIUE men’s basketball
team
will
renew
its
biggest rivalry when it invades
Quincy, but not before tonight’s
clash with the nation’s No. 7
ranked team, Southern Indiana.
Southern
Indiana
(17-3
overall, 7-3 GLVC) will be
hungry for revenge after SIUE
stunned them 96-86 at the
Vadalabene Center on Jan. 8.
Head
coach
Jack
Margenthaler expects these
match-ups
to
be
highly
competitive.
“Those will be two tough
games. First, because they are
road games and second, because
we gave Southern Indiana a
conference loss earlier this

Women’s b-ball on collision
course with Screaming Eagles
USI out to avenge loss and regain bragging
■ BY JASON TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER

The University of Southern
Indiana is on top of the Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference
standings and tonight they are
on a collision course with the
Cougar Women’s basketball
team in Evansville, Ind.
The 16-6 Screaming Eagles
of USI lost to SIUE in their first
meeting
74-66
at
the
Vadalabene Center on Jan. 8.
Now 9-1 in the conference, USI
is out to make their second
meeting with SIUE look like
a fluke.
“We have a big game with
USI Thursday,” Cougar head
coach Wendy Hedbeg said. “We
have a huge rivalry with them.
They have revenge on their
minds and they have a lot
to prove.”
The Cougars are aiming to
keep the consistency up and are
tied for the second place spot
with Lewis and Northern
Kentucky. At 13-5 overall and
8-2 in the GLVC race with three
players
averaging
double
figures in points, the Cougars

aren’t planning on giving over
the win to USI so easily.
“We have so many games
left, and every one of them is
big,” Hedberg said.“I am happy
where we are, and some games
went our way this weekend, but
this thing is far from over.”
SIUE’s junior forward Kim
Lowe is averaging
10.9
rebounds and 13.1 points per
game. When Lowe has a big
game on the boards the Cougars
are tough to beat. She’s had
more than ten rebounds in eight
games and SIUE has won 6 of
those 8 games.
Freshman guard Misi Clark
is averaging 17.4 points a game
and has 61 steals on the season.
Those steals have resulted in a
lot of lay-ups for the Cougar
newcomer and she is number
four on the team in free throw
shooting at 63 percent.
Saturday the Cougars will
end the four contest road trip
facing the Quincy University
Hawks for a 5p.m. game. The
Hawks are winless in GLVC
competition this year and
feature senior 6 ’ 1” center Laura
Sorenson in the post.

LaFontaine has a thousand reasons to feel good, joins scoring elite
NEW YORK (AP) — Joining the 1,000-point club was
probably more meaningful for Pat LaFontaine than most
NHL players.
It wasn’t only that the New York Rangers’ center had
become the 50th player in history to reach the milestone
when he had a goal and an assist last week against the
Philadelphia Flyers. Just as important to LaFontaine, he
was still playing at a high level consistent with his career.
After all, this is a comeback year for LaFontaine, who
missed most of last season because of a concussion.
“It is a special feeling to achieve something like that,
especially when I did not think I would have that
opportunity last year at this time,” said LaFontaine, who
joined Joey Mullen and Phil Housley as Americans
reaching the 1,000-point plateau.
LaFontaine, acquired by the Rangers just before the
season from the Buffalo Sabres, is currently the team’s

leading scorer with 20 goals and 32 assists in 51 games.
His performance has won him a spot on the United
States’ Olympic roster for the Olympics, and tabbed him
as a prime candidate for the Masterton Trophy, the NHL
award for comeback player of the year. With only 13
minor penalties so far, LaFontaine also could be
considered for the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly
conduct on the ice.
“He’s played hard for us, he loves playing in the city
here, the fans are great to him and it’s a well deserved
honor for the adversity he’s battled through,” teammate
Wayne Gretzky says of LaFontaine reaching the 1,000point milestone.
Some people called him foolish to try a comeback after
a serious head injury, despite the $4.8 million salary. It
was not the first concussion of LaFontaine’s career.
But LaFontaine, a gritty 5-foot-10, 180-pounder, stood

up under the punishment. The 32-year-old LaFontaine has
been wearing a helmet with extra padding and
a mouthguard which, he says, helps to protect
against concussions.
Rangers coach Colin Campbell said the Philadelphia
game is further proof of LaFontaine’s success.
“He competed well against a big team and that’s been
the big question in his comeback,” Campbell said.
LaFontaine played eight seasons with the New York
Islanders after a stint with the U.S. team at the 1984
Olympics. He spent six years in Buffalo before his trade
to the Rangers.
After 849 games, he has scored 1,003 points (465
goals, 538 assists).
“He’s played aggressive, he’s answered back and
his physical play mirrors his point production,”
Campbell said.

Former Kamikaze to ring sacred bell at Olympics
NAGANO, Japan (AP) — When Motoichi Godo was
17, he didn’t think he would live out the year. A new
recruit in the summer of 1945, he was assigned to a unit
of human torpedoes, the Japanese Imperial Navy’s version
of the notorious kamikaze.
But Japan’s surrender saved his life. And Godo, now
69, is to play a special role in what he sees as a major
celebration of world peace — the Nagano Winter
Olympics.
Godo is to participate in a sacred bell-ringing
ceremony this weekend at the Zenko-ji temple, one of the
oldest Buddhist centers in this country and a sort of patron
temple for this city of 360,000 where the games begin
Feb. 7.
“It’s a very special privilege,” he said from the small
room in the temple’s main hall where he works as a lay
assistant to its dozens of priests and monks.
Godo is to ring the temple’s 7-foot-tall bronze bell
throughout the day Saturday in a ritual of prayer. In

accordance with Buddhist beliefs, he will wish for the
success of the games, and the happiness and health of
all people.
“Because of my past, I have a special feeling about
peace,” he said. “The war that I fought in should never
happen again.”
Godo, with a head of thick gray hair and the weathered
face of a farmer, still carries with him a photo of the unit
he was assigned to and the official orders that sent him to
an almost certain death.
His unit was responsible for guarding a strip of
coastline with torpedoes that required a human pilot. It
was a one-way trip.
“I remember my commander telling me when I
reported for duty that my life was in his hands,” Godo
said. “We all knew that it was our job to blow up both
ourselves and our subs.”
Before he got his orders to pilot one of the torpedoes,
the war ended on Aug. 15, 1945.

“We all heard the emperor announce the end of the war
on the radio, but the broadcast was so full of static that we
didn’t understand it,” he said. “We were ready to go fight
the Russians.”
After the war, Godo returned to his life of growing rice
and raising silkworms. Twenty-seven years ago, he began
working for the temple.
“I don’t like to talk about the past,” he said. “I don’t
want people whose loved ones died in the war to be angry
that I am going to ring the bell. I don’t want to open any
old wounds.”
He said the arrival of thousands of athletes, officials
and journalists from around the world for the Feb. 7-22
games symbolizes how much things have changed since
the war.
“We are seeing so many foreigners here at the temple
these days,” he said. “None of this would be possible
without peace.”
