SIUE grad student resigns from internship after
organization’s slow reaction to racial epithet
■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
In the turbulence of today’s
world, racial sensitivity is still a
problem in the workplace.
An SIUE graduate student
resigned from an internship with
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of
Southwestern Illinois March 31,

stating that the organization over
looked a derogatory racial remark
while considering a co-worker’s
promotion to full-time.
Dale Colbert, a graduate
student
in
the
Public
Administration/Policy Analysis
Program at SIUE, was an intern at
Big Brothers-Big Sisters of
Southwestern Illinois, central
office in Bellville, 111. It is one of
the three offices which serve

Bellville, East St. Louis and Alton.
All the offices serve a large
urban minority populaiton. The
co-worker used a racial epithet
while driving Colbert and herself
to pick up door prizes for a fund­
raiser. Colbert resigned after the
co-worker was promoted to a full­
time position without completing
any form of diversity training.
On Feb. 13, 1998, the co­
worker was driving herself and

Colbert back to work when
the co-worker allegedly said
that a man who was tailgating her
car was driving like a "nigger.”
When Colbert asked the co-worker
to
repeat
what
she
said, the co-worker replied that she
didn’t mean it in reference
to Colbert, who is AfricanAmerican.
“I couldn’t believe she just
said that, I lost my breath,” Colbert

Art in University Center reflects talents of
junior high and local art therapy students
■ BY RENEE D. HOLLER
NEWS REPORTER
Two art exhibits featuring the artistic
talents o f SIUE students as well as
elementary and junior high students from
the St. Louis M etropolitan area are
currently on display on the second floor of
the University Center.
The art education program of the
Department of Art and Design invited
kindergarten through ninth grade students
to showcase their artwork in the 24th
Annual Young A rtists’ Exhibition, which is
being displayed on the wall opposite the
University Museum on the second floor of
the University Center.
In addition, the University Museum is
housing “The Art o f Art Therapists:
Growth in Healing,” an art exhibit being

presented by the SIUE Student Art Therapy
Association featuring the work of local art
therapists and their students.
The goal o f the Art Therapy exhibit is
to make students who might not otherwise
know about art therapy become aware of
how art therapy works, according to Sharyl
Parashak, assistant professor of Art and
Design at SIUE.
“We want the public to see how
someone works with an issue and then
creates an image,” she said.
Parashak also hopes that the exhibit
will expose more people to the ideas of the
art therapy program.
“We currently have about 22 students
in the art therapy program,” she said. “Art
therapy is really interesting. It’s where the
expression [of the artist] takes over.”
“I have been really excited about the

range of work displayed,” Bridget Speer,
graduate student in the art therapy
program said. “Art therapy has really
helped me to look not only at my own
experiences, but also at those of the client.”
The Young Artists Exhibit features
approximately 80 works of art and is being
held in conjunction with Young Artist
Month, which is March, according to Dr.
Joseph Weber, professor of Art Education
in the Department of Art and Design.
“The idea [of the exhibit] is to promote
children’s artwork. What better way than to
host an annual exhibit on campus for the
general public to see the children’s
artwork,” he said.
The work on display is created by
students in elementary and middle schools
throughout the area.

said. “The thing is; we got along so
well. We had a good relationship.
It surprised me [because] earlier
that day I said, ‘y°u know, Nicole
is pretty cool, we could be friends,’
then that shot that idea.”
According to Colbert, she was
told by her advisor, Dr. Richard
Bush, that she was the first
African-American to come to
work at the Bellville office since
its opening.

Students
get to “feel
the vibe”
with poetry
■ BY ANTHONY WATT
NEWS STRINGER
The Delta Sigma Theta
sorority’s Delta week began
Monday, March 30 with “Feel the
Vibe II.” Held at 7 p.m. in the
University Center Conference
Room, the event featured poetry
readings. Approximately 50 people
came to hear campus poets share
their work.
“It makes people think,” said
Natasha Lang, president of the
sorority. “Everyone who comes
will be made to think and ponder
questions and will either help
improve their surroundings or at
least be more conscious of them.”
“Feel the Vibe” was first
introduced last fall and was brought
back for Delta Week because of its
popularity. The poets’ subjects
varied from topics of love, sex,
religion, single motherhood, race
issues and society. Nakia Hannon,
planner of the event, got the idea
for the show from the movie,
“Love Jones.”
‘“ Feel the Vibe’ will give
students a chance to share their
talents with others,” Hannon said.
A two dollar admission was
charged and all proceeds will be
donated to a local charity. Other
events during Delta Week have
included a Greek social on
Tuesday, and an African Cultural
museum on Wednesday. A fashion
show will take place this evening at
7 p.m. in the University Center
Conference Room. Delta Week
will conclude on Friday with a
party in the Cougar Den from
10:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. with a cost
of $3 for admission.

When she was employed at
the agency, she was the only
African-American out of the 10
all-woman staff. She was one of
the three A frican-A m ericans
working for Big Brothers-Big
Sisters in the region.
On Feb. 16, Colbert reported
the incident to her supervisor,
Barbara
C em pura,
after
consulting with her adviser, Dr.
Richard Bush o f SIUE. Bush
served as the liaison between
Colbert and Big B rothers-Big
Sisters. Later that week, a
meeting was held to discuss the
incident with C olbert, Bush,
Cempura and the co-worker.
According to Colbert, she
was asked not to tell anyone else
in the office about the incident by
Cempura, and was told that it
should be treated as a personnel
matter. During the meeting, it
was decided that Colbert would
return to w ork under the

condition that thè co-w orker
received some form of diversity
or sensitivity training.
“I explained to [the co­
worker] that I didn’t resent her as
a person, but I resented what she
said,” Colbert said. “I thought she
was my friend. I explained to her
that you can’t exclude people
with that word. W hen you say
‘nigger,’ you call my mother a
nigger, my sister a nigger.”
The co-w orker apologized
during the meeting, but Colbert
felt the apology w asn’t as
genuine because it came four
days after the incident.
“W hen it initially happened,
since she was nice, I decided to
not let this bother me,” Colbert
said. “You don’t want to believe
that people are ugly, but they aie.
Then I was driving home from
Bellville and I thought about it
and I started to cry. That really
hurt my feelings.”
Colbert’s desire to keep this
from
happening
again
to
someone else made her decide to
report the incident to Cempura.

“Many art teachers
who graduated from (the
art education program at)
SIUE are involved in
selecting the work for the
exhibit, and they take a lot
of pride in bringing their

But after the discussion about
sensitivity training for the other
co-worker Colbert decided that it
was fine to return to work on Feb.
26. According to Colbert, after an
uneasy first few days, things at
work were soon back to
“business as usual,” until March
13. During a Friday staff meeting
the
same
co-w orker
was
promoted to a full time position
in special events and marketing at
the agency.
“Everyone’s clapping and
I’m like, ‘I can’t believe this.’”
Colbert said. “I think what upset
rne about this was because she
was still appointed to full time,
and now it made sense why she
didn’t want anyone else to know.
That’s when everything hit me.”
Colbert was shocked that the
co-w orker would receive this
position after an incident of racial
insensitivity occurred and still
had received
no diversity
training. After consulting with
her adviser again and officials at
the university, Colbert decided
that she did not wish to return to

students work to be shown
at their alm a m ater,”
he said.
Both
exhibits
are
open to the general public
and w ill be displayed
through April 6.

Big Brothers-Big Sisters.
“I thought they were being
insensitive and minimizing the
situation,” Colbert said.
Colbert then realized that she
had to do something, believing
that she was the only one taking
the situation seriously. After a
final meeting with Cempura on
March 27 she was informed that
the co-w orker did receive a
written reprim and that would
stay in her file as long as she
worked for the agency, and that
Cempura had discussed with the
co-worker the various rules and
policies o f the organization.
Cempura then informed her that
the co-worker may be enrolled in
some diversity classes at some
point in April.
“I don’t see the severity,”
Colbert said. “I don’t know what
the reprimand says, it could say
anything.”
Colbert com plained that
action was only taken when
she threatened to quit.
Colbert has since quit her job
at the agency as of Wednesday.

She believes that racial issues
such as this should be a priority,
but in her case, it seemed to not
be that way.
“It [racial insensitivity]
needs to be approached in an
organizational matter,” Colbert
said. “That includes me too,
that’s everybody,
not just
black people, white people or
Asian people. You never know
how serious it is till it happens
to you.”
Big Brothers-Big Sisters is a
non-profit, national organization,
active in Illinois since 1980. It
works to match children living
with single parent families, ages
7-14, with adult volunteers.

The art of denial,
Northern style II
In the midst o f winding down while watching
television one evening after coming home from the
Alestle office, I started to watch “The Jerry Springer
Show.” This is something I do often because even
though I know I shouldn't watch it, I do anyway. It’s
Danielle one of life’s guilty pleasures, but this night something
Belton strangely disturbed me.
There was a promotion on for a tomorrow’s show
that featured “Jerry Springer" viewers versus Klu Klux Klan
members, and I was aghast. It usually takes a lot to shock me, but
this truly disturbed me for some reason. The promo featured the
entire guest panel fighting a group of Klansmen in full dress. One
Klansman slammed a woman to the ground as she swung a punch at
him. I watch men take a swing at women all the time on “Jerry
Springer," but this one ju st bothered me. Perhaps it was the fact that
there was no way anyone could deny the fact that the episode was
flat out exploitation.
The show was exuding ignorance. I didn’t bother to watch it the
following night because it sickened me. At least in other episodes
they could pretend to give advice or even have a conversation,
though nothing ever gets resolved, here was an entire episode
dedicated to fighting. The promo featured a black woman saying she
was going to “take two or three of ‘them’ out.” What was this
supposed to solve? There was no inner conflict or pressing secret
that someone wanted to get out in the open. This was an excuse to
have people fight each other in a melee of ignorance.
Some us can think back to when Jerry Springer actually had a
real talk show that was like “Donahue” or other talk shows, where
real subjects were discussed and real issues were brought forth. I
used to love his show. I still remember one episode that feature
children with the HIV virus. It almost made me cry, but then
somewhere along the line, Jerry Springer started to have only
ignorant people, half-naked women, transvestites, freaks and
Klansmen on the show. He featured a “Klan wedding” one episode.
Then there was the cute little blonde haired girl with her own little
gown and hood. And all the male Klansmen do is remind Jerry
Springer that he’s Jewish over and over again, too ignorant to realize
they're not hurting him, they’re helping him get ratings.
So, perhaps that is what disturbed me. I was used to the average
everyday ignorance on the show. I’d become desensitized to it. But
I guess I’ll never be desensitized to a group that is infamous for
murder, destruction and hatred. And the fact that he had regular
people willing to come on television just to fight them. Which was
exactly what the Klan has wanted all along. Every time a Klansman
speaks, he’s talking about a race war. Maybe that’s what the show
was, a prelude to a Klansman’s dream, perhaps.
Therefore, I exercised my right not to watch the show that night
because it’s one thing to know that people hate me and don’t know
me, and it’s another to actually see it in my face. I suppose that I’m
like what I described in my “Racism, Northern style” editorial. If it’s
not in your face, you can pretend like it isn’t really there. So I give
Jerry that much. Because it was there, I couldn’t deny it, could I?

Commentary ---------------------------------------

Gospel concert helps
spread a joyful noise
SIUE students, there is
something spreading around the
campus. It has the power to
resurrect the dead, heal the sick,
free those in bondage and give
victory unto all those who catch
it. It’s not anything that will make
you sick, but it will give you good
health. It’s not something that
will make you ashamed, but it
will make you proud to be who
you are. You better catch it, the
Gospel, the good news of Jesus
Christ.
The Gospel Music Festival
took place on March 27 and 29.
Audrey Johnson of Zeta Phi Beta
and Kisha Sledge o f Rhem a
C hristian
O utreach
Club
sponsored this exciting music
workshop. Audrey and Kisha
decided to work together to offer
the campus a new experience.
This function was not a fund­
raiser. Its divine purpose was to
bring a spiritual awareness of
Jesus Christ through gospel
music for the students and the
community.
Fri., March 27, 1998 the
gospel festival presented a free
gospel music w orkshop (4:30
p.m. in the Illinois Room of the

University
Center).
This
workshop was designed to
strengthen your knowledge about
gospel music. M inister Rodney
Mobley taught the seminar.
Everyone who attended formed
the SIUE choir that presented two
songs the night of the concert.
The student choir did an excellent
job. There is a lot of talent on this
campus. Sun., March 29, 1998
was the night of the Gospel
Explosion. The concert took
place in the Meridian Ballroom of
the University Center at 7:30 p.m.
It was awesome. W hoever missed
this concert m issed out on a
slamming, jam m ing good time.
The program was very
organized. There w ere praise
dancers, soloists and choirs that
preformed. Kisha and Audrey did
an excellent job as M aster of
Ceremonies. The praise dancers
from St. Paul Missionary Baptist
Church glorified the lord through
a powerful and breath taking
dance. We had our very own
M elody Griffin and Audrey
Johnson preform solos, while
Elonda Griffin interpreted the
song through dance. Melody had
the crowd shouting “A m en,”

while Audrey had the crowd
“going over and yonder with the
lord.” The audience was very
involved with the perform ers.
Rolanda Ellis was a soloist who
represented the New Hampshire
Mass Choir. She did a wonderful
job. She was so good that she had
to come back and sing a little
longer. I can’t tell you the name
of the people hearts that were at
the concert. Good is good. There
were other performers who truly
blessed the crowd through their
songs, please forgive me for not
stating all of their names, may
God bless you all.
Last, but not least, we had a
new choir called the “Rapture”
from St. Louis. Amos Issac was
the director and their choir
album/CD will be released in two
weeks called “He Promised.” The
choir
did
an
interesting
performance. I recommend all to
go buy the CD, I think it will
bless you. So, until we meet again
SIUE, catch on to spreading the
good news of Jesus Christ.

Father who suffocated child pleads guilty to murder
GREENSBORO (A P) — A
judge sentenced the father of a 7month-old baby to at least 18
years in prison for the child’s
suffocation — one o f two deaths
in N ovem ber that prom pted
scrutiny o f G uilford C ou n ty ’s
social services.
Efram
Z im berlist “ E ric”
Bennett, 26, pleaded guilty
Monday
to
second-degree
murder in the Nov. 25 death of
Erik Marcel Bennett. A Guilford
County Superior C ourt judge
sentenced him from 18 years,
four m onths to 22 years, 8
months in prison.

Bennett told a police detective
that he held a pillow over the
infant’s face for several minutes
to stop him from crying,
according to prosecutors.
“To suffocate som eone for
four to five minutes with a pillow
over their head devotes an
extreme lack of compassion and a
lack o f hum anity,” Guilford
County District A ttorney Jim
Kimel told the court. “That is an
eternity to have your airways
blocked and die.”
When Bennett removed the
pillow, he noticed the baby
w asn’t breathing, a prosecutor

said in court. He told police that
he rubbed the baby’s back until
he started breathing again. The
baby’s
mother,
Chapelle
Patterson, later came home and
noticed the baby w asn’t breathing
and called an ambulance.
The deaths of Erik and 3w eek-old Chyenne Summer
Kelly during one week in
November led to state and local
reviews of Guilford DSS. Both
children were allowed to remain
in their homes after social
w orkers determ ined that they
would be safe. C hyenne’s mother
is also charged with murder.

Assistant D istrict Attorney
Howard Neumann said Erik had
been abused in the past. He had
old and new bruises on his body
and his collar bone had been
broken a week before his death.
Older fractures in his leg and arm
were never treated and were
healing on their own.
During a sentencing hearing
following his plea, a psychologist
testified that Bennett lacked the
necessary parenting skills needed
to take care of his son. A low IQ
also may have led him to
suffocate his child, Dr. John
Warren III said.

The
bab y ’s
grandfather,
Bobby Lee Patterson Sr., also
spoke on behalf o f the defendant.
But he also said his daughter
knew about her son’s abuse and
did nothing to stop it. She has not
been charged with any crime.
Patterson doesn’t want her to go
to jail, he said, but he wants her
to get psychological help. The
mother, who now lives in
Charlotte, was not in court.
“This young baby had no
reason to be treated as he did,”
Patterson said. “I just ask the
Lord to have mercy on both their
souls, hers and the defendant’s.”

Convicted public aid worker seeks lenient sentence
SPR IN G FIELD , 111. (AP) — A form er Illinois
Department of Public Aid bureau chief convicted of a
fraud charge resulting from the investigation into
Management Services o f Illinois Inc. contracts is seeking
a lenient sentence.
Curtis Fleming contends in federal court documents
filed by his attorney that he was a good employee o f the
Public Aid Department before he got embroiled in a
multimillion dollar state contract scandal.
Fleming also asserts if he hadn’t admitted taking
money and cooperated with prosecutors, the government’s
investigation into MSI might have failed to net any
convictions.
Fleming in 1996 pleaded guilty to single counts of mail

fraud and diversion of funds, charges that carry penalties
of five and 10 years in prison and $250,000 fines. He
resigned his bureau chief position soon after his
indictment in August 1996.
“Mr. Fleming’s failure to consider the interests of the
taxpayers in this one contract is truly a single act of
aberrant behavior occasioned by the enormous political
clout MSI wielded with the upper echelons of state
government,” says the motion filed by Fleming’s attorney,
Daniel Lanterman.
The government has yet to file a response to the
motion, and lead prosecutor Patrick Chesley refused to
comment Monday.
MSI, a computer consulting firm and once one of Gov.

Jim Edgar’s biggest campaign donors, was convicted last
summer of bilking taxpayers out of more than $7 million
under a renegotiated Illinois Department of Public Aid
contract. Neither Edgar nor anyone in his inner circle has
been accused of wrongdoing.
Former MSI co-owner Michael Martin, along with
former Public Aid employee Ronald Lowder, who later
worked for MSI, were convicted of bribery and fraud.
Current MSI owner William Ladd was acquitted o f those
charges, but later convicted of bank fraud and money
laundering.
James Berger, a former deputy director at the Public
Aid Department, was acquitted of corruption charges.

Agreement pumps millions into Illinois River watershed
PEORIA, 111. (AP) — Top
government leaders from both
parties signed a $450-m illion
agreement on Monday to protect
the
Illinois
River
from
sedimentation and pollutants.
“The econom y and the
environment can work together.
The two must go hand in hand if
we are to have a sustainable
future,”
U.S.
A griculture

Secretary Dan Glickman told a
standing-room-only audience in
the Gateway Building on Peoria’s
riverfront.
The USDA will spend up to
$350 million on the program,
matched by nearly $100 million
from Illinois.
The funds will pay farmers to
take
erodible
and
environmentally sensitive land

out of production for up to 15
years or longer. The voluntary
program may affect up to
232,000 acres by 2002.
“This is a celebration of the art
of the possible,” U.S. Sen. Carol
Mosley-Braun told the audience.
“Everybody came together to
make certain this issue became
reality.”
“This has cut across party and

jurisdictional lines,” U.S. Sen.
Dick Durbin said.
He said the goals o f the plan
include reducing sediment going
into the waterway by 20 percent,
cutting back on nitrogen and
phosphorus from farm chemicals
by
10 percent,
increasing
populations of waterfow l and

shorebirds by 15 percent and
boosting native fish and mussel
stocks by 10 percent.
“W e’re putting our m oney
where our rhetoric has been, said
Gov. Jim Edgar. “A half-billion
dollars in 15 years, this is
meaningful.”

Gore announces improvements to
civilian Global Positioning System
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Global
Positioning
System,
which provides pinpoint location
information around the world to
the U.S. military, will soon
provide the same accurate data to
civilians thanks to an upgrade
announced by Vice President A1
Gore.
He said M onday that the
governm ent will expand the
number of signals available for
civilian use from one to three.
That
should
overcom e
atm ospheric
distortion
that
affects the current lone civilian
signal by providing companion
channels to check for accuracy.
The announcement builds on
another one made in 1996, when
the Clinton administration said
that over the course of the next
decade, it would eliminate small
errors intentionally inserted into
GPS to guard against its misuse
by non-Pentagon users.
Taken together, the changes
mean that by the middle of the
next decade, hand-held GPS
receivers sold to civilians should
soon be able to pinpoint locations
within 33 feet - 10 times as close
as the current range of 325 feet.
The hand-held units are
already used by outdoorsmen and
are beginning to be featured in

new and rental automobiles for
use in emergencies or to provide
directions to lost drivers.
“GPS has become an engine
o f economic
growth
and
efficiency as businesses and
consum ers
are
continually
developing new and creative
applications of the system,” Gore
said in a statement. “We will
continue to do everything we can
to protect these GPS signals and
promote GPS applications for
commercial, public safety and
national security interests.”
The Pentagon spent dlrs 10
billion developing the Global
Positioning System, which works
off information from 24 satellites
positioned around the Earth.
Those
satellites
transm it
signals giving the satellite’s
location and the tim e o f the
transm ission. A GPS receiver
uses that data to calculate the
satellite’s relative position, and,
consequently, the receiv er’s
position.
The military inserted errors in
the current system’s timing signal
to protect its troops. The
receivers they use filter out the
errors, a process called “selective
availability.” Both Gore and
President Clinton announced in
1996 that they wanted to make

GPS information more accessible
to the public and private
enterprise, in part by eliminating
selective availability by 2006.
The new system would
provide the same protection for
the m ilitary by elim inating
service for entire regions in times
of war.
W hile the military currently
has use of two GPS signals,
civilians can receive only one.
The second signal, which Gore
said would be operational by
2005, may be most useful in the
public safety arena because of its
improved accuracy.
The third civil signal, whose
operational date has not yet been
determined, will primarily be of
use to scientific users and
surveyors, because a total of
three GPS signals would allow
for even better accuracy than one
or two signals, the vice president
said.
The changes will take some
time to implement because they
will require new satellites and
new receivers. The satellites are
routinely changed every 7 1/2
years. Existing GPS receivers
will still work with the new
system, although they will not
provide the improved accuracy.

Families reach settlement with amusement park
TULSA, Okla. (AP) _ An out-of-court settlement has
been reached in connection with last year’s fatal roller
coaster accident at a local amusement park.
The dollar amount of M onday’s settlement with Bell’s
Amusement Park was not disclosed, although the attorney
for three of the claim aints said it was fair.
“My clients didn’t want to go through a civil trial,”
attorney Clark B rew ster said. “This was the best
resolution for everyone involved.”
The claims stem m ed from the Apiil 20 accident in
which 14-year-old Patrick Kurek of Tulsa was killed.
The claimants included his family and the boy’s
friends, Ryan Denton and Dionte Parker, who were with
him when their ride car slid backward down the incline

and into another car.
Johnny Fagin, his two daughters and a friend’s 3-yearold girl, who were riding in the car and received minor
injuries, were also claimants, as were two people who
were not directly involved in the accident.
“Somebody asked me today whether I was happy about
it. I’m not,” said Kurek’s mother, Jane Kurek. ‘T here’s
just a sense of relief that it’s behind us.”
After a lengthy study, a state Labor Department report
said a plastic device designed to prevent the Wildcat roller
coaster car from sliding backward was faulty. The
Wildcat’s manufacturer recommended a different type of
plastic be used in the device than what Bell’s had
installed.

Brewster said his clients were willing to resolve their
claims in part because they had a good understanding of
what caused the accident and because the park had
worked to correct the problem.
The attorney for Bell’s said park officials “deeply
regret” the accident but that they hope the settlement will
help put it behind them.
“The Bell family is relieved that this m atter is
concluded and that they can get back to serving this
community, as they have for a number of years,” Robert
Coffey said.
The Tulsa County D istrict A ttorney’s Office is
investigating whether park officials should face criminal
charges as a result o f the accident.

Fewer students could mean small-school closures
CASPER, W yo. (AP) —
N atrona
C ounty’s
student
population is dropping, and
C asper’s smallest schools will
have to offer attractive programs
if they want to stay open, school
district officials said.
Staff members recommended
that the district take up to two
years to talk with teachers, staff
and parents from the small
schools about what to do about
declining enrollment.
The problem comes at a time

when district officials are also
trying to determine how best to
use additional state funding due
to the district under a new
education finance system.
Under the system approved by
the Legislature this year, the
Casper School District could get
up to $9.5 million more next year
than it received from the state this
year.
The population of C asper’s
schools is falling steadily at a rate
of about 200 students per year

and is now about 12,000 students.
The new state education
finance formula provides districts
with about $6,000 per student. A
loss of 200 students translates to
a loss of about $1.2 million in
state funding.
Statewide student enrollment
has been dropping for several
years also, several lawmakers
said during this year’s session.
Superintendent Stan Olson
said in Natrona County, local
birth rates appear to show the

trend will continue.
“It’s not a disastrous pattern,”
he said. “It is a pattern w e’ve got
to recognize and be smart
about.”
Of the district’s 31 elementary
schools, seven have only one
classroom per grade.
Those schools are still viable,
said Chuck Huber, a district
personnel official. But he said
they will have to make sure that
parents
and
other district
residents know that.

“It has to be a product people
want to come to,” he said.
Members of the school board
have indicated they know they
would be in for a political fight if
they ever decide to propose
closing a school.
Chairm an Jack Wold and
Olson recently visited one of the
seven small schools for what they
thought would be a staff meeting,
but 65 people showed up.
“They were very defensive of
that school, very proud of that
school,” Wold said.

Air Force releases results of US - German crash off Nambia
M CGUIRE AIR
FORCE
BASE, N.J. (AP) - A German
military aircraft was flying at the
wrong altitude when it collided
with a U.S. transport plane off the
coast o f Africa, killing 33 people,
an A ir Force investigation
concluded.
The Air Force C-141 and the
German Tupolev 154 were each
traveling at about 500 miles per
hour and struck nearly head-on
about 150 miles off Namibia last
September, officials said today.
Both planes were traveling at
an altitude of 35,000 feet, the
investigation board reported.
That was the proper altitude for
the C-141, but the T upolev’s
flight plan called for it to cruise at
39.000 feet.
Under international aviation
rules, the German plane should
have been at either 33,000 or
37.000 feet because o f its
direction o f travel, said Col.
William H. C. Schell Jr., vice
commander of the Air Force’s
375th Airlift Wing, who headed
the investigation board.
A lthough the planes flew
almost directly at each other, the
crews apparently had no warning
of the impending collision, Schell
said.
“ It’s very difficult to see

another aircraft out in front of
you that’s at the same altitude,”
he said.
Schell said the German crew,
and air traffic controllers in
Angola, should have realized it
was not at the proper altitude.
The nine people aboard the C141 and the 24 on the Tupolev
were killed.
Poor air traffic control and
poor ground communications in
the region contributed to the
accident, the board concluded.
The German plane had filed a
flight plan in Angola, but air
controllers there did not properly
track the aircraft. And because of
communications problems, the
flight plan did not reach the
agency in Windhoek, Namibia,
that controlled the air space
where the crash occurred.
The American aircraft had
filed proper flight plans and
followed them, the Air Force
said.
Windhoek
controllers
followed proper procedures and,
based on the information they
had, could not have known that
the German plane was heading
for the American plane.
The C-141 was returning to
McGuire, about 15 miles south of
Trenton, N.J., after delivering
troops and 32,000 pounds of

not a player as far as an accident
cause,” Schell said.
“It would have been another
piece of safety equipment on the
aircraft and could have helped,”
Schell added. “We can only
speculate as to whether it could
have prevented this accident.”
Earlier this month, Gen.
Walter Kross, the head of the
U.S. Transportation Command,
said: “My personal opinion is that
if the C-141 had TCAS on it, we
probably would have avoided
that crash.”
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary
William
Cohen
announced
Monday that the Air Force was
moving to put more anti-collision
devices on many of its aircraft.
“I think it’s something that
needs to be done as soon as it is
technically feasible to do. And we
have requested the Air Force to
move as quickly as they can, and
we believe the Air Force has a
program in place that will
accomplish that,” Cohen said at
the Pentagon.
Kenneth Bacon, the Defense
Department spokesman, said the
Air Force plans to increase
spending from $600 million to
$1.6 billion on installing the
TCAS, along with a number of
other safety devices.

antipersonnel
m ine-clearing
equipment to Namibia. It w'as the
first McGuire-based aircraft lost
since 1976 when two cargo
planes crashed on the same day in
separate incidents in Europe.
The Soviet-made German air
force plane was en route from
Germany to Cape Town, South
Africa, where soldiers were to
have participated in a boat race
marking the 75th anniversary of
the South African navy.
Senior Pentagon officials in
Washington, who spoke on
condition o f anonymity, said
Monday that the crash may have
been prevented" had adequate
anti-collision devices been in use.
The Air Force is moving to speed
up installation of such devices on
many of its aircraft.
The collision alert system,
called TCAS, is required on
commercial U.S. aircraft. It alerts
pilots to nearby aircraft and tells
them what protective action to
take. Neither m ilitary plane
involved in the collision had such
a system.
But
Schell
said
that
was
not
considered
by
the
investigation
board.
Because such a device was not
required
to
be
in
the
aircraft, “therefore
it was

Cohen, asked w hether the
service had been dragging its feet
on installing the devices, noted
that the Air Force has been barred
by law from making such updates
to aircraft due to be retired within
five years.
He said, however, that waivers
to the law might be sought and
that the collision-avoidance
devices need to be installed on
existing aircraft “as soon as
possible. The other modification
on existing aircraft needs to be
done as soon as technically
feasible as w ell.”
The
number
of
C-141
transports carrying the system
will rise from 60 to 90, and
overall the service plans to have
the system in some 2,500 aircraft
by the year 2008, Bacon said. At
present, only 300 of the service’s
aircraft have the system.
This week a set of about two
dozen bones will be buried at
Arlington National Cemetery in
the name o f seven o f the
crewmen aboard the C-141.

A sketch b ij J im

M a h fo o d h im s e lf
is p ic tu re d ,
h o ld in q the
p e n cil.

Jim M ahfood got his start in
the comic book business by selfpublishing
books
like
“Girlscouts.” Now, he is doing
work for som e o f the bigger
distributors, like Marvel and Oni
Press, but his gritty, underground
style h asn’t changed a bit.
Mahfood’s work can be seen in
the comic book continuation of
Kevin Sm ith’s “Clerks”, which
Smith
w rote,
or
in
the
“G eneration-X
Underground
Special” for Marvel.

Art, along with m usic are
probably the m ost important
things in my life. It comes
from my attitudes and what I
like. Most o f the things I write
and draw are taken from my life,
and the lives of those closest to
me, my friends. ...It’s a very
heavy thing.

W hat kind of direction did
Kevin Smith give you for the
"Clerks" comic?

That would probably be either
Spiderm an or dinosaurs, like
when I was still a little, little kid.
I’ve been draw ing ever since I
was a little kid.

When I first started the gig, I
had to do character sketches of all
the characters. So, before I
started the job I had to meet
K evin’s and View A skew ’s
approval. From there, Kevin sent
me the w hole script and I
did rough pencil layouts of the
whole book.

How do you describe your
attitude tow ards art?

MAHFOOD, page 11

W hat's the first thing that
you ever rem em ber drawing?

When words like homophobia
or homosexual are mentioned,
some people don’t want to talk
about it, some leave the room and
some like to get it out in the open.
M otivational speaker Paul
W esselmann
gave
three
seminars yesterday on the topics
o f hom ophobia and sexual
orientation. W esselmann, the
creator o f the “Stone Soup
Sem inars,” gives talks all
over the United States about
self-em pow erm ent, leadership,
com m unication,
and
team
building.
“Our goal here is not to
change anybody’s mind about
gay, lesbian or bisexual topics,”
Wesselmann said, “the goal is too
get everyone to b e open and talk
about
their
opinions
and
questions.”
The Hickory/Hackberry Room
in the University Center was the
site of three sessions in the oneday series of seminars. The first
two seminars explored the topic
o f hom ophobia and the third
discussed sexual orientation and
coming out.
The seminars offered a safe
environm ent for topics to be
discussed that aren’t always easy
to discuss. Wesselmann also

requested that the topics
discussed come from the
questions o f the audience.
“I am interested more in what
the group wants to know other
than simply me telling them
what I know,” Wesselmann said,
“but the discussion needs to
keep a balance of questions and
given information to help with
education. I learn from them
like they learn from me.”
Wesselmann thinks that the
important discussion needs to
go on outside o f the seminar.
“It’s really a topic of
understanding,”
W esselmann
said. “If the discussion of sexual
orientation continues outside of
this room in offices and
classroom s,
then
more
understanding can be achieved.”
Topics from teaching children
about sexual orientation to
religion were tackled and
W esselm ann’s
answer
was
simple
in
each
area;
understanding and love.
“We can teach children about
sexual orientation,” Wesselmann
said. “There are age-appropriate
methods
of
explaining
homosexuality to children.”
Sophomore Nick Hughes from
Chicago, 111. thinks the seminar
was informative and educational.
“I think it is a positive thing to
openly discuss homophobia and
sexual orientation,” Hughes said.

Motivational speaker
Kenneth Wesselmann
“You could get to know more
about yourself and others that
way.”
Kris Tucker-Lowe, Housing
Coordinator at Cougar Village,
played a big part in organizing
the sem inars and feels it’s
important to go a step further in
understanding gay, lesbian and
bisexual issues.
“At SIUE we love pathways to
harm ony,” Tucker-Lowe said.
“We are a good communications
outlet on such issues for people
other than college students.”
Tucker-Lowe also thinks that
any
open
exploration
of
homosexual issues is healthy for
the campus community.
“SIUE needs to present a
united front to say we celebrate
and appreciate people o f all
orientations and life itself,”
Tucker-Lowe said.

Actually, we would only speak
every couple of weeks. He saw
the first half of the book and dug
it, and it wasn’t until the book
was completely done with that I
heard back from them again ... It
wasn’t like he was calling me
every day, saying, “W here’s
those pages? This looks like
sh*t.” I think we both met at a
point where it was a pretty good
marriage of the art and the story.
Were you very familiar with
the film before you did this?
I’ve been a follower and fan of
his work, that’s why it. was such
an honor to be able to work with
him on my first 32-page big
comic. What more could you
ask for?
How long does it take you to
churn out a page?
I’m doing usually a page a day
right now.
What kind of frame o f mine
do you have to be in to do
successful work?
I really have to be focused. I
really have to be in the frame of
mine to work on the finished
comic book page. Because when
I approach the page like just
drawing in my sketch book,
doodling for me, it’s a totally
different approach. W hen I ’m
working on a page I feel like I’m
almost performing. I feel like I’m
on-stage. Because, that’s the stuff
that people are gonna see
Do you see the com ics
business as a competitive type
thing,
or
is
there
a
camaraderie?

Page 1 1

I think there’s a camaraderie
between the people that put out
good quality stuff. I think the
competition comes from, I’m not
going to name names or
anything, but from the bigger
companies that are really,
really concerned about selling
more swimsuit issues and
crossovers, so they can make
their billion dollars.
Do you have plans for doing
anything
with
your
"Girlscouts" characters?
Right now, that’s on hiatus,
but I want to bring them back for
something. The only problem is
the name, and figuring out how I
can use it legally. Because when I
was in Kansas City, the Girl
Scouts did approach me with a
lawsuit saying that if I continued
to use the name they would
pursue legal action. I can’t take
on the Girl Scouts of America,
come on.
Well, you could, but you'd
probably lose.
I’d probably lose miserably.
Do you have any statement
you're trying to make with
your work?
No, the thing is, for a while I
was like, “God, I’ve got to really
use my talent to spread
knowledge and educate.” And I
think that’s well and good, and
it’s nice to have a message in
your stuff, but right now, I’m just
trying to tell good stories with
some really nice visuals that
people can get into. I think the
majority of my stuff is catered
towards people my age. 16-yearolds on up. It’s mature stuff. I’m
not catering my stuff towards the
super-hero genre.

Amanda Manvel
Fr., science

“This girl I saw with a
moustache thicker than

What do you miss about the
world o f self-publishing?
Not as much pressure. It’s up
to me to produce the work. It was
up to me to get it out there. If I
wanted to spend three days on a
really cool page, I could...Besides
that, there’s not really all that
much I miss. I really enjoy letting
the publishers w orry about
advertising, distribution, printing.
Those things were all just like
thorns in my side.
What are you working on

lives in this town called Freak
City, a weird place where all this
stuff happens. He’s basically like
the tow n’s protector.
What does he eat instead
of brains?
Just
norm al
food,
vegetarian stuff.
What exactly makes him a
zombie?
He was a normal person, but I
haven’t gone into his origin yet,
but I ’ll give you a brief
description. W hen he was like
eight or nine, he got bitten by a
zombie. Something went wrong
in the transformation, and he was
still conscious of who he was and
it left him with supernatural
power. It didn’t turn him into a
stereotypical mindless zombie.

SIUE softball looking for consistent play, leadership over weekend
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
The SIUE softball team will
look for consistent play and
leadership this weekend in Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference
competition.
Bellarmine
C ollege,
the
University o f Southern Indiana
and Kentucky Wesleyan College
will join SIUE in St. Louis this
weekend as the Cougars hope to
move up from fourth place in the

Southwest Division of the GLVC.
“This year, the conference is
wide open,” head coach Sandy

team that is really dominating.
Whoever comes prepared to play
is going to win the game.”
The Cougars, who hold a
record of 16-15, are led
offensively by junior Sarah
Sollberger of Peoria. Sollberger
is batting .429 with seven home
runs and 35 RBIs on the season.
She also leads the squad in

doubles, with 15, and has swiped
13 bases.
Senior
outfielder
Gwen
Jackson, of Collinsville, is
second on the team in hits with
35 and.is tied for the team lead in
triples. Jackson also leads the
team with 14 stolen bases.
Bridgeton,

Kim
Messinger is second among the
Cougars with a .393 batting
average. She has 33 hits and 13
RBIs on the year.

Six ISU football players
charged in frat fight
NORMAL, 111. (AP) — Six
Illinois State University football
players have now been charged
in a fraternity house fight that
injured at least six people.
Robert Boyd, 19, Aveion
Cason, 18, and Christopher
Marks, 18, were charged Friday
with felony home invasion and
mob action.
Felony home invasion charges
were filed earlier this week
against Jason Leach, 20, who
was charged with home invasion;
Kenneth Ramsey, 22, who was
also charged with mob action;
and Leonard Reliford, 19, who
was
also
charged
with
aggravated battery.
Police say about 25 football
players armed with homemade
weapons converged on the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house on Sunday
night.
The attack followed a fight at
the fraternity Saturday, Normal

police Lt. Tony Daniels said.
Witnesses said some of the
players involved in the fight used
pipes, broken broom handles and
a tent stake wrapped in tape in
the attack.
All six players are due in court
April
17
and
have
been suspended from
the
team indefinitely. Two others
were suspended when they
were
arrested
then
were
reinstated after being released
without charges.
A witness told The Pantagraph
newspaper in Bloomington the
fight began when a football
player caught urinating in a
shower refused to leave the
house.
Alumni of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon have hired an off-duty
Normal police officer to keep
watch
over
the
building
during evenings.

Smith has a record of 5-7.
Jessica
Silbe,
of
Pinckneyville, also has five wins
to her name so far this year. She
is second on the team with 19
strikeouts in 56 innings pitched.
Sophomore Sara Obrecht has
an ERA of 2.84 and a record of 31 while senior Stephanie Stinson
has the second best ERA on the
team at 2.55.
The Cougars start off the
weekend road trip on Saturday
at 8 a.m.

Six injured, four arrested during hoops celebration
LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) —
Camped out in front of Rupp
Arena five hours before the
national champion Kentucky
Wildcats were to arrive for a
pep rally, 10-year-old Justin
Puffer got a lesson in supply
and demand.
Tickets
for
the
event
commemorating Kentucky’s 7869 title game victory over Utah
were gone within minutes after
the sales window
opened
Tuesday morning.
The 20,000 fans fortunate
enough to get tickets somehow
found a way to scream louder as
the pep rally progressed, even
with strained vocal chords. At
7:06 p.m. EST, the team bus
drove to the edge of the Rupp
Arena floor, and out jumped the
national

champions

‘Comeback

C ats’ as

the
several

posters proclaimed.
Although the crowd erupted
with deafening hysteria after
the

announcement

of

each

team member, the loudest cheers
of

all

were

for

first-year

coach Tubby Smith.
“The love affair you all have
for Kentucky basketball and this
program is unbelievable, and it’s
second to none,” Smith told the
fans, his next sentence being
drowned out by crowd noise.
Senior Cameron Mills gave
credit to former coach Rick
Pitino, who left the team at the
end of last season to accept a
head coaching job with the
Boston Celtics. But M ills’
highest praise was for Smith.
“ I don’t think y o u ’ll ever
know how much our relationship
means to m e,” said Mills, before
giving his coach a hug.
Tournament Most Outstanding
Player Jeff Sheppard seemed to
choke up as he spoke about the
influence of his teammates. And
Kentucky’s other senior, Allen
Edwards, thanked the fans for
supporting him follow ing the
death of his mother during the
tournament.
At the end of the hoopla, the
players raised the championship
banner to the rafters, posing in

front of the cameras almost as if
they had done all this before.
At Keeneland, across from
Blue Grass Airport where the
team landed Tuesday night, an
estim ated 800 to 1,000 fans
showed up, many because they
couldn’t get tickets to the
celebration in Rupp Arena.
The players went out in the
crowd and signed shirts and
newspapers, w hile Smith was
presented with a cake that read:
“Tubby takes the cake.”
With two seasons of practice
in controlling wild crowds after
national title games, Lexington
police were ready to handle the
mob of near 1 5 OOfl fans who
celebrated in the streets. Three
hundred officers lined downtown
Lexington in full riot gear,
watching the chaos with the aid
o f spotlights from a National
Guard helicopter.
Police made ten arrests during
the
celebration,
and
the
University of Kentucky hospital
reported that 25 people had been
treated for minor injuries.

Rick Majerus remembers when Kentucky played in ‘66
SAN ANTONIO (AP) — The
last tim e U tah was in the
Final Four, Rick M ajerus was 18
years old and ju st beginning to
form ideas about basketball. The
1966
NCAA
tournam ent
com m anded his attention and
made a lasting impact.
That was the year Texas
Western (now Texas-El Paso)
had the audacity to start five
black players against five whites
and
won
a
national
championship. The coach was
Don H askins, w ho thought
nothing about the sociological
revolution he was launching
during racially tense times.
David Lattin, Bobby Joe Hill,
Willie Worsley, Orsten Artis and
Harry Flournoy started that game
and Nevil Shed and Willie Cager

cam e off the bench, and
together they changed basketball
for good.
Haskins insisted he was not
making
any
civil
rights
statement. He was just trying to
win a basketball game and using
the best players he had.
That made em inently good
sense to M ajerus. And so
did Texas W estern’s dedication
to defense.
"It was the first championship
game I w atched,” he said as Utah
prepared for M onday n ig h t’s
championship game which it lost
78-69 to Kentucky. “I was still
young. I rem em ber George
Ireland winning with Chicago
Loyola and Tom Thacker
winning two at Cincinnati. But
that was the first time I had any

idea about the gam e.”
And Texas Western gave him
plenty o f ideas.
“I enjoyed watching them ,”
Majerus said. “I liked the way
they played. I liked their defense.
I didn’t know a lot about it.
But I saw defense as something
I could do. I gravitated
toward that.”
Texas W estern’s first step to
the championship came against a
Utah team
led by Jerry
Chambers. The Utes had lost
their captain, G eorge Fisher,
with a broken leg late in the
season. That shifted the burden
to Chambers and he responded,
leading Utah to the West Region
cham pionship. The U tes beat
Pacific 83-74 as Cham bers
scored 40 points, and Oregon

State 70-64. Cham bers, Rich
Tate and M erv Jackson were
named to the All-Region team.
Next came the Final Four and
the Utes ran into Texas Western,
losing 85-78. Teams played a
third-place game then and Duke
edged the Utes 79-77. Even with
the two losses, U tah’s Chambers
still was voted the M VP of
the tournament.
It was a landmark Final Four,
not only for Haskins but also for
Utah. The Utes have been back
in the tournam ent frequently,
including six times in the last
nine years, but never in 32 years
had they been back to the
Final Four.
Majerus, meanwhile, got into
coaching, first as an assistant to
A1
M cG uire
and
Hank

Raymonds at M arquette, later
as an assistant to Don Nelson
with the NBA M ilwaukee Bucks
and as a head coach, first
at Marquette, then at Ball State
and, for the last nine years,
at Utah.
He
cultivated
numerous
friendships in the profession,
including an important one at
Texas-El Paso. They’re friendly
rivals in the WAC and Haskins
was delighted when M ajerus
reached the Final Four.
“One of the nicest notes I got
was from him ,” Majerus said.
“He sent me a fruit basket.
I think Don ate half the fruit.
Then he was concerned that I got
it. I hadn’t gotten it when we
talked and he was upset with
his secretary."

Ex-Rutgers basketball player
Indians place Dwight Gooden on disabled list
CLEVELAND (AP) — The the acquisition o f Dave Burba training, but pitched well in his
gets fine, probation in sex case
NEW BRU N SW ICK , N.J.
(AP) — A form er Rutgers
University basketball player has
been fined and placed on three
years’ probation for sneaking
into dorm itory room s and
fondling w om en’s feet while
they slept.
M aurice B row n, 20, was
sentenced M onday for one count
of criminal sexual contact and
two counts o f burglary. Superior
Court Judge Phillip Lewis Paley
ordered Brow n to continue
mental health counseling, fined
him $4,465 and ordered .him
not to have any contact with
the women.
Brown avoided a jail sentence

by pleading guilty to the charges
Feb. 5. In return, prosecutors
dropped all other charges relating
to the eight incidents in which
Brown walked into unlocked
rooms of female students and
fondled their feet.
In at least one incident, he
allegedly rubbed a student’s feet
with his penis, authorities said.
Brown, a freshman forward
from Syracuse, N.Y., withdrew
from school Dec. 9, following his
arrest after a com plaint by a
female student.
U niversity
officials
said
Brown never appeared in a game
for Rutgers, either regular season
or exhibition.

Cleveland Indians have so many
ailing pitchers that even the
D octor
cam e
down
with
something.
Dwight Gooden, expected to
be Cleveland’s fourth starter after

from Cincinnati, was placed
on the 15-day disabled list
Monday with stiffness in his
right shoulder.
Gooden was rained out twice
in the final week o f spring

final start. W hile the Indians
traveled to Seattle for Tuesday’s
opener against the M ariners,
Gooden stayed in Winter Haven,
Fla., to pitch in a minor
league game.

Dismantled Marlins open season against revamped Cubs
M IAM I (AP) — F or Jim
Leyland, this y e a r’s Florida
Marlins will not be about wins
and losses.
After dism antling the World
Series championship team in the
offseason to cut in h alf its
payroll, the M arlins are left with
14 rookies on their 25-m an
roster. A nd a heavy dose o f
uncertainty as they open the
season today against Chicago.
“I’m ready to roll,” Leyland
said Monday. “I d o n ’t know
where the hell it’s going, but
I’m going.”
While the fans will m easure
success in the num ber of
victories, Leyland said he w on’t
do that.
Instead, it will be the more
intangible

m easure

of

improvement — part proven by
statistics, part only visible to a

m anager with 35 years in
baseball.
“That’s going to be the test of
this team, to get better as we go
along,” Leyland said.
Still, the Cubs are taking no
chances. The W orld Series
banner will be unfurled at Pro
Player Stadium before the game,
a reminder not to be caught off­
guard by the little-known names
in the lineup.
“They’re the defending world
champions, and w e’re going to
treat them like that,” said Cubs
veteran first basem an M ark
Grace, who broke his right toe
Sunday with a foul ball and will
not start today.
W orld Series M VP Livan
Hernandez will face Cubs starter
Kevin Tapani. Both finished last
season 9-3.
Tapani said M onday he
prepared no different for the

opener than he would have for a
more experienced M arlins club.
“That really doesn’t m atter,”
he said. “I guess the only thing
different is you m ight have
faced a guy 50-60 tim es.
(Today) you m ight w ind up
getting surprised.”
A torn right rotator cuff on
M arlins’ ace Alex Fernandez has
left Hernandez, with less than
a full year in the majors, the
m ost veteran pitcher in the
starting rotation. He is joined by
four rookies.
“I ’m
definitely
not
a
veteran,” said the 23-year-old
right-hander. “The ace pitcher of
the staff is Alex Fernandez. It’s
fallen on me (to start), and I’m
happy to do it.”
The Cubs also underwent an
offseason overhaul, the fruits of
which should be shown Tuesday.
Chicago added six veterans in

hopes of avoiding a repeat of
last year’s 0-14 start.
“I feel confident. I like our
ballclub,”
m anager
Jim
Riggleman said, then paused. “I
felt confident last year.”
The Cubs, who haven’t won a
World Series title since 1908
and haven’t been to one since
1945,
signed
free
agent
shortstop Jeff B lauser from
Atlanta and closer Rod Beck
from the Giants. Through trades,
they picked up second baseman
M ickey M orandini from the
Phillies and left fielder Henry
Rodriguez from the Expos.
They also got center fielder
Lance Johnson and right-hander
M ark Clark, who jo in ed the
team last August in a trade with
the Mets.
Absent from today’s lineup
will be Grace, a career .310
hitter who fouled a ball off his

right big toe Sunday in his last
at-bat of spring. He will be
replaced by Brant Brown.
First base also was a question
for the Marlins until Monday,
when Leyland nam ed rookie
Ryan Jackson as the starter over
rookie Derrek Lee, who was
acquired in a trade fo r ace
Kevin Brown. Veteran Jim
Eisenreich, another option at
first, said M onday he would
miss opening day because o f a
death in the family.
Jackson said he was excited
to m eet G race, one o f his
favorite players. But he did not
want to dwell on it.
“T h at’s ju st one o f those
things you don’t like to think
about when yo u ’re out on
the field,” Jackson said. “You
could be intimidated by some of
those guys.”

Judge dismissed a drunken driving charge against Buffalo Bills’ Smith
VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP)
A judge dism issed a drunken

Smith refused to take a bloodalcohol test.

charges during a Sept. 2 trial in
General District Court.
Lowe said prosecutors failed
to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that Smith was intoxicated
when officer Alison Fletcher
found him sitting behind the

wheel of his Mercedes Benz.
Lowe noted that Smith did
“fairly w ell” on two field

Smith said he passed out
because he suffers from sleep
