Board of trustees Homecoming 2000
ready for meeting
BY ANDY LEHMAN
ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR
Gov.
George
Ryan’s
proposed $12.6 million increase
in general revenue funds for the
2001 operating budget will be
one topic of discussion at the SIU
board of trustees meeting
Thursday.
"The governor’s budget
provides a very strong level of
funding for SIU,” interim SIU
President Frank E. Horton said.
“We look forward to making our
case to the Legislature in the next
step of the budget process.”
Ryan’s proposed budget
includes a 5-percent salary
increase for faculty and staff, a
library cost increase, funds for
improvements to SIU buildings
and infrastructure, and a $1.6
million initiative to improve the
SIU School of Medicine.
SIUE and the School of
Dental Medicine fared well in
Ryan’s proposal. If the budget is

passed by the Illinois Legislature,
SIUE will receive an increase in
salaries, funds for operation and
maintenance of the engineering
building, funds to enhance the
dental school in Alton and
$50,000 to begin a bachelor’s
degree program in manufacturing
engineering.
There will also be a
discussion of the effects of Y2K
on the SIU campuses.
“There were only minor
glitches,” Horton said. “It was a
big scare for nothing.”
Other issues include a report
from the Architecture and Design
Committee, committee updates
and a report on the search for a
new SIU president.
“We are taking applications
until the day of appointment,”
Horton said. “This way we can
find the best candidate for the
position.”
The SIU board of trustees
meeiting will be at SIU
Carbondale.

Finance board gets tough
Members look into money allocations
BY BRIAN WALLHEIMER
NEWS REPORTER
Members of the student
finance board will be taking a
closer
look
at
student
organizations’ requests
for
money.
Every year, organizations
request money from student
government to pay for expenses
such as postage fees, copying
and printing. The finance board
decides
how
much
an
organization can receive based
on its activity, needs and amount
used in the past year.
At the board’s meeting
Friday, Finance Board Chair Phil
Gersman said that he wants to
make sure organizations are not
getting too much money.
He plans to go through every
application with the finance

board to allocate the money. He
said he wants to save money that
could be used in student
programs.
The finance board sent three
travel requests and a program
request to the senate for
approval.
The board approved $425
for the SIUE Constructors to go
to the American Concrete
Institute, $425. to the Newman
Student Union for the Global
Solidarity/Haiti
Connection
annual trip, $413 to Sigma
Gamma Rho for its 60th Central
Region Conference and $2,532
to the Indian Student Association
for India Night.
The next finance board
meeting will be 2:30 p.m. Friday,
Feb. 18, in the International
Room of the Morris University
Center.

The duo was crowned Saturday during halftime at the men’s
basketball game in the Vadalabene Center.
Lisa Ramsey, assistant director of campus life in the Kimmel
Leadership Center, said approximately 1,169 people turned out to
vote for the king and queen.
Ramsey also said approximately 100 people attended the

After 33 years, MUC may receive needed renovations
BY MAUREEN HAGRMAN
NEWS STRINGER

uumim

Since it was completed in
1967, the Morris University
Center has been a place for
students to grab a quick lunch,
meet some friends, attend a
seminar, catch a movie, bowl a
game or two, or just hang out
between classes.
The MUC is the students’

building, providing services such
as the copying and graphics
center, the bookstore, the
Kimmel Leadership Center and,
of course, Center Court, giving
them a place to hang out.
But big changes are on the
way, changes that will mean even
more service to students and
changes that will cost an
estimated $18.7 million, all of
which will come from students’

pockets. If these proposed
changes are approved, they are
expected to be completed by
spring 2003.
These changes include a
bigger food court with more
services and a stage, turning the
Opapi Lounge into a cyberspace
coffeehouse, remodeling Cougar
Den to look more like an
Applebee’s
and,
most
importantly,
infrastructure

improvements such as new
wiring for the 33-year-old
building.
According
to
Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Narbeth Emmanuel, now is the
time for these renovations. He
said the university has high
enrollment, and he wants the
university to be a home away
from home to both commuter and
residential students.

Emmanuel said he hopes the renovations will make the MUC a
center for an exciting campus life.
“We want to change the image of the UC from being another
building to develop a sense of community where students socialize
and participate,” Emmanuel said. “We want it to be the heart of social
and campus life for students.”
While the plans for many improvements are in place, university
administrators are still open to new ideas. Students are invited to a
series of meetings beginning Wednesday, Feb. 16, in Center Court.
The meetings will run from 5 to 6:30 p.m.
The renovations are still in the proposal stage. The SIU board of
trustees must approve issuing bonds to cover the costs of the
improvements. However, the SIUE Student Government Association
and the SIUE administration will vote on the project before the
trustees’ approval is sought.

Com e and enjoy this classic comedy
starring Diane Keaton & Woody Allen

■“Off the Shelf,” a cable television program
sponsored by the English department’s creative
writing committee, will feature poet Wayne Lanter
this month.
Lanter, who will read and discuss his works on
the program, is an instructor at Southwest Illinois
College and the editor of its poetry journal, “River
King.”
Rosemary Monaco, a graduate student who
teaches a class on communications and business at
SWIC, is the creator, producer and host of the show.
Monaco said every show has a guest who talks
about writing or reads passages. The guests range
from professors, teachers, librarians or writers.
Friday, the show will feature Gregory Conroy,
assistant director of public affairs at SIUE, who will

speak about the university’s online publication, the
“O.”
In the future, Monaco said she hopes to have a
show on banned books and also wants to have a
round-table discussion with members of the SIUE
faculty on changing the literary canon. She said she
wants people to read more than “just books by dead
white guys.”
According to Monaco, everyone on campus has
been very helpful in getting and keeping the show
on the air for two seasons.
“The response to the show has been good and I
have received phone calls from viewers who
enjoyed the show,” Monaco said.
The show appears on Channel 6 at 8 a.m. and 6
p.m. on Mondays and at 6 p.m. on Fridays. The

Letters to the Editor ----------- ----------— Sound-off line
Deltas understand senate’s no vote on show operational
My sole purpose in writing
this letter is to clear up any
misconceptions Alestle readers
have about Delta Sigma Theta
Sorority Inc. We are a publicservice sorority that serves the
SIUE
community
in
all
capacities. Our sorority was one
of the first black Greek letter
organizations to be chartered on
this campus in 1964.
We have sponsored clothes
drives to benefit the destitute;
penny drives to buy care products
for crack-addicted and HIVpositive babies; and along with
Habitat for Humanity, we have
helped build homes for lowincome families. Our sorority is
dedicated to improving campus
life. We provide entertainment
for the student body in the form
of poetry readings, book clubs,
fashion shows, comedy shows
and dances.
The
sorority’s
recent
problems
with
student
government over our late comedy
show program request may cause
you to question our credibility.
Therefore, I am writing to tell
you that Delta’s reason for
submitting a late request was an
honest reason. I do not need to
give
you
explicit
details
regarding our late request, since
the
memo
we
submitted
specifically to the finance board
explaining our situation was
printed in the Jan. 25 issue of the
Alestle - hats off to Alestle
reporter Brian Wallheimer.

We could have constructed
some fancy lie about our request
being late and produced some
artificial document to justify our
reason. Yet, Delta operates under
the virtue of honesty. I
understand organizations exist
that misuse and abuse the
privileges and money available
through the student government
funding process. However Delta
Sigma Theta is not one of those
organizations. Every nickel, dime
and penny we have ever made,
from events sponsored through
student activity fees, have always
gone back into the student
government account. Every piece
of advertisement we circulate
throughout the campus and
surrounding communities has
always read, “Funded in whole or
part by student activity fees.” The
only benefits we receive from
these events are the publicity for
the Delta name and furthering our
ultimate goal of serving the
public.
As
comedy
show
coordinator, I honestly felt that
SIUE’s senators would focus on
the quality of the comedy show
and how it would benefit the
campus
as
a
way
of
commemorating Black History
Month.
Nevertheless,
the
tardiness of the request overruled
the merit of the event. I commend
SIUE’s senators for their
outstanding job of enforcing
policies and procedures and
making sure student fees are

spent wisely: the senators play
hardball, cutthroat politics.
However, I must question
whether in the midst of putting
down their feet, is student
government running the danger
o f knocking down events that
will be beneficial to the campus
and student body?
Please, do not misinterpret
my argument. I am not asking
student government to bend the
rules. But, if you are going to
play strictly by the rule book,
create
an
avenue
for
organizations to travel when
things simply happen. I agree
completely that organizations
should exercise prior planning
and think strategically when
planning programs, but it is a two
way street.
On Jan. 28, the senate voted
“no cash for laughs” to Delta
Sigma Theta’s seventh Annual
Comedy Show. My Delta sisters
and I were saddened by the
results, wondering if we would
have to cancel or postpone a
traditional chapter event. Minutes
after I arrived home to think
about our loss, Phil Gersman the
finance board chair, phoned me.
With compassion in his
voice and much explanation for
his actions, he provided our
sorority with another option to
fund the program. Thus, Delta
Sigma Theta’s seventh Annual
Comedy Show will happen on

If you’ve ever wanted to
write a letter to the editor but
couldn’t find a pen and paper,
the Alestle has another option
for you.
The Alestle sound-off line
is operational and waiting for
calls.
Similar to $ound-off lines
at other newspapers, the
Alestle’s new comment line is
there 24 hours a day, seven
days a week waiting for you to
call and sound off. The number
is 841001, from any campus
phone.
All calls are anonymous,
regardless of any identification
given.
However, because calls are
anonymous,
the
Alestle
reserves the right edit all
comments.
At the end of each day all
comments will be transcribed
and printed in a new sound-off
section in the next edition of
the Alestle on the editorial
page.
So, if you don’t want to
write a letter to the editor, feel
free to call and sound off.

Feb. 26. Maybe there is hope for
student organizations’ futures in
the student government funding
process. We’ll just wait and see.

Commentary
Censorship and the Constitution collide on Clemson’s campus
(U-WIRE) CLEMSON, S.C.
- In the boldest move of
Orwellian prediction, Clemson
University’s temporary ban on
certain Internet sites assures
students that Big Brother is
indeed ever-present and at large
on our campus.
The saying, the eye of the
tiger, takes on a new meaning
after last weekend’s blockage of
Internet sites offering free long
distance via our campus Internet
connections. The eye can now be
seen as an entity that discerns
what
a
student’s
First
Amendment rights are without
regard to the student.
Sites that threatened the
university’s
on-campus
monopoly in telecommunications
were blanketed with a ban by
Clemson’s own Internet overseer.
Despite what the university
calls it, what happened last
Friday was indeed censorship.
And the quickest way to rile
students is to threaten censorship
- much less sanction it. Where
does a state-run university get the
authority to take away rights
guaranteed in the Constitution?
Since when are students excluded
from these protections of the
Constitution?
The university would be
better off if it claimed ignorance
of the banning because ignorance
was certainly involved with the
inception
of
last
week’s

blockages. The ban virtually shut
down all access to sites even
seemingly
associated
with
telephone services.
In an embarrassing debacle,
the banning of the site
http://www.funphone.com
proved humorous to Internetsavvy users. The name, and site
itself, might imply some sort of
free service, but in actuality, the
site is a sort of hoax. The site has
users fill out an intricate
application for a “service” which
the university obviously saw as
legally problematic. Yet, the
catch was instead of being able to
submit this information, the
designers of the site poignantly
pose the question whether the
user is comfortable sending such
detailed information to a
complete stranger. At the bottom
of the registration page it says,
“Would you really give all that
information to a complete
stranger over the Internet? In
return for something “free?” We
built this site for fun, and we
really don’t want your data, so we
took the “submit” button off this
page. Please be careful out
there!”
So, the university shut down
access to a page that has nothing
to do whatsoever with a phone
service, which was the intent of
the ban all along. That, dear
students, is not only utter and
blatant censorship, it’s plain

stupidity on the part of the
university for not checking its
facts.
Though Clemson may have
acted out of stupidity with the
ban
on
http://www.funphone.com,
hopefully it construed a motive
before a blanket ban was enacted.
Arguably, the incentive was a
purely self-serving move to
guarantee a monopoly of oncampus long distance calls. The
ban screams conspiracy when the
head of information technology
is
also
the
head
of
telecommunications.
Furthermore, when a memo
is sent to employees urging them
to say as little as possible about
the bans, one cannot help but
wonder. The response to the ban
before and after its publicity only
puts a shadow of doubt on the
university.
The next step for the
university would be to stop
access to online textbook
retailers
such
as
http://www.varsitybooks.com the http://www.funphone.com
ban only sets the precedent for
this.
Think about it. Clemson
operates a bookstore in which
prices are inflated and buy-backs
are worth less than a beggar’s
pittance. There are Web sites out
there that could directly interfere
with its business. The university

could argue that these sites are
not academic, but commercial.
They could cry that the loss of
revenue caused by lagging
bookstore profits would cause
tuition increases and the like,
justifying its banning of such
sites.
Once Clemson allows for
some sites to be denied access, a
dangerous precedent is set for
regulative thought throughout the
administration. As soon as one
thing is censored, who is to say
that another thing should not be
censored as well? Despite
whatever nomenclature the
administration chooses to use,
censorship did rear its ugly head
last week and Clemson may
forever be scarred by its cold
stare.

Coordinator Mary Baya said.
Baya says that this program,
combined with the free fitness
assessment offered by the
Wellness Center, will better serve
the needs of SIUE students.
Freshman Susan Baker feels
the new program will be a
success with students.
“A lot of people are
concerned with their physical

“I know I am. My eating
habits aren’t the best, and I think
if I were put on a diet or exercise

would be much more likely to eat
healthier and exercise.”

officially begin by fall of the next

Hellrung wrote.

Blues' is enjoyable, despite several structural problems
BY TOM KENNEDY
LIFESTYLES STRINGER

“Blues in the Night” came to the Katherine
Dunham Theater Feb. 3 and 4. Peformed by the
Arkansas Repertory Theater, this production was part of
SIUE’s Arts and Issues series.
Sheldon Epps, who conceived “Blues in the Night,”
should be credited with creating a theatrical anomaly,
namely, that he got the idea to have a show with four
distinct characters, but no story, plot, climax or
resolution.
Yet, somehow, this show still made for an agreeable
night. To compare this work to any serious work of
literature would be unfair. “Blues in the Night” is more
of a concert than a play.
As a concert, “Blues in the Night” was a smashing
success. Liz Mikel, who plays the lady, a slutty
Josephine Baker-type character, has the vocal power to
shake the rafters with a whisper. It is true that her
character is continually raunchy and extremely sexual she could turn any object phallic in a second - but she

also came off as classy.
Stanley White, who plays the only male
part in the show, also pulls off a powerful and
shaking performance, although he did present
a visual problem. There was an excessive
amount of makeup which dulled the
masculine features of White’s face and made
his whole appearance more feminine. This
man is supposed to be representing the sexual
power and freedom men supposedly enjoy.
Although all the characters had amazing
voices, a lot of credit has to be given to the

The Suicide Machines are back with
a new self-titled release and a new
sound which breaks
through the confines of
the punk scene

BY CONOR
BEZANE
IOWA STATE
DAILY
(U -W IR E )
AMES, Iowa — Major players in the
Midwest punk scene for nearly a decade, The
Suicide Machines have played everywhere
from friends’ basements to church auditoriums
and run-down bowling alleys.
The band’s do-it-yourself ethic has
remained strong through the years, but on the
new self-titled album, the guys lose some of
their punk rebelliousness.
It’s not necessarily a bad thing, though.
If a band puts out the same album three
times in a row, the idea gets stale, and that’s
something this Detroit quartet has obviously
learned.
Out of nowhere in 1996, The Suicide
Machines inked a deal with major label
Hollywood Records, releasing the nearflawless punk milestone “Destruction By
Definition.”
Formerly known as Jack Kevorkian and
the Suicide Machines, the band was forced to
change its name when it scored that record
deal.
Four years later, The Suicide Machines
serve up alternative pop music, brought to you
from a band whose punk roots are concealed
more and more with each album.
On “The Suicide Machines,” hitting stores
Feb. 15, there’s only a handful of punk and ska
songs to choose from.
Drenched in vocal harmonies and pop
hooks, “Sometimes I Don’t Mind” is destined
to be a hit on alternative radio, and it even
packs enough bubble, gum to possibly make it
onto MTV’s “Total Request Live.” That is if
MTV opens up its mind a little more.
In essence, it’s a love song about a guy
and his dog, a clever concept that works
perfectly.
“Well
you’re
always on my
m i n d /
Every
day is
like
t h e
first

day/ And I
talk to you
sometimes even
though you don’t
talk back/ And I buy
you things sometimes ’cause
I don’t mind,” the song says.
Ironically, the new style is less formulaic
than the dry, methodical sound of the masses
of “non-conformist” late ’90s punk bands.
While it does have a more produced,
clean-cut feel to it than past Suicide Machines
efforts, punkers shouldn’t be turned off.
“The Suicide Machines” is a perfectly
valid musical expression, despite the fact that
most of it doesn’t fall under the category of
what many would call “punk” music.
The signature pop-punk of “All Out” and
“Green” (two of the few “punk” selections)
sharply contrast with “The Fade Away,” which
incorporates violin music in the instrumental
break.
“I Never Promised You a Rose Garden”
takes the strings idea and runs wild, layering
violin sounds under a ska backbeat.
“Goodbye For Now” has the same energy
as an Irish drinking song, making it one of the
album’s high points.
The hard-core punk of “Reasons” brings
to mind the same feeling of the band’s cover of
hard-core band Minor Threat’s “I Don’t Wanna
Hear It.”
“I Hate Everything,” with it’s chorus of —
surprise — “F— you/I hate everything,”
sharply juxtaposes “Extraordinary,” an
easygoing song that features an instrumental
break of strings and horns thrown into the
arrangement.
It’s not that The Suicide Machines is
doing anything particularly innovative. Short,
punchy songs with a high-spirited feel are its
established style, and the band stands out
among the masses because of how tightly and
cleanly it does it.

Lady Cougars roll past St. Joseph’s
Gladson knocks down career-high 18 points; SIUE moves into tie fo r second place in conference
BY TONY AMMANN
SPORTS EDITOR
The Lady Cougars faced off
with St. Joseph’s College
Saturday at the Vadalabene
Center with the mission of taking
sole possession of second place in
the
Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference.
However, the anticipated
matchup of St. Joseph’s Angie
Hupfer vs. SIUE’s Misi Clark
threatened to take precedence
over the Lady Pumas vs. the Lady
Cougars.
Hupfer and Clark entered the
game as the conference’s two
leading scorers. Hupfer, the
reigning GLVC Player of the
Year, was averaging 24 points per
game compared to Clark’s 22.4.
The Lady Cougars (13-5
overall, 8-4 GLVC) put the
sideshow out of the spotlight by
taking an early 11-10 lead
without Clark hitting one basket.
Clark assisted forward Crystal
Gladson on two passes inside,
sparking an 8-0 run by the Lady
Cougars. SIUE led 19-10.
The Lady Pumas (5-13, 3-9)
got back into the game despite
turning over the ball 11 times in
the first half. Hupfer hit a
baseline jump shot to cut SIUE’s

lead to 30-27.
But before Hupfer and the
Lady
Pumas
could
gain
momentum, the Lady Cougars

took over. SIUE guard Heather
Hillebrenner hit a three7point
shot and Sarah Larson converted
a three-point play to key a 12-0

Cougars end losing streak
Five SIUE players reach double digits in win over Pumas
BY RICK CROSSIN
ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR
The SIUE men’s basketball
team was riding a three-game
losing streak going into Saturday
night’s matchup against St.
Joseph’s College, but Nick
Hartwig made sure that number
didn’t reach four.
Hartwig scored 15 points
and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead
the Cougars to a 78-74 win
homecoming night at the
Vadalabene Center.
“He had a career night
tonight,” head coach Jack
Margenthaler said. “He was our
player of the game.”
The Cougars started the
game with a bang as center Dion
Perkins slammed home SIUE’s
first two baskets.
After Perkins’ dunks, SIUE
began to play ragged. This was
due primarily to the full-court
pressure put on by the Pumas.
“Against the press, our plan
was to attack the basket,”
Margenthaler said.

SIUE had trouble getting the
ball in bounds and was constantly
being trapped in the comers by
St. Joseph’s. When the Cougars
did break the pressure, they
scored easily.
St. Joseph’s leading scorer,
Romano Dees, did not start the
game, but when he did come in,
he made an immediate impact.
The Cougars were down 1412 when Dees began his personal
highlight show. Dees scored the
next three baskets for the Pumas,
the last of which was an alleyoop dunk the home crowd
admired with “oohs” and “ahhs.”
SIUE fought back to tie the
score at 20 on a give-and-go
layup from Ryan Sexson to
Travis Wallbaum.
The Cougars continued to
struggle with the press by St.
Joseph’s. Margenthaler believes
this was due to the fact that point
guard and primary ballhandler Ty
Moss wasn’t in the lineup.
“He’s our starting point
guard, and without him, we are
going to struggle against

presses,” Margenthaler said.
The score was once again
tied at 22 when SIUE tried to
match Dees’ alley-oop with one
of it’s own, but Perkins’ couldn’t
handle the errant pass from
Wallbaum.
SIUE took a four-point lead
midway through the first half on
a fast-break layup by Sexson.
That lead would not last long as
Puma guard Brent Mason buried
a three-pointer to cut the lead to
one.
With SIUE clinging to the
lead and the first half winding
down, Hartwig took over. He
scored the Cougars’ next seven
points as SIUE regained the lead.
The
lead
once
again
evaporated quickly as Mason
dropped two three-point bombs
for the Pumas to tie the score at
35.
SIUE finished the half with a
buzzer-beating
layup
by
sophomore forward Marty Perry
as the teams went into the locker
room tied at 37.

run by the Lady Cougars late in
the half.
Although
Clark
was
struggling from the field, she led
the team with five assists in the
half. Gladson scored 11 points,
while center Sarah Cook had
eight points and forward Sarah
Sollberger knocked down two
three-point baskets for six points.
The Lady Cougars led 42-32 at
the buzzer.
Forward Tamara Bumpers
was the leading scorer for the
Lady Pumas at the half with 12
points and Hupfer was right
behind her with 10 points of her
own. Jill Masters was the team’s
leading rebounder with five.
SIUE head coach Wendy
Hedberg thought the Lady
Cougars needed to work harder
on the boards in the second half,
although her team out-rebounded
St. Joseph’s 25-24.
“We did a much better job in
the second half,” Hedberg said. “I
thought we controlled the boards
better, which gave us the outlet
and the opportunity to run.”
St. Joseph’s looked like a
different team when the second
half started. The Lady Pumas
went on an 8-0 tear, which
included two SIUE turnovers and
two Hupfer baskets. Hedberg was
forced to call a timeout and let the
stunned
Lady
Cougars
recuperate.
The Lady Cougars then

looked like a different team by
breaking out on an 8-0 run of
their own and bringing their lead
back to 10 points. Four different
SIUE players scored during the
drive, including a breakaway
layup by Clark.
The Lady Cougars gained a
comfortable lead but were not
ready to quit. SIUE stretched its
lead to 23 points when Liz
DeShasier made a basket from a
long pass by Clark. DeShasier,
who scored a career-high eight
points, was one of eight bench
players to see action for SIUE in
the game.
Hedberg thinks her bench is
very capable of coming into the
game and scoring points and was
happy those players could see
some time since the Lady
Cougars had a healthy lead.
“Fortunately we had a game
like this tonight where they could
get some good minutes,”
Hedberg said.
The SIUE bench ran up the
score and ran out the clock en
route to a convincing 82-55 win.
Gladson lead the team with 18
points, just one point shy of her
career high.
Gladson was happy to come
through for her team after
suffering a heartbreaking loss to
conference-leading
Northern
Kentucky University just one
week earlier.

combined.
Senior Chenoa Glenn was
the only member of either squad
to win an event. Glenn won the
women’s 400-meter dash with a
time of 1-minute, .28 seconds,
barely edging Illinois State’s Jene

Head coach Darryl Frerker
thinks Glenn’s consistency is a
result of her strong mental game.
“Over the last few years,
she’s been very dedicated to her
training session of her season,”
Frerker said. “She came away
with another excellent race.”
Junior Tamekia Howard and
freshman Jessica Conley also

The teams continued to trade
baskets until St. Joseph’s guard
Hodges Smith scored to give the
Pumas a 55-52 lead.
No player from either team
was in foul trouble during the
course of the game, but both
teams were in the double-bonus
with six minutes remaining.
SIUE was ahead 64-61 when
Wallbaum caught the Pumas
napping and zipped a backdoor
pass to McKinzie to give the
Cougars a five-point lead.

The Cougars would never
trail again as Perry made four
clutch free throws in the final
minute of the game to secure the
win.
“Marty’s one of the better
free-throw shooters on our team,”
Margenthaler said.
j With the win, the Cougars
improved their record in the
Great Lakes Valley Conference to
5-8 and 9-10. The Cougars will

Carlyle Lake is administered by the Corp of Engineers and
is the largest man-made reservoir in Illinois. The lake was
created by damming the Kaskaskia River. Volunteers are needed
to assist with the building of the spawning beds and other park
maintenance to prepare for the spring, summer, and fall
recreation. The spawning beds provide fish with a habitat to lay
eggs, protection, and provide food during the spawning period.
These volunteer projects allow you to explore and become
involved in the community, meet new people, and gain
community service hours toward the Student Leadership
Development Program.

Individual and Group Participation Wanted!
