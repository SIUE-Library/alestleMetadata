Music professor retires after
31 years of teaching at SIUE
By Dustin Powell
Courtesy o f UNS
Nearly 50 years ago W arren Joseph
made a prom ise to himself: he was going to
teach for 50 years. O n August 31, when he
walks off the Southern Illinois University at
Edwardsville campus for the last time as a
professor, he will have kept that promise.
Joseph is a professor of music and
director of the music com puter lab at SIU E
and will be retiring from the university
after 31 years of service.
“My years here have been both
rewarding and interesting,” Joseph said. “I
didn’t come here to do what I do now, so
it’s been a time of real change and grow th.”
Joseph came to SIU E to teach music
education, that is, to teach students how to
learn music. He is still teaching music to
students, but he now uses a m ethod that
was unavailable to him when he first
started. H e teaches with the aid of
com puters.
“I becam e interested in it because I
believed com puterization was som ething
worth doing and could m ake a difference in
music education,” Joseph said.
SIU E first experienced com puterized

music learning in 1977 when they started
with just one com puter located in Joseph’s
office. In 1984, the university assembled a
music com puter lab, which Joseph still
oversees.
•
W hen Joseph came to SIU E in 1965 as a
tenured professor, he had no idea he would
someday teach music to students using
com puters. As a m atter of fact, in his early
years he spent m ore time on the
adm inistrative side of education than he
did in the classroom. In 1969, Joseph was
asked by then-C hancellor John Rendlem an
to serve as assistant vice president of
Academ ic Affairs; he accepted the position
and served for eight years, until Chancellor
R endlem an passed away, at which time he
returned to the music departm ent full time.
However, even when he was serving as
an adm inistrator, Joseph taught one class
each term , a provision he insisted on before
accepting the position.
“The students are the most im portant
/thing and I w anted to stay in contact with
them ,” he said.
The students have always been Joseph’s
focus. “I describe myself in one word: a
‘potentialist,’” he said. “ I assume that each
student has the potential to do som ething

M eetings are currently in the
works betw een Student Body
P resident C hristopher Nance
and university officials to form
a University Police Advisory
Council. Nance first m et with
the university two weeks ago.
Nance said the purpose of
the board was to clear up any
m isunderstandings between the
students
and
staff
and
university police regarding
policies and procedures.
“To
ensure
the
right
conception and p ercep tio n
from
the
university
(population) to police and the
police
to
the
university
(population.) To let them know
how we (students and staff)
stand against certain issues,”
Nance said.
Vice
C h ancellor
of
A dm inistration Ken N eher is
ready to cooperate with Nance
to get the system going.
“I, along with Dr. (N arbeth)
Em m anuel and C hief (Charles)
M cD onald, m et with C hris
N ance two w eeks ago. We
proposed a com m unity police
resource council very similar to
C hris’s proposal,” N eher said.
“Chris said he would get back
to us with nam es of faculty and
students who want to be part of
the cdundH.”
On Monday, July 15, Nance
sent
a
m em o
to
Vice
C hancellor
E m m anuel
suggesting organizations that
should be represented on the
council. T hese included the
Black S tud en t A ssociation,
G reek Council, International

S tudent C ouncil, R esidence
Hall, and Student G overnm ent.
Faculty and staff would be
rep resen ted by two faculty
m em bers, and staff m em bers
from the Kimmel Leadership
Center, the University C enter
and University Housing.
The C ouncil’s task would be
to advise the C hief of Police on
m atters relating to how well
the police departm ent is doing
its jo b , types of program ,
staffing,
policies
and
procedures, unit budget, and
general operations.
N eher hopes the board will
accomplish several things.
“O u r goal is (for the police)
to be m o re a p art of the
community, to have police in
daily contact with faculty and
stu d en ts instead of only in
em ergency occurrences at
Tower Lake and on cam pus,”
N eher said.
Not every stu d en t on
campus believes the board will
work. Michael Jones, a junior
m ajoring
in
elem entary
education, is doubtful.
“ I feel it’s a good idea,
however, w hoever is on the
board needs to be strong. The
police will try to blow over the
heads of the board. They d o n ’t
really care ab out students.
W hoever is on the board must
be a strong representative for
the students,” Jones said.
N ance hopes to have the
program im plem ented no later
than this fall semester.
(U niversity Police C hief )
M cD onald
has
been
in
meetings for the past couple of
days and was unable to be
reached for comment.

and it’s my job to give them the encouragem ent and the tools to do it. It’s

Joseph believes that a positive attitude m akes an enorm ous difference and
he does w hat he can to help the students achieve and m aintain a positive
attitude.
“I t’s im portant to bring out the good parts; not to focus on the mistakes, but
instead on what they do right,” he said. The rewards of teaching, to Joseph,
are seeing the growth that takes place with each student. But there is a flip
side to that: “You never bat a thousand. T here are some students you just
d o n ’t reach.” A fter 50 years of teaching he knows that.
The; music professor’s first teaching jo b was in Potsdam , N. Y., the same city
where he graduated from college. A fter com pleting his degree at New York
State University, he w orked for four years at a local high school. “I was the
music teacher,” he said. “A real one-m an band, so to speak.”
A fter leaving Potsdam , he attended Columbia University, where he
com pleted his m aster’s while teaching at a private school in R iverdale, N.Y.
A fter Columbia, he headed to H arvard to work on his doctorate, but had to
m ake a change after a short time there.
“A t H arvard they were interested in what happened 100 years ago and
what will happen 100 years from now. But, there was a section they were
missing that interested m e,” Joseph said.
His move landed him at B oston University, where he received his Ph.D. in
music education and educational adm inistration. Within that tim e fram e that
he was working on his doctorate, Joseph m aintained a high school teaching

Wednesday, July 17, 1996

job, worked part-tim e at two colleges, conducted the John Hancock Chorus,
m arried and was blessed with the birth of his first child.
“It was a very busy time for m e,” he said.
A fter receiving his doctorate, Joseph took a job as chairm an of Music
Education and director of Choral Activities at Southern Mississippi University,
where he stayed two years. His next move took him to Bowling G reen State
University in Ohio as director of C horal Activities.
While working in Ohio, Joseph served as consultant to Eastern Michigan
University during a search for a chairperson for the E M U music departm ent.
“By the time it was all over they had asked me to be the chair and I
accepted,” he said. “I left there in 1965 when I came to S IU E .”
In addition to teaching, Joseph has been working on com puter hardware
and software that he has designed over the years. The two are accom panied by
a book w ritten by Joseph and titled “Music to L earn Music By.”
“ I’ve been working on it for 10 to 12 years and it’s still going,” he said.
A fter retirem ent, he plans to travel and sell the products h e’s designed. “I ’ll
still be teaching; I’ll teach teachers how to teach music using my m aterials as a
vehicle,” Joseph said, who sees his travels not only as a business move but also
a chance for him and his wife, Peggy, to see the country.
Family is very im portant to him. His wife and two daughters, M argaret and
Elizabeth, have m ade life complete. W hat do they think of his retirem ent?
“I’m sure they don’t believe it will happen,” Joseph said with a chuckle.
W hat does W arren Joseph think about retirem ent? “Am I ready for
retirem ent? Yes and no. I’ll miss a lot of things, but there are a lot of others
things I ’d like to do,” he said. W hen reflecting on his years as a teacher,
Joseph said it rem inds him of the inscription on a sundial: “ I only record the
sunny hours.”

letter to the editor

editorial •

In defense of meaningful
heterosexual marriage

Alcoholic beverage companies profit
from America’s teenagers

In response to Michael
F lota’s letter to the editor,
July 10, supporting same sex
marriage, I offer some
comments. H e refers to the ,
Defense of (conventional)
m arriage act as “bigotry,” as
an “attack “ on homosexual
rights by “radical”
conservatives with an “evil
agenda” to engage in
“unconstitutional
repression” and “oppress”
minorities globally. Then he
says society must replace
capitalistic greed and
hierarchy with co-operation
and equality.
Many conservatives dislike
greed and hierarchy as much
as does Michael, but would
doubt that capitalism is m ore
prone to that than is
socialism. We also favor co­
operation and equality, but
com petition can’t be all bad
either, or M ichael would stop
competing with conservatives
and others in the m arketplace
of ideas (that m eans the
newspaper, etc.).
Michael says people of the
country or a certain political
persuasion, but they can be
fired for being homosexual.
In fact, there are residency
laws which m akes people
from the wrong parts of the
country ineligible for some
jobs. I doubt that
homosexuals are more
wronged in the job m arket
than others. I can’t get a lot
of jobs because I have long
hair, “whiskers” and a missing
tooth. H e says the Walt
Disney company is being
boycotted for giving the same
benefits to homosexual
couples as to heterosexuals. I
believe the boycott is mainly
about subliminal
pornographic messages in
several Disney cartoons of
recent years, possibly created
by gay artists, as was shown
on a prim e time TV news
show.

Raising children is the
most im portant task of any
society and it is a difficult
one. It surely is in society’s
best interests to provide some
benefits to those who have, or
adopt, kids. Studies seem to
show strongly that traditional
tw o-parent families provide
the optim al setting for kids
growing up. I’ll grant that
m arried people who have no
kids may not deserve benefits
that non-m arried people
d o n ’t have. A nd “single”
people who have or adopt
kids may deserve some
special benefits, but not as
many as m arried couples.
The main reason I think
same-sex m arriage would be
unwise is that, if m arriage
benefits were given to
homosexuals, they would also,
then, have to be extended to
anyone else who wanted
them. A fter all, two
room m ates who don’t have
sex should have the same
rights as two homosexuals
who do have sex. M arried
people are not merely
“dom estic partners,” as
Michael calls them, but they
are, m ore im portantly,
potential or actual parents.
Michael did not describe the
“attackers” of homosexual
prom oters as “hom ophobes,”
but those who use the term
should ponder the term
“heterophobia.”
Now let’s discuss real
issues, like abolishing the
death penalty and war and
supporting the rights of
children, including the
unborn (even if they are
minorities, potential
homosexuals, or disabled).

Assistant News Editor
W hen
you
think
of
underage drinking, what
image comes to m ind? A 20year-old with a fake ID in a
club with friends? O r a 14year-old passing a bottle at
a party? How about a 10year-old sneaking a beer
from the fridge while mom
and dad are gone?
Last spring, I helped
chaperone
a
D .A .R .E.
“g ra d u atio n ” party. Many
schools are incorporating the
D rug
A buse
R esistance
Education program into their
fifth-grade curricula and
sponsor a party for students
at the end of the year. This
particular party was held at a
sports and fitness center in
town with pizza and pop on
the menu. Shortly after the
party started, a couple of girls
w alked by, giggling and
passing a bottle betw een
th e m . I d id a d o u b l e ta k e . Was that a wine cooler
they had?
No, the fitness ce n te r’s
“health b ar” sold Mystic, a
fruity beverage th at looks
rem arkably like a wine
cooler, even down to the
shape of the bottle. I pointed
out the irony of kids swigging
this drink at a D A R E party to
the D A R E officer. H e told
me that because the owners
of the club were letting the
group use the space for free,
he felt he couldn’t ask them
not to sell their beverages.
My im pression of these
girls (and other kids I saw
th at night) was th at they
thought they w ere “cool.”
You could tell they were
treating it like alcohol.
According to David Walsh,
junior and senior high school
students drink 35% o f all
wine coolers sold in the U. S.

W alsh is the au th o r of
“Selling
O ut
A m eric a’s
Children: How A m erica Puts
Profits B efore Values— and
W hat Parents Can Do.”
In 1992, 87.5 percent of
high school seniors said they
used alcohol at least once.
Why do children as young
as eight and nine start
drinking
alcohol?
P eer
pressure is one answer. A nd
certainly w hat goes on at
hom e can be a factor;
escaping family problem s is
one reason m any adults
drink. But even with the most
stable hom e life, som e
children
begin
drinking.
Why?
Think m arketing. Three of
the most popular icons today
are the Budweiser frogs. Not
too long ago it was Spuds
McKenzie, also of Budweiser fame:
O ne of advertising’s goals
is to attract new users for a
com panies products and the
beer and wine m akers are
trying to cash in.
According to the Illinois
D rug E ducation Alliance, the
May 1995 “Beverage Industry
News” carried a full page ad
introducing Tum blers G elatin
Shots, “radically new and very
profitable.” Tumblers are sold
in small plastic containers, are
m ade with gelatin and vodka
or rum and come in orange,
straw berry,
cherry
and
lemon-lime flavors. They are
24 proof and sell for 99c. I
d o n ’t know about you, but I
don’t know too many
21-year-olds
who
would
ordinarily like orange gelatin.
T G I F riday’s m ark ets a
line of liqueurs packaged in
1.5 oz. bottles with nam es like
O atm eal
C ookie,
B-52,
Lem on D rop and B utter Ball,
selling for just over a dollar.
The U.S. alcohol industry isn’t
the only one aiming for the
younger crowd. New brands

of pop, cider and lem onade
are being sold in Australia.
With nâm es like X LR8 and
E33, they contain a minimum
of 4.2 percent alcohol and are
m arketed for 18- to 30-yearolds.
A lcohol ads show thin,
happy,
beautiful
people
having fun. W hen you’re in
the throes of adolescence and
searching for your identity,
th ese ads . can be very
powerful messages.
Teens are big risk-takers,
particularly males. I t’s no
surprise, then, th at alcohol
ads involve a lot of high-risk,
high-energy activities such as
skydiving o r car racing.
Sports are ano th er favorite
them e of these companies.
I w onder why m ore people
d o n ’t question the irony of
b eer com panies sponsoring
“drug-free” Olym pians or the
fact that G ra n t’s Farm, hom e
of
the
A nheuser-B usch
Clydesdales, is such a popular
p la c e to ta k e th e k id s
(w h e re they sell T-shirts and
caps with the s c re a m in g “A ”
a n d eag le, n o less).
Alcohol is big business in
A m erica. This $23 billion
industry em ploys over 52,000
people, from the m akers to
the waitress and bartender at the
comer tavern.
A nheuser-B usch
spent
$30 million in 1989 on
public service ads cautioning
drinkers to “Know when to
say w hen,” to co u n teract
criticism of th eir Spuds
M cKenzie ads. They spend
$635 m illion a year to
encourage people to drink.
I’m not advocating we
re tu rn to th e days of
Prohibition with it’s bootleg
liquor and bathtub gin. I just
think that we as parents and
m em bers of the com m unity
need to take a closer look at
how alcohol is m arketed.

History of Ice Cream

Tasty trivia

A.D. 54-68
I scream, you scream ... Sound familiar? If not, it
should by the time July 22 rolls around. What's so
special about July 22? And why will those screams
for ice cream be especially loud on that day? Well,
because July 22 is National Ice Cream Day.
So, in honor of a day completely devoted to that
cold, creamy treat and its tasty accessories, The
Alestle conducted a survey of 80 people on campus
about... what else? Ice cream.
Besides the usual questions about favorite and
not-so-favorite flavors, participants were also asked
to pick their favorite place to eat ice cream. Other than the grocery store and Dairy Queen,
the third favorite frozen dessert haven turned out to
be Bobby's in Maryville.
Bobby Kozyak, 42, who owns and manages the
frozen custard stand with his wife, explained the
differences between frozen custard and ice cream:
"We have handmade machines that add virtually
no air to the product, which makes it a smoother,
denser and creamier texture than even the most
premium ice creams."
But the machines aren't the only things that make
the difference. The product itself is one of the main
differences between the two frosty foods. Whereas
ice cream usually contains 10 percent milk fat, the
custard at Bobby's contains 10 percent butter fat. It
also contains eggs and a secret ingredient that only
the Kozyaks know. There is also a Lite product
available, which contains 2% butter fat. And just
because there's less of the good stuff, the overall
creamy and custardy taste is not compromised.
"We feel our Lite is really excellent," said Kozyak.
"You don't feel like you're getting cheated."
So whatever it is you're after—rwhether it's a Dairy
Queen blizzard with big chunks of cookie dough, a
pint of Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey from the
supermarket or a turtle sundae from Bobby's—treat
yourself to a cold treat on the day reserved for such
indulgences.

First known use of a
chilly treat. Nero Claudius Caesar of
Rome mixed snow with fruit juices.

Did you know ...

seaweed is an ingredient?
Algin, a cream-colored powder,
comes from kelp. It is used to ensure
creaminess and to prevent ice crystals
from forming.

13th century Marco Polo returns
to Italy from the Far East with a frozen
dessert recipe that called for milk.

1700 Ice cream reaches America.
Gov. William Bladen of Maryland
served ice cream with strawberries
and milk to a guest.

there are at least 400 flavors?
Like potatoes and bacon, mustard and
squash. There was even a flavor created by
Good Humor called chili con came.

Americans eat the most ice cream?

1 8 12 Dolley Madison serves ice
cream in the White House.

Studies have shown that Americans consume 14
quarts per capita annually. That's more than a
quart a month.

1846 Nancy Johnson invents the
hand-cranked ice cream freezer.

a quart used to cost 65 cents?

1851 Jacob Fussell establishes
first ice cream manufacturing
business in Baltimore.

And that was expensive for the late 1800s. When
Jacob Fussell opened an ice cream business in
1851 in Baltimore, he decided to charge only 25
cents a quart!

1896 Italo Marchiony invents
the first ice cream cone.

ingredient: milk. And that leads to the cow. On the average, milk from a
cow contains about 87 percent water, 4 percent milk fat, protein and
lactose. Although there are other types of fats, a product must only contain
milk fat in order to be called "ice cream."
Ice cream is a mixture of cream, mifk, sweeteners, flavorings and air.
The amount of air in a product is related to the quality of the ice cream.
Premium ice creams, such as Haagen-Dasz, do not contain as much air.
Since a smaller amount of air is beaten into the higher premium ice
creams, they are much more denser than the economy ice creams.
Premium ice creams also contain additional milk fat, which is the
ingredient responsible for the texture and taste of ice cream.
Regular ice cream contains at least 10 percent milk fat, and ice milk
contains 2-7 percent milk fat. Any light ice cream is federally required to
have no more than half the fat content of the regular version. Low*fat
products can contain no more than 3 fat grams per serving.

Soccer has its turn at camps

Todd Spann/ Alestte

The SIUE campus is home to soccer players from around the area this week as the school is hosting soccer camps to players of all ages. The children
participate in soccer drills and scrimmages over by the SIUE athletic fields. SIUE has been hosting camps ail summer long and this is just one of the many
sports youth can enjoy here.

NBA teams shells out big bucks to free agents
(A P )
O ne w eekend into the free agent m arket and
nearly half a billion dollars has already been spent.
T he Miami H eat and New York Knicks are in for
$350 million, the Indiana Pacers have com m itted $80
million and the Los A ngeles Lakers are waiting for
Shaquille O ’Neal to answer their $95 million offer.
All around the N BA , team s are lining up with tens
of millions m ore, and the best players lucky enough
to be w ithout contracts are enjoying an
unprecedented payday.
“ I'm firing my mother. She’s off the Barkley
payroll. She had me too soon,” C harles Barkley said
Sunday as the first wave of m ovem ent and signings
took place.
Juwan H ow ard, the 23-year-old forward from the
W ashington Bullets, reportedly agreed to a sevenyear, $98 million deal with Miami. The H eat also was
said to have agreed to term s with A lonzo M ourning
on a seven-year contract w orth $105 million.
Miami still has $2 million-$3 million of salary cap
room and still needs a point guard, especially if Tim
H ardaw ay agrees" to a free agent deal with H ouston
— and Pat Riley may pursue D erek H arper, whose
rights w ere renounced by the New York Knicks on
Sunday.
T hat allowed New York to sign free agent guards
A llan H ouston (D etroit) and Chris Childs (New
Jersey) and finalize a trade for two-time A ll-Star and
form er overall No. 1 pick Larry Johnson.
C harlotte received forw ard A nthony M ason and
center B rad Lohaus from the Knicks.
H ouston will get $56 million over seven years and
Childs gets $24 million over six years.
“We hit the jackpot,” general m anager Ernie
G runfeld said. “W e’ll be one of the top team s
com peting for the cham pionship, not only this year
but for years to com e.”
The Pistons w ere angry that they didn’t have a
chance to respond to the Knicks’ offer to H ouston,
one o f the best young shooting guards in the league.
“ I was surprised because if m oney was the issue, he
could have gotten m ore m oney from us. The trum p

card we had was w e’d pay him m ore money,” Pistons
vice president R ick Sund said. “ Obviously, he
elected not to play in D etroit.”
Early Saturday morning, H ouston told the Knicks
he’d accept their offer. If H ouston had wavered,
Grunfeld was ready to call Reggie M iller’s agent.
“You’ve got a lot of players that probably haven’t

got to the playoffs yet or the second round that are
m aking $10 million plus. T hat I d o n ’t agree with,”
Miller said after the U.S. Olympic Team beat G reece
128-62. M iller was the leading scorer in the D ream
Team ’s five exhibition games, averaging 14.2 points.
A nother Olym pian, Barkley, said the N B A had
squashed the proposed three-team trade that would
have sent him to the H ouston R ockets, Sam Cassell
and R o b ert H orry to D enver and D ikem be
M utom bo to Phoenix.
“O ne of my agents said the league w ouldn’t let the
deal go through because too much tam pering had

been involved,” Barkley said. " I think th at’s gutless
on the part of the N B A because everybody has
tam pered. To hold me hostage because they’re
trying to prove a point is unfair.”
Miller, upon hearing B arkley’s conspiracy theory,
took an easy shot at his D ream Teammate.
“W hatever Charles says, do not believe him,”
M iller said.
M utom bo is a free agent and may be able to get a
better offer than the $8.5-$9 million annually that
the Suns would have paid him in the proposed
B arkley deal. T he A tlanta Hawks were believed to
be offering close to $10 million annually for seven
years, and D etroit was in on the bidding as well.
G ary Payton agreed to a seven-year, $85 million
contract with the SuperSonics, the team he led to the
N B A Finals last year. The H eat were the last team to
have a shot at Payton after the Knicks, Hornets,
Rockets and Bucks dropped out, but they lost out
when Seattle increased its offer. The signing was to
be announced today.
“I d on’t need M ichael money. I’m glad with what
I’ve got. M ike w anted one year, I wanted seven, so
I’m all right,” Payton said in reference to Michael
Jo rd an ’s one-year, $25 million contract with the
Bulls.
The Lakers, who have offered about $95 million
over seven years to O ’Neal, lost a chance to sign
D ale Davis as they w aited for O ’Neal to make up his
m ind betw een Los A ngeles and Orlando.
“T he financial package will be incredible, so it’s not
som ething we’re dwelling on,” said O ’N eal’s agent,
L eo n ard A rm ato. “T he m ain factors are the
likelihood of a cham pionship and the feeling Shaq
has about the city. O rlando wants us to explore the
options, then they’ll put their best foot forw ard.”
Davis, told the L akers w anted to wait for O ’Neal,
chose to re-sign with Indiana for seven years and $42
m illion, sources said. In d ian a also reached
agreem ent with A ntonio Davis, who will re-sign for
$38.5 million over seven years.
