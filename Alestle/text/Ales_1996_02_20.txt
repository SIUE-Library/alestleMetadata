on Feb. 26 in W ashington D.C.
T he R ivers p ro ject is an environm ental education program founded by
W illiams in 1990. O riginally launched at eight high schools along the M ississippi
and low er Illinois River, the program has grown to include nearly 600 schools
nationw ide.
T he p ro g ram ’s goal is to educate students about issues involving the w ater
supply so that they can m ake inform ed decisions in the future.
R a th e r than pushing an agenda, the program strives to inform students about
the problem s involved in w ater treatm ent.
“ Kids have to deal with that. I t’s real life and I think th a t’s why the kids have
responded and why the project has grow n,” W illiams said. “ I think as teachers we
all have points of view, we all have biases. W hen y o u ’re a teacher, you try to
p resen t as m any points of view as you can.”
In addition to teaching students how to collect and analyze w ater sam ples, the
program provides students with two publications w here they can share w hat they
have learned.

letter to the editor---------------------------------------------------------

Steve and D.C. article not
good objective journalism
In her Feb.15 editorial, Alestle Assistant Lifestyle E ditor Jennifer
Casey defended her Steve and DC m orning show feature, claiming that
it “was not a one-sided kiss-up story.”
It is blatantly one-sided on three points, and this compromises Casey
as an objective journalist.
The vital fact that these two deejays were dismissed three years ago
for using racial slurs on the air appears nowhere in the story. This
controversy could have provided some insight into Steve and DC.
Unfortunately, this fact seems to have been conveniently omitted.
Opposing viewpoints are m entioned only in passing. Casey writes,
“Critics have com pared them to post-adolescent Beavis and Butthead.
Others have labeled them unethical, immoral, or just plain nuts.” Not
one person critical of Steve and DC was interviewed to support these
generalizations.
Finally, the personalized “thank you” following the story is highly
unprofessional and throws any remaining shred of objectivity out the
window. It sounds m ore like a campaign speech for an internship.
G ranted, this story is not hard news. But there is a story here; Casey
just didn’t flesh it out. Stories like this one ham per a journalist’s
credibility and do a disservice to the readers.
Please note- This is not an indictm ent of Casey’s character, just her
reporting.

letter to the editor_______________________________ :------------------

Alestle wasted space on Steve and D.C.
WOW! I wrote two sentences on Steve and DC, and half a page of the Alestle gets
devoted to blasting me. Sure is fascinating what happens when you attack a sacred cow!
You’d almost think I’d said they should be banished from the airwaves, when all I did
was question giving them a page of scarce space in the Alestle. If it’s true that they are
“rehabilitated,” I’m delighted. I genuinely hope so, because using racist slurs like they
did is totally unacceptable behavior that ought to be roundly condem ned by everyone
of good will. Gee, maybe now 1 can even look forward to them actively joining the
effort to com bat racial discrim ination and polarization in the St. Louis area!
Please be inform ed that I’m very ready to adm it they have the most listeners of any
m orning radio show in this area. I knew that when I wrote my letter. But what does that
prove? The m ere fact that they are popular in St. Louis d oesn’t prove that they aren't
racists. A fter all, we are talking about an area that consistently rates am ong the ten or
twelve most racially segregated m etropolitan areas in the country.
It is interesting that one of the articles criticizing me says “ D o n ’t Listen!” while the
o ther attacks me for presumably not listening to them. (You’re right, I d on’t- except for
one m orning when the dial on my clock radio got bum ped over to the wrong station.
Talk about a rude awakening!) So, I guess I get blasted either way. But th at’s O K — the
authors of those letters have as much right to criticize me as I have to criticize Steve
and DC. But what I won’t do is simply rem ain silent when in my opinion the Alestle
wastes scarce space on things of dubious value. To devote that much space to two
popular icons with a highly questionable past seems to be a m isplaced priority in light
of the many serious issues faced by our campus and com m unity that the Alestle could
have used that space to cover. A nd in the interest of conserving that scarce space, this
is the last thing I will have to say in writing on this subject.

open letter to the campus-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How many more times must we say it? Please turn yourself in!
PLEASE TURN YOURSELF IN!!!
This letter is a plea from students to students to
turn themselves in for phone fraud. The students on
the Student G overnm ent, Personnel/Public
R elations board are concerned about the problem s
students will face if they fail to turn them selves in.
The school is working very hard to recover their
lost funds. And after the deadline set for the
Am nesty period, “the kid gloves will come off” said
K enneth N eher, Vice C hancellor of Adm inistration.
Many students have expressed that they don’t
believe that the school can determ ine who has used
the codes, but believe it, there are many phone

tracking vehicles being used. O ther students believe
since the school has not contacted them about their
charges it is because the school does not know who
the students are. W rong again. If you have ever
used your perm anent hom e num ber that is on file
with the school or the school call edge card, those
num bers have been cross referenced with the illegal
num ber codes. Some of the consequences students
will face after the am nesty period include: any
student holding a University job will be term inated;
depending on the am ount owed, students will be
facing criminal charges; students will go before the
school review board and international students may

face deportation. It is not worth it for any student
to get kicked out of school for telephone fraud.
True, we agree the school was at fault for letting
this process to drag on unnoticed, but true or not,
the m oney has to be paid. Please, students, we
encourage you to take advantage of the Am nesty
Program or you may end up paying an even higher
price.
Student Government, Personnel/Public
Relations Board

Campus Comments
How do you feel about the proposed parking sticker price increase?

“I think the repairs need
to be made, but the increase
is too much. Most of us arc
too poor anyway to pay the
existing price to park 1 172
miles away.”

“It S-U-C-K-S-!”

Leon Jefferson
Jr., Physical Education

“I feel the repairs arc
necessary and increasing the
fee $10 a year is more
reasonable.”

“ It doesn't make any
sense. What ¡s happening to
all the money from parking
tickets?”

“ It costs enough as it is. So
if they raise the prices, stop
giving tickets.”

The survey is to see exactly where people are on
the subject of recycling and to prom ote awareness of
recycling and its effects on the environm ent,
A nderson also said.
In addition to the survey, SEA C is also passing
around a petition on campus in order to m otivate the
University C enter to purchase aluminum canned
beverages instead of glass and plastic, since
aluminum is easier to recycle.
SEA C needs 25 percent of the student population
to sign the petition in order to get the legislation
passed, A nderson said.
Petitions can be found in the Kimmel Leadership
C enter located in the UC.
O ther future projects sponsored by the SEA C
include an Earth Day concert in the Q uad featuring
the band Proud Flesh, and a “Clean Up H ike” to

pick up trash around cam pus is also being planned.
Besides recycling, the SEA C is also interested in
com batting pollution, im proving the ground and
drinking w ater supply, and heightening awareness of
environm ental issues on campus.
SEA C began in the spring of 1988 when students
at the University of N orth Carolina at Chapel Hill

asking students interested in forming a netw ork to

SE A C , which is m ainly a letter-w riting

T h e p ro je c t new sletter,
W ater W atcher’s Log, and
M ean d erin g s, a stu d en ta u th o re d
p u b licatio n ,
provide stu dents with places
to voice th e ir co n cerns
ab o u t th e issues they are
studying.
T he p ro g ram ’s grow th has
coincided with the rise of
w ater supply issues across
the country. T hese issues are
u n likely
to
d isa p p e a r
anytim e soon.
“T he next ten o r tw enty
years are going to see m ore
and m ore w a te r supply
issues
em e rg e ,”
said
Williams.
In o rd e r to succeed, the
program hopes to show a
g en eratio n of students the
im portance of w ater supply
problem s.
“ We n eed to b uild up
lifelong learn in g . W e’ve
c re a te d a w hole recycling
g en e ra tio n
th ro u g h
education, now w e’ve got to
do
th at
w ith
w a te r,”
W illiams said.
C u rre n t
lack
of
know ledge ab o u t the effects
o f w a te r co n tam in atio n
illustrate the im portance of
the program .
A lthough legal standards
for m any contam inants have
b een estab lish ed , th e re is
little in fo rm atio n ab o u t
w hat th e co n tam inants do
when ingested.
“ W hen
c o n tam in ated
w a te r is con su m ed , the
toxicity of chem icals is so
m inute we d o n ’t know w hat
the results will be. I d o n ’t
know w hat it does to you—
in fact, n o b o d y k n o w s,”
W illiams said.
S tu d en ts are also faced
w ith q u estio n s ab o u t the
tra d e -o ff asso ciated w ith
c le a n e r
w ater.
M any
chem icals th at cause w ater
co n tam in atio n are found in
p esticid es
esse n tial
to
m axim izing
farm ing
production.
T he
p ro b lem
w ith
p esticid es stem s from the
fact th at they are designed
to kill certain plants in o rd er
to help others. F or exam ple,
th e
chem ical an tra zin e,
found in m ost w ater locally,
was created solely to kill.
“D o we w ant som ething
m ade solely to kill in o ur
b o d ies?” W illiams asked.
C lean w ater has becom e a
m ajor social issue affecting
th e w orld today, p artly
because of the condition of
m any
w a te r
tre a tm e n t
facilities.
“T h e w a te r tre a tm e n t
s tru c tu re s are old and in
n eed
of
re p a ir
and
re p la c e m e n t,”
W illiam s
said.
T he issue seem s to be one
of
lastin g
im p o rtan ce
because, as W illiams said,
“ You can live a long time
w ith o u t ea tin g , o v er a
m onth, b u t try to do that
w ith w a te r and i t ’s a

Delta’s Comedy Show:
Can we get a laugh?
By Darryl Howlett
Lifestyle Editor
O n Saturday, four com edians attem pted to
m ake SIU E laugh as part of the 3rd annual
D elta Sigma Theta Com edy Show. With the
show starting an hour and ten m inutes behind
schedule, I just knew the com edians would
m ake me cry with laughter. Obviously, the
audience must have thought the same.
M aster of Cerem onies was D arius B radford
who was ready to go an hour before the show
started. W hen B radford first came on stage, I
thought to myself, “Oh G od, this guy is drunk.”
His opening jokes did not go over well, and he
could sense that this crowd was not in a funny
mood.
The first com edian on stage, Rom an Murray,
was okay, but might have done better if he
knew the audience w anted him to be funny. He
m ade som ew hat ordinary jokes about the
weather. I was hoping he would do his Bill
Cosby on Star Trek joke but he was
intim idated by the crowd and got scared. This
really was the last straw for him.
The next com edian was A ndre Helm who,
instead of telling jokes, was m ore like a
preacher—and dressed like one in his shiny

suit. However, his jokes were m ore tolerable
than M urray’s. H elm ’s jokes touched on O.J.
Simpson to the characteristics of black people.
His jokes, though not outrageously funny, did
leave half the audience in a good mood.
In betw een comedians, B radford came out
m ore aggressive, determ ined to get the
audience to laugh if it killed him— and it
almost did. B radford had me going for awhile
with his jokes about the M eridian Ballroom
looking m ore like a gigantic tavern with lots of
card tables. He also joked about the students
on campus being criminals by phone-fraud.
Bradford saved the show.
The last com edian on stage, a veteran of D ef
Jam Comedy, showed it. Tony Skulfield was
one of the only com edians who cracked on
m em bers in the audience, from women with
little breasts trying to show them, to m en who
wear socks for so long they stand up straight by
themselves. Skulfield’s urban flavor alm ost
m ade the evening enjoyable. To me, Skulfield
and B radford saved the com edy show from
extinction.
To be fair to all the comedians, their jokes
might have gone over a lot better if the show
would have started on time. Then again, one
never knows.

Kermit strikes gold
with “Muppet
Treasure Island”
By Danette Watt
Lifestyle Reporter
It isn’t easy to find a movie that will hold the interest of both a four-year-old
and an eleven-year-old. It has to have enough action to interest the older one
w ithout a lot of violence for the younger one and still not be too saccharin-sweet
to be a turn-off to us all,
M uppet Treasure Island manages to m eet our high standards.
This Disney movie adds to the list of previous M uppet movies—that line-up
beginning with M uppets Take Manhattan, a classic which introduced us to some
of the best puppet characters around in a full-length feature.
The movie is a liberal interpretation of R obert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure
Island, yet the screenw riters stay close enough to the original plot so as to make
it recognizable. Still, th ere’s enough variation to it so that a frog, a pig, a rat, a
“w hatever” (as G onzo continually refers to himself throughout the movie) and
m ore can be included.
Kermit plays Capt. Smollet, who still yearns for his great love, Benjam ina
G unn (Miss Piggy). Kevin Bishop puts in a fine perform ance as young Jim
Hawkins, and Tim C urry is Long John Silver, the one-legged pirate who
befriends Jim.
Rizzo the R at and G onzo are cast as Jim ’s friends from the Benbow Inn
where the three lam ent their destiny as servers and yearn for adventure. Fozzie
B ear plays “sim ple-m inded” Squire Trelawney, allowing him to act as a comic foil
for the others.
The movie opens with “Shiver My Timbers,” a song that sets the mysterious
atm osphere of the movie but, which in stark contrast, is sung by a chorus of
totem poles, alligators, skulls and snakes.
There are enough songs to satisfy any fan of musicals and one of the best is
“Love Led Us H ere,” a duet sung by Miss Piggy and Kermit. Long John Silver
has suspended the pair over a cliff by ropes tied to their ankles while he goes off
to recover the treasure from Miss Piggy’s C arribean Island hut.
W hen I was
asked by the
Lifestyle E d itor to
write a weekly
colum n, mostly on
fam ily-related
issues, I thought,
“No sweat. I
should be able to
Family Corner
com e up with a
topic once a
By Danette Watt
w eek.”
Well, it isn’t
that easy. Not if I
w ant it to be m ore than just a forum for my own
opinions. A nd I d o n ’t think th ere’d be too many
readers left after a week or two of that.
Nobody said parenting was easy. But nobody
said we had to do it alone, either. G one are the
days when families stayed in the same town for
generations. In today’s m ore m obile society,
G randm a and G randpa are likely to be in
C alifornia while junior and his/her family are in
Florida.
Sometimes, G randm a and G randpa are acting
as parents for young children, raising a second
generation for w hatever reason. In 1993, there ,
w ere 3.4 million children under the age of 18 being
raised by their grandparents— representing 5
percent of all children under 18, up from 3 percent

When the devastatingly beautiful Miss Piggy is marooned on an island, she makes the best
of a bad situation by convincing the local warthogs that she's a jungle goddess until she's
finally reunited with her true love, Captain Smollett (Kermit). The two star in W alt Disney
Pictures "Muppet Treasure Island."

This love song, while sung by a frog and a pig, could very well make it’s way
to the airwaves because of its universal them e of love lost and found again.
It should go without saying that the kids in the audience loved the fight scene
the most. Pirates and M uppets engaged in a sword fight that culm inates in the
pirates being taken prisoner.
K erm it’s one-on-one with Long John Silver proves h e ’s “not bad for an
am phibian.” During his quick sword play, Kerm it cuts the buttons off Silver’s
coat and trims his hat, much to the young audience’s delight. Even Miss Piggy
gets into the act with her own style of aggressive whacks, landing a few wellplaced kicks on one pirate.
The movie, running just over an hour and a half, tells the story it needs to
without dragging it out and tiring little ones.
While it may not rank up there with Stevenson’s version of “Treasure Island”,
M uppet Treasure Island is sure to become a classic in its own right.
I give it 3 stars.

in W O .^ .e s e adults often find themselves with
little support from their peers because of the
disparity in their lifestyles. W hen their friends are
taking cruises, they are taking trips to the
pediatrician.
A nd if you’re one of the estim ated 8,961 single
parents in the country, it m akes it even tougher.
T here’s no live-in support system.
So who do you call when the going gets tough
and the tough need to get going? You could spend
a fortune on long-distance phone bills, calling
friends and family for advice. (A nd I did after the
birth of my first son. We were living in Connecticut
at the time and I knew no one. “first born child” is
just another phrase for “what the hell do I do
now ?”)
A fter a year in Connecticut, we moved to
Mississippi where we ended up staying for the next
five years. We moved there in January. In March,
my husband left for an 11-month deploym ent,
leaving me with a 16-month-old who was prone to
painful earaches and who never seemed to sleep
when I needed him to.
I can honestly say the only thing that saved my
sanity was the Mississippi G ulf Coast M others’
C enter, a m others’ support group about 50 miles
away from where I was living at the time. I’m not
even sure how I heard about it, but I became
involved with it to the point of beginning a center
closer to home.

Through that organization, I was able to
connect with women who were m ore experienced
m others than I with whom 1 could share
inform ation and advice. W ithout them, I d on’t
know how I w ould’ve m ade it through that rough
first deploym ent.
If you’re a parent in need of support, there are
local organizations you can contact. O ne I checked
out after the birth of my second son was Parents
Anonymous.
C ontrary to popular belief, P. A. isn’t just for
parents who beat their kids, (I didn’t!). It’s for any
parent who is searching for answers to easy as well
as difficult parenting questions. O ften, it’s the only
parent-support group around.
SIU single parents have one resource on
campus—the single parents support group held
weekly at the Religious Center. Interested parents
can call Joyce Schrader at 3246.
The help is out there but we parents have to be
willing to ask for it.
So, I ’m asking for your help: W hat issues are of
concern to you as parents (or grandparents or
teachers-in-the-m aking or child care givers)?
It’s im portant to connect with others so we can
feel heard, establish dialogue and exchange ideas.
If you have any thoughts on the subject, drop me a
line at the Alestle, or call me Monday, Wednesday
or Friday betw een 9:30 a.m. and noon (extension
3524).

Haiti to avoid a military invasion by
the United States.
The awards that Powell earned
while in the service include the
Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.
Powell was also knighted by Queen
Elizabeth for his role in the Gulf
War. He has also been awarded two
Presidential medals of freedom.
These days, despite Powell’s own
refusal to run for the presidency, he
serves on several boards of
trustees—and that number is
growing. Powell is, however, keeping
himself busy with book tours.
However, you get the feeling that
sometime in the near future, Powell
will have his eyes on the prize—the
presidency. Then Powell will be a
great citizen, soldier, and politician.
And for this, the Alestle salutes Colin
Powell.

Colin Powell
Captivating an audience, leading a
nation to victory in war and acting as
a symbol of hope for our country: all
these achievements can be identified
with Colin Powell.
Born in Harlem to Jamaican
immigrants, the young Powell went
on to survive the South Bronx and
enlisted in the U.S. Army where he
served for 35 dedicated years. Powell,
after surviving the Vietnam War,
became the youngest and first black
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
in 1989.
From here, Powell led the
combined forces to defeat Iraq in
1991 during Operation Desert Storm.
This victory brought back pride and
respect for the United States Armed
Forces.
After the war, Powell also served
in Somalia in a humanitarian effort.
Most recently, Powell, along with
former President Jimmy Carter and

E a g le s ' t a le n t to o m u c h f o r C o u g a r s to h a n d le
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor
The S IU E m en ’s basketball team
experienced a little deja vu Thursday night
when they hosted the defending division II
national champion, Southern Indiana.
In a game that was very similar to their
m eeting earlier this year, the Cougars fell 9584, dropping their record to 9-12 for the
season and 6-10 in the G reat Lakes Valley
Conference.
W ith the win, the Scream ing Eagles
moved to 19-3 (13-2), good for first in the
conference and sixth in the national polls.
“We had a great effort,” C ougar coach
Jack M argenthaler said after the game.
“Sometim es it just comes down to the talent
level.”
Talent is definitely one thing the Eagles
are not short on. Their lineup features last
year’s division II player of the year Stan
G ouard and four-time GLVC player of the
week, this season, Chad G ilbert. These two
stars played a m ajor role against the Cougars.
G ilbert, at 6-foot-9, showed that he is not
just a low post player. H e connected on six of
10 three point shots to lead the team with 20
points, as well as grabbing seven rebounds.
G ouard had a bad shooting night going,
just six of 17, but still tallied 14 points.
“G ouard is a very unselfish player. T h at’s
what m akes him so good,” M argenthaler
Jeremy Paschall/A/esf/e said. “A nd G ilbert had a great night from

Track team
travels to
Saluki Open
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
The C ougar track team
trav eled dow n to SIU C arbondale on Saturday to
com pete in the Saluki/USA
O pen and came back with
some high finishes.
O n the m en ’s side, Gus
C oronado took first place in
the 3000 m eter and 5000
m eter,
while
Travis
R o u n d co u n t also won two
races in the mile and 1000
m eter races.
The Cougars also received
a good run by Chris Wolf who
finished third in the mile with
a time of 4 m inutes and 26.52
seconds,
just
behind
team m ate R oundcount who
ran it in 4 m inutes and 23.48
seconds.
R ob Handshy finished 6th
in the 1000 m eter with a time
of 3 m inutes and 0.27 seconds
A nd D erek Bright took 7th in
the 600 m eter in 1 m inute and
31.95 seconds.
R ounding out the m en’s
field was Luke Lay, finishing
please see TRACK, page 13

D espite the perform ances of G ilbert and
G ouard, the Cougars were able to hang
tough for most o f the game.
Just like their m eeting earlier this season,
the Cougars played well for the first half, but
suffered a letdown in the final three minutes.
This time, the Cougars led 35-34 going into
the last three m inutes of the half, but USI
then put together a run sparked by good free
throw shooting, two G ilbert threes and, at the
half, they had grabbed a 10-point lead.
In the second half, the Cougars hung
around the whole time, but they were never
able to overcom e the deficit as Scott Boyden
scored 11 points in the half for USI on his
way to 17 in the game. H e joined Gilbert,
G ouard, M arc H ostetter and Neil Coyle in
double figures.
The Cougars were led by Jason Holmes
with a gam e high 27 points and eight
rebounds.
H olm es was follow ed in the scoring
colum n by R onnie H enderson and Chris
H arris at 15 apiece. Tim Thorsen, starting in
place of a sick N athan Kreke, played well on
his way to nine points.
The Cougars will now look to put the loss
behind when they travel to the blue grass of
K entucky for contests against N o rth ern
Kentucky and Bellarmine.
The Cougars lost to N orthern Kentucky
when they visited the Vadalabene Center, but
defeated B ellarm ine when they came to
town.

Freeland's shot lifts Eagles past Cougars
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter
It was expected to be a shoot out Thursday night when the
S IU E Lady Cougars basketball team took on Southern
Indiana, the third-place team in the G reat Lakes Valley
Conference. The game lived up to the high expectations.
H ead coach Wendy H edberg com m ented earlier in the week
on U S I’s trem endous am ount of talent. This includes p re­
season A ll-Am erican LeA nn Freeland.
N obody expected to see the two schools combine for 181
points. A n even bigger surprise was the way SIU E took the
highly rated USI Screaming Eagles to the limit. But H edberg
was right on the m oney when she m entioned Freeland.
The Cougars came up short in the final seconds as Freeland
h it ,a short ju m p er from the baseline with 5.6 seconds
rem aining to capture the game for the Eagles, 91-90.
A fast start gave USI a ten point .lead only four and a half
m inutes into the game, but the lead evaporated five minutes
later when SIU E capitalized on the visiting team ’s mistakes.
By half time, the USI lead had crept back to six points, but
H edberg retaliated by tightening up her defense.
“We didn’t want to give them many easy shots,” H edberg
said. “We w anted to box out well, get the boards and be patient
on offense.”
With 14:20 rem aining in the second half, the Lady Cougars
fought back to take a 64-63 lead. The up and down contest
ended with F reeland’s baseline shot.
S IU E had five players in double figures, including Terri
Evans with 24 points, Alicia H arkins who poured in 21, and
Am y Tuetken who netted 17. Leslie Phillips and Kim Lowe
rounded out the group with 12 and 11 points respectively.
“The kids played hard,” H edberg said. “We handled the
press really well. That was one of my biggest concerns after the
last game. It’s a heart breaker to lose those.”
W ith the loss, the Lady Cougars fall to a record of 14-8
overall and 9-7 in the GLVC.
S IU E will be in conference action again on Thursday when
they travel to N orthern Kentucky.

Kim Lowe of the Lady Cougars is pressured by Deb Pope of
USI. Lowe scored 11 points in the Cougars' 91 -90 loss.
