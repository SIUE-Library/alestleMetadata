South A frica’s first am bassador to the U nited States since
that country’s black-majority governm ent was established in
1994 came to SIU E yesterday, echoing M artin Luther King’s
message of change through nonviolent means.
Franklin A braham Sonn, a college president for 17 years,
said he felt at ease in front of the auditorium filled with college
students, staff and faculty.
“ I used to take myself seriously until I saw a message
someone had written next to the button on a hand dryer in a
washroom. ‘Push here for a one-m inute speech by President
Sonn.’ A fter that, 1 stopped taking myself so seriously,”
Sonn said.
But, the am bassador did become serious as he addressed the
crowd on the challenge of rebuilding South Africa through
political, social and economic justice.
M arlin L uther King and Stokely C arm ichael were
individuals that gave South Africans hope, but one white visitor
thirty years ago also gave promise. Senator R obert Kennedy
had gone to South Africa just after M andela was imprisoned,
Sonn said, and pledged U.S. support.
Sanctions and protests that w ere begun on university
campuses around the U nited States helped end apartheid.
“South Africa would still be under a totalitarian regime and
(Nelson) M andela would still be in jail,” Sonn said.
Forty-six years of apartheid ended April 27, 1994 when

S orority to h o st breast
cancer awareness lecture
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
D etecting b reast cancer, the second
leading cancer cause of d eath am ong
women, at its earliest stage is a key to
survival. The women of Sigma G am m a Rho
Sorority, Inc. want people to be aware of
that fact.
A lecture on breast cancer awareness will
be held this evening at 5 p.m. in the Missouri
Room of the University Center. Roseanne
Franke, a representative from the American
Cancer Society, will be the speaker.
“O ne in every eight fem ales can be
diagnosed with breast cancer. Performing
regular self-exam ination techniques and
early detection can be a life saver,” Jocelyn
Jackson, m em ber of Sigma Gam m a Rho,
said.
In 1994, breast cancer ranked second of

all cancer cases and third overall in cancer
deaths. Breast cancer ranked first as new
cases reported, and is the second leading
cause of death among cancer for women.
Only lung cancer was higher.

Doctors test breast cancer vaccine
on Oregon woman
PO R T LA N D , Ore. (A P) — An
O regon woman battling advanced
breast cancer was injected M onday with an experim ental vaccine that
researchers hope will eventually be used to prevent the disease. The new
drug was developed at the Earl A. Chiles Research Institute. M ary A nn
H arnsberger, 53, was first diagnosed in M arch, 1993. O n Monday, she
was given the first in a series of six injections during a session at
Providence Portland Medical Center. H arnsberger will receive five
m ore injections over the next four months.

International-------------------------------------Bank ombudsman finds assets of five holocaust victims in first search
Z U R IC H , Switzerland (A P) — Swiss banks have been able to give only
11,000 Swiss francs ($8,800) to the heirs of Holocaust victims after the
first nine m onths of searches, an investigator said Tuesday.
The World Jewish Congress, which has been campaigning for an
opening of the Swiss banks books for what it claimed would be $7 billion
in such assets, called the initial results “pathetic”.
H anspeter H aeni, the banks’ om budsman, said the figures “may seem
disappointing at first glance,” but he said it showed him that two
previous attem pts to return Jewish assets — in the late 1940s and in 1962
— were largely successful.
The assets were part of 38.7 million francs (then $32 million)
identified by the banks last January as unclaimed and possibly belonging
to victims of the Nazi regime.

Condoms on a key chain; why
not mace on a key chain too?
SIUC may be the party school, but surely SIU E is way ahead
on condom distribution and trend setting.
Currently, the UCB is using “Condom s on a Key C hain” as
prizes for winning four games of ping-pong (Alestle, Nov. 7). It
is to barf, but say hey, like Boy Scouts, people have to “Be
P repared.”
To be fair, may I suggest that the UCB also pass out “Mace
on a Key C hain” so our lovely coeds can protect themselves
from ping-pong playing studs who just happen to have a
condom handy?

letter to the editor.

America is going up in smoke
Marijuana should not be m ade legal in the U.S.
1 am writing this letter to address the issue
of legalizing m arijuana. Today’s society is
wrought with internal struggle concerning
drug abuse, and legalizing m arijuana will only
add to the problem .
I have h eard past justifications for
legalizing m arijuana such as it will reduce
drug wars, gang violence and drug smuggling.
Don't consider this idea for a second. First of
all, what will prevent the sales of m arijuana
from getting out of hand?
Throughout the N etherlands, for example,
m arijuana was openly sold and consum ed at
coffee shops. The results were disastrous, in
which the adolescent use of m arijuana tripled,
along with the flow of drugs from bordering
countries. A fter this increase of drug use, the
N etherlands ranked num ber one in Europe
for crime and assaults.
Articles have been w ritten suggesting that
the governm ent will be able to control the
sales of m arijuana. L et’s be realistic. Look
how well the governm ent has done with
controlling cigarette sales to m inors. We

3

continue to see m ore kids standing on the
street corners lighting up.
The surgeon general’s warning has done
little in deterring these youngsters, so how
will they be stopped from smoking m arijuana,
which is highly addictive?
Movies and advertisem ents are playing a
role in the issue as well. A night of enjoym ent
for some typical teens may be to buy some
weed, rent the movie “D azed and C onfused”
or even “ Up in Sm oke” with Cheech and
Chong, and get high along with the
characters. This is taking place all around us
and it’s not a laughing matter.
The drug problem here in the U.S. is
getting increasingly worse with m arijuana
leading the way. We have no better chance of
succeeding in the idea of legalizing m arijuana
than the E uropean countries did. Wake up
U.S.A., w e’re going up in smoke and it’s not
funny.

“ I was changing my

A feeling of the ‘boy who

way some students react to
both fire alarms and real fires.

I got up to warm up a
sandwich. The alarm went off
again, so I took my time. I’ve
got used to it,” Lakitia
Middlebrook, a freshman
majoring in special education,
said. “W hen the alarm s first
started, I was running out
in the cold in my pajamas.
Now with small fires in the
trash can, I take my time,
and p u t on my pajam as

M iddlebrook

day a large fire may occur.

The life of a diabetic:
By Rebecca Hopkins
For the Ales tie
After battling a weight problem most of her
life, Barbara was elated when she began
rapidly losing weight at the age of 34.
“It was a blessing to be able to eat all
the ice cream and other favorite foods I
wanted, and still lose two to three pounds
a week,” she said. “Until I found out 1 was
a diabetic.”
Dramatic weight loss is one of the first
symptoms of diabetes. Other symptoms
include increased thirst, excessive
urination, blurred vision, itchy skin and
slow healing of cuts and bruises.
B arbara’s family had a history of
diabetes and she was aware that being
overweight increased her chances to
develop the disease.
“My first reaction was,‘Oh s**t, I knew
this was going to happen,’ because my
family has a genetic tendency to diabetes,”
Barbara said. “Both grandmothers were
diabetic and a few years after mine was
found, my parents were both diagnosed as
diabetics,” she added.
At 50, Barbara has been living with her
illness for 16 years and agreed to detail
the progress of her diabetes provided her
last name not be used.
“Being a free-will-advocate child of the
‘60s, and then having to live by rules, was
very difficult,” Barbara said.
In the beginning, her doctor prescribed
a strict diet and an oral medication.
Although this is usually the first tactic
doctors use to control adult-onset
diabetes, it requires rigid adherence to a
diet and exercise program that few are
able to maintain. Barbara was not able to
control her blood sugar this way, and her
doctor switched her to self-injection

By Melissa Mills
For the Alestle
Diabetics, family members of diabetics and anyone who is just
interested about learning more about the disease are invited to
attend a diabetes education program on Saturday in the University
Center.
“We definitely want to do an educational program in
conjunction with National Diabetes Month,” Julie Langenbacher,
field representative of the Madison County C hapter of the
American Diabetes Association, said. “We are trying to raise the
level of knowledge and awareness of diabetes,” she added.
The chapter is sponsoring the program, which will be the first
diabetes education program for the newly established chapter.
According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes is
the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. The disease
affects over 16 million people in the United States.
“It’s very im portant that people take it seriously,”
Langenbacher said.
The conference is free and will be held from 8:30 a.m. until 2:30
p.m. on Saturday. Workshops on new medications, foot care,
nutrition/exercise and caring for diabetic children will be featured.
Those interested in the program or just interested in obtaining
more inform ation about diabetes can call 277-7116 or
314-968-3196.

“I was excited about the second half,” head coach Brian
K orbesm eyer said. “We created some quality chances that we
just d idn’t capitalize on.”
The Cougars lone goal came from Joan W acker 15 m inutes
into the game to tie the score at one. Stacy B undren assisted on
the goal.
Then, the final goal of the game came 10 m inutes later when
St. Joseph’s M ary Reid scored an unassisted goal to put them up
for good at 2-1.
The Cougars were trying to avenge St. Joseph’s for an earli­
er 3-1 regular season loss.
“We felt when we played them here that we didn’t play the
way we are capable o f playing,” K orbesm eyer said. “We
believed that we could do better.”
If everything goes right, the Cougars will get their chance to
redeem them selves next year.
“If the girls progress the way they should, then we should be
back in the sam e position next year,” K orbesm eyer said.
O ne reason why the Cougars should be b etter next year is
the am ount of experience the freshm en and sophom ores
received.
Since SIU E had only four seniors on its roster, the young
players were put to the test early.
“The freshm en exceeded all expectations. M egan Beagles
received freshm an of the year honors in the conference and the
o ther freshm en held their own,” K orbesm eyer said. “I ’m happy
with all the freshm en.”
Along with Beagles winning a post season award, Janece
Friederich won player of the year for the G reat Lakes Valley
C onference for h er 26 goals and 13 assists.
“Usually when a player has 26 goals they are just a shooter,
but she also had 13 assists,” K orbesm eyer said. “She doesn’t
know it, and probably w on’t adm it it, but she is a leader.” •

Belleville’s Christy Scheller has moved into

with 1,215.
M ontgom ery likes the C ougar’s chances in
the tournam ent because of the draw they
received from their No. 2 seeding.
“We are playing with a lot of confidence
right now,” M ontgom ery said. “If we continue
to play like we have been playing, we have a
legitim ate shot of winning it all, but we have
to be mentally prepared and we cannot over­
look anyone.”

Hey, Cougar Basketball fans, it’s
that time of year again. Time for another
exciting season of Cougar Basketball and
time for the Cougar Corner. Check the Corner
each week to find out who had outstanding per­
formances in their previous games. Both the
m en’s and w om en’s teams prove to be exciting to
watch. Come watch as Alicia Harkins and Beth Brown battle foes down
low. Amy Tuetken brings a balanced inside-outside game to the floor, as
do Cris Loomis and Leslie Phillips. Kim Lowe looks to fill in at guard
where standout Terri Evans left off.
On the m en’s side, Jason Holmes looks to lead the way. Come see the
sharp-shooter from New Castle as he needs only
303 points to be the all-time leading scorer in
school history. D on’t blink or you may miss
the tag-team at point guard Shaun Smoot
and newcomer Marlin Clark. Marvelous
M arvin led Southeastern C.C. with 77
steals last season. Smoot and Clark will
electrify the crowd with their quickness.
The Cougars also have something they
haven’t had in a while, size. Add the weight
of Tim T horsen and newcom ers Rusty
Sarnes and Travis Wallbaum and the Cougars
could put 680 lbs. on their front line. You better
bring it hard or don’t bother bringing it against
these guys.
As you can see, it will be an exciting year.
Jason Holmes
So check out the games at the Vadalabene
C enter then check the Cougar C orner for the inside scoop.
