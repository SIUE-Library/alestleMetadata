Fire alarm problem solved
Armed guards stationed at pull stations 24 hours a day 7 days a week
BY U.N. OWEN
SPECIAL TO THE ALESTLE
The Bored of Trusties has
decided to raise tuition to pay for
a new false-alarm prevention
system at SIUE.
“The rising number of false
alarms and their cost to the
university have made this step
necessary,” Chancellor David
Wormer said.
“We are sorry to have to take
such drastic steps and penalize so
many for the irresponsible
actions of a few,” he added.
The proposal calls for an
increase of $35 per credit hour
effective in the fall 2000
semester. The additional revenue
will go to pay hall monitors who
will be responsible for watching
areas where fire call boxes are
located.
The hall monitors will be
drawn from the ranks of parking
agents, according to Keith
Pennies, vice chancellor for
misinformation.
“These
hard-working
individuals are already used to
ratting out students. We believe

the transition to

Beanie hats for frosh Vendacard parking in works
BY BEA CRAZY
SPECIAL NEWS WRITER

BY O. R. THEY
NEWS CONIURER
If you are a freshman at
SIUE, you will be getting a new
fashion accessory compliments
of the university.
In an attempt to cure student
apathy, the university will now
require all incoming freshmen to
wear beanies.
Yes, beanies. Those cute
little hats that have been such a
part of college history are making
a comeback at SIUE.
“We thought it would be a
really groovy thing to do,” said
Lenny Lipshiitz, director of the
recently formed Student Feel
Good Committee. “I mean, gosh,
I think we have really hit on
something here. The students just
don’t seem to care about
anything. We on the SFGC think
this is just the answer.”
The beanies will be done in
red and white and have either a
bright yellow propeller on top or

pointless outline. It is here

a 6-inch yellow tassel.
Lipshiitz said the beanies
will be issued through the mail
and will only cost students $35 a
piece. For an extra $7, students
may get one with earflaps.
see BEANIES, you find it!

SIUE
officials
have
announced that the vendacard
system of payment will be
extended to other areas of fee
collection
due
to
the
overwhelming success of the
computer printing program.
The next area to be included
under the program will be
parking fees. Beginning next fall,
parking stickers will no longer be
required. Instead, vendacard
machines will be installed at the
entrance to each parking lot and
students will be required to use
their cards when exiting the lots.
Parking fees will be assessed
based on half-hour increments.
Any fraction of a half-hour will
be rounded upwards. The actual
fee has not yet been determined,
but will be announced prior to
fall registration.
In order to avoid confusion
with the computer printing
vendacards, parking vendacards
will be issued in a different color
and students will be required to
purchase parking vendacards

from
separate
vendacard
distribution machines. Those
machines will be located in the
lower level of Morris University
Center, on the third floor of the
library, and in the locker rooms in
the Vadalabene Fitness Center.
The machines will be operational
from 1 to 3 p.m. on alternating
Fridays.
According to Bobby Venda,
parking services director, parking
is a natural for the vendacard
program.
“Since
the
vendacard
machines are so conveniently
located throughout campus, we
think this will be a much easier
system of paying parking fees
than waiting in line once a year
during registration to pay for a
parking sticker,” Venda said.
“Students will be pleased with
the efficiency of the system.”
Students interviewed by the
Alestle about the new program
seemed anxious to give the
system a try.
Mack Sense, a junior
majoring in economics, said he
thinks the new system is a great
idea, and wishes the university

would have thought of it sooner.
“I’m excited just thinking
about all the time I’ll save,”
Sense said. “In the past, I’ve had
to wait in line for at least five
minutes or so when purchasing
my parking sticker each year.
This way I can just run down to
the
vendacard
distribution
machines every time my card
expires and it will only take a
second to buy a new card.”
Harriet
Hopeless,
a
spokesperson for the university,
said SIUE is proud of its
innovative program.
“There
are
no
other
programs like ours anywhere else
in the country,” Hopeless said.
“We are looking forward to
taking this to the next level. We
hope that within the next several
years the vendacard program will
be expanded into enough areas
that students will have cards in a
whole rainbow of colors for all
the services available on
campus.”
Hopeless said the next area
to be affected by the program will
be classroom admission.

“We found the that the
beanies
are
comparatively
priced,” he said. “They are
manufactured in Indonesia where
the child labor keeps the prices
down. Really, this isn’t any
different from other student
fees.”
Freshmen will be required to
wear the beanies while on the
main campus. To ensure that the
new policy will be enforced,
Parking Services will hire 10 new

staff members to patrol the
campus. They will administer
tickets of $15 to any freshman
not wearing the newest symbol of
school pride.
“This is a chance for the
students to share in something
great,” Lipshiitz said. “Imagine a
warm spring day on the quad,
students just hangin’ out in those
cute red and white hats, the little
propellers whirring in the
breeze.”

STULCE
from page 1

According to Stulce, after his
kidnappers had their fun with
him, they had to figure out a way
to get rid of him.
“They had a lot of really
cruel ideas,” said Stulce. “One of
them suggested making me recite
the Greek alphabet until I went
insane. Thank God they had
mercy on me and decided to
throw me in the lake. I would
rather drown than have to learn a

foreign language.”
Stulce said it was still dark
outside when they drove him to
Cougar Lake, tied a piece of rock
around his leg, and threw him in.
“They were laughing and
cheering thinking they had gotten
rid of me once and for all,” Stulce
said. “What they didn’t realize,
however, was the part of the lake
they threw me in was only two or
three feet deep. April fools.”

Campus cheating:
The internet makes cheating easier than ever
BY JENNIFER A. BOWEN
NEWS STRINGER

Internet is a constantly changing
and evolving medium verifying
cheating, or not cheating, can be
difficult. Should a student
plagiarize information from a
site, that site may not be available
at a later time making it difficult
to verify the theft. In the same
vein, a student who diligently
cites work taken from the Internet
may be suspected of plagiarism if
a professor attempts to find the
documented site and discovers it
no longer exists.

Students speak out
BY JOHN KLIMUT
ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR
Chancellor Werner spoke
with students in Cougar Den
yesterday.
In the second student issues
forum, in as many years, Werner
and various department heads
answered questions from the
student body.
Many
students
voiced
concerns about the new printing
policy on campus.
The policy mandates that all
printing from laser printers be
paid for on a per page basis.
Payment is made via the new
vendacard system.
Jay Starratt, of academic
computing, stated that printing
has never been free. According to
Starratt, academic computing
had been absorbing the costs of
printing since the introduction of
the laser printers. Until recently
printing costs were low enough
for academic computing to
subsidize.
However, the combination
of the laser printers and the
explosion of the popularity
explosion of the Internet
increased printing from what was

once a few hundred thousand
copies per year to well over 3
million prints per year.
The cost of subsidizing 3
million prints kept academic
computing from upgrading the
computers in the various labs.
A student asked about the
feasibility of using student IDs to
pay for printing.
Starratt confirmed that when
feasible, the student IDs will be
upgraded and will have the
capacity to pay for printing.
"As soon as we get the new
[software] release we'll go to the
student IDs," Starratt said. "They
[IDs] will be much easier for
everyone."
Mike Schultz, housing
director, addressed the recent
problem with fire alarms. "We've
noticed a pattern," Schultz said.
He believes that the false alarms
may be linked to attempts to
sneak visitors into the residence
halls.
Werner fielded a question
dealing with Madison County
Transit and the absence of
service on Sundays. Werner
promised to look into the
situation.

Supreme Court reviews fees
WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Supreme Court agreed Monday
to decide whether public
universities can use mandatory
student activity fees to subsidize
campus groups that pursue
political goals.
The justices said they will
review rulings that barred the
University of Wisconsin from
dipping into activity fees it
collects from every student to
finance such groups.
Advocates for gay rights
organizations
say
limiting
subsidies will hurt disfavored
groups nationwide. A decision is
expected next year.
A federal trial judge and an
appeals court ruled that the
subsidies unlawfully force some
students to subsidize views they
find objectionable and thereby
violate free speech rights.
The lower courts barred the
university from using fees
collected
from
objecting
students. Several law students
with conservative political views
challenged the funneling of

student activity money to 18
organizations on the Madison
campus.
The forced funding of such
organizations significantly adds
to the burdening of the students
free speech rights, a three-judge
panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled last year.
It said the university cannot
use the allocable portion of
objecting students’ mandatory
activity fees to fund those
organizations.
The appeals court panel’s
ruling did not shield objecting
students from paying any activity
fees but gave them an opt-out
privilege. They can identify the
political or ideological groups
they do not want to support and
have their fees reduced on a
prorated basis.
Among groups that were
objected to in the 1996 lawsuit
against the university were
Students
of
National
Organization
for
Women,
International
Socialist
Organization, Campus Lesbian,

Gay, Bisexual Center, and an
AIDS support network.
“We look to the Supreme
Court to stop this narrow-minded
assault on a neutral system for
supporting campus dialogue,”
said Patricia Logue of the
Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, a gay-rights
group.
In a friend-of-the-court brief
supporting
the
university’s
appeal, Lambdas lawyers had
argued that the appeals court
ruling confuses payments to
construct a stage with being
forced to speak upon it or fund an
organization that uses it.
The nation’s highest court
ruled in 1995 that public
universities and colleges cannot
set up a public forum for students
and then refuse to subsidize some
student groups because of their
viewpoint. That decision said the
University of Virginia wrongly
refused to subsidize a student-run
a Christian magazine.

Plagiarism is considered a
serious academic offense and can
result in permanent expulsion
from the university. Professors
usually handle plagiarism by
giving a student an E for the
course or an F on the assignment.
The first time an offense is
reported to the provost, the
student is put on academic
probation. A student found guilty
a second time will be suspended
from the university "for a period
of not less than one term." If a
student who had been suspended
for plagiarism is found guilty of
plagiarizing again, the student
will be permanently expelled.

Students plagiarize for
various
reasons:
parental
pressure to succeed, poor study
habits, lack of time or initiative
and poor time management. For
whatever reason a student
chooses to cheat, plagiarism
reported to the provost is
recorded
in the
student's
academic record and follows a
student into his career.
"I think plagiarism is a really
foolish thing to do. You take such
a chance with your career,"
Engelman said. "You're just not
helping yourself by trying to get
out of your responsibilities as a
student. You damage your
reputation and your future."

comedians, but we 're not going to quit our day jobs.

BY E.J. GALLO
The activity fee is a puzzle,
but students pay it without
question. The undergraduate
catalog says registration is
complete
when
tuition
requirements are met and the
activity fee is paid.
I asked the bursar’s office if
the activity fee functioned like a
debit where the card holder was
allotted a certain number of
activity hours. If so, how soon
did it get maxed-out and was
there a three-beep activity
warning?
I don’t think the bursar’s
office knew the answer because
people there straightened papers
and asked if I had my shots.
It is difficult to be precise
about the word activity unless we
know what it defines. So, we
may assume our activity fee does

not subsidize organ transplants
which, undeniably are activities.
We may not include flossing our
teeth for a percent of the fee.
Surely, lecturing a class is an
activity, and so is staying awake
during the lecture.
You see the problem. The
application of the fee is based on
the nature of the activity, and
unless we sort it out, how can we
assign a fee?
There is a plausible answer.
The activity fee is invested in the
departments of art, athletics and a
myriad of scholarly disciplines
that add joy and luster to life.
Consider the satisfaction for
artists who fine-tune their craft,
when musicians play no sour
notes, when thespians don’t fall
in to the orchestra pit and when
dancers don’t lose their tutus in

mid-leap.
The athletic department
would be a wise repository for
the athletic fee. After many hours
are invested in fitness training,
workouts and practice, brawn
and brain combine and the
contest is won. The enemy is
vanquished. Again, there is a
sense of satisfaction and promise.
The rest of us hope our
activity fee supports this pursuit
of excellence because we are the
observers, the appreciative
audience, the lumpy. Just don’t
ask us to jump aboard the
treadmill, lift a weight or observe
the sign, “Row faster, you’re
paying for it.”

Last week was Random Acts of Kindness week.
°on! f lle I’ve always appreciated that play on words. After all,
BQiton
far too often we hear random acts of violence; kindness
is a much better term. You need a week like that in places like this.
It’s the Midwest and sometimes courtesy can be unpredictable.
Common courtesy isn't consistent when you live in a place
where when it’s hot, people’s tempers seem to rise with the mercury
and when it’s cold, their civility plunges with the temperature. Much
like the argument whether St. Louis is a Southern, Northern or just
a Midwestern city, it’s hard to determine the level of courtesy
around here.
I’ve always had this theory that the warmer a place is yearround, the nicer the residents will be. You’d think cold weather
would bring people together out of the sheer necessity for body heat.
But that is never the case. The colder it is, the more withdrawn
people become. They retire into their own little shells of warmth.
On the other hand, the closer you get to the Equator, the
friendlier people seem to be. How can you be angry when the sun’s
shining and it’s 72 degrees outside year-round? You don’t worry
about seasonal depression in Hawaii.
When it’s warmer, all of a sudden everyone has more time.
People have time to notice the world around them. If your car breaks
down in Newport, Ark., at least seven cars are going to stop to see
what’s the problem. Then the drivers will probably help you fix your
car and send you on your way. If your car breaks down on Interstate
270 West, someone may stop, but the driver is probably just slowing
down to be nosy or give you an unpleasant gesture.
I developed my climate theory from my encounters with nonMidwesterners. People from Chicago, New York, Detroit and
Milwaukee seemed to go on and on about how friendly the people
are in places like Belleville and St. Louis. But when people from
Southern states like Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas came to the
Midwest, they described the bistate area as being a little frigid. My
Southern-rooted parents usually start having convulsions when they
hear people from up North describe my birthplace as a friendly,
warmhearted town. Friendliness is in the eye of the beholder.
Therefore as a Midwesterner raised by genteel Southerners, I’m
used to never saying anything to people and avoiding eye contact as
much as I am accustomed to people telling me their entire life story
while standing in line at Walgreens. But I often don’t expect help
from strangers.
One of the disadvantages of being short, out of shape, female
and a mass communications student is carrying camera equipment.
Every two weeks or so I have to lug half my body weight across
campus, onto a bus, off a bus and to my apartment. Then I must
repeat the action to return the equipment. Often I pass many people
all going the same place I’m going and they are all pretending not to
look. I don’t mind, though. 1 was the one who wanted to be a
journalist. I need the workout. It won’t kill me. But on Monday last
week when I left my camera equipment at home and had to miss
class to get it, one of my fellow students gave me a hand.
A neighbor in my building saw me trying to walk to the bus stop
and gave me a ride. Now this may be a little thing, but when you’re
late for class and you’re schlepping a ton of equipment it means
everything. And when kindness is sometimes hard to come by, it’s
good to see that many of my fellow students are still willing to help
each other, as they demonstrated last week.
I have both been that cold person who pretends they don’t see
someone who needs help and I’ve also been the warm person who
will jump through hoops for complete strangers.
After that random act of kindness, I’ll see if I can tap more into
my Southern side.

Productions, who are
known for their work with
the Rolling Stones and
Janet Jackson.
“Sevendust Live &
Loud” provides several
clips of insightful
interviews and behind-thescenes footage.
In one interview clip, drummer Morgan Rose
said, “If we (Sevendust) don’t feel nauseous or
completely spent after a show, we feel like we
cheated the fans that paid to get in there.”
Sevendust originally formed as Crawlspace in
1995 and recorded “My Ruin,” which was a standout
track on the “Mortal Kombat: More Kombat”
soundtrack. But the band members have known each
other for years, playing in a series of bands, including
Snake Nation (with members of Corrosion of
Conformity), Body and Soul, Still Reign and
Rumblefish. Guitarist Clint Lowery said, “Finally, we
just decided to put two words together and we came up
with Sevendust.”
Sevendust has passed through St. Louis several
times. Most recently, they graced the main stage at
Ozzfest ‘98 at Riverport Amphitheater. Before that,
Sevendust was the opening act for Clutch and Limp
Bizkit on the Cambodia Tour at Mississippi Nights.
Sevendust is preparing to spread their signature

If there’s ever been a reason to be home by
midnight on a Friday, it’s “Sevendust Live & Loud.”
At 12:35 a.m. Saturday, April 3, “Sevendust Live &
Loud” will air on KDNL 30 following the “Point Radio
Show.” The show is a recording of Sevendust
transforming Chicago’s Metro Theater into a surging
metallic revolution on Sept. 16, 1998.
As the show opened, the band was on stage playing
the intro music to “Black,” from their self-titled album.
Lajon (lead vocals) had to fight his way to the stage
through the growing madness of the explosive crowd
after the first riff began.
Lajon claimed his commanding presence on the
catwalk stage within close reach of frenzied fans
thrashing around him. Feeding off their intensity, Lajon
launched into his own violent display of unleashed
energy while his lengthy dreadlocks smacked the faces
of the ecstatic fans.
The crowd answered right back by catapulting each
other on top of the sea of bodies in chaotic, bodysurfing
endeavors. The camera engulfed in the mosh pit was
continuously slammed around.
The special will feature a total of six songs
including versions of “Speak,” “Too Close to Hate,”
“Bitch” and “Prayer.” “Sevendust Live & Loud” was
produced by award-winning Second Coming

BY COREY STULCE
WRITER AT LARGE

As you all well know, college students have little
money. Sure, part-time jobs help, but some of us
encounter extra expenses that we were unprepared for.
W hen I inherited that monkey farm from
“Kooky" Uncle Carl, I did not expect the
monkeys to be quite so wild.
Trust me, I should have stock in carpet
cleaners and Chiquita Bananas.
I already have a decent job at a bookstore, where I can pretend to
be intellectual. But I still needed some extra dough. For some
supplementary income, I decided to take on the position of “storyteller”
for the bookstore.
I thought to myself, “Who better than I to help these young minds
appreciate some of the fine literary classics available at rock-bottom
prices?” I was gonna make Jordy from “Star Trek” (and “Reading
Rainbow” fame) look like a hack.
It took a little while to get things rolling.
The first week of story time there was a costumed visitor for the
kids. It was Hugo the Hippo, who was there to promote his new book,
“Hugo has a Heart Attack.” OK. I can share the spotlight. Let Hugo
have his few minutes in the sun.
I began to read the tale to the 40 or so children who were there. But
every couple of pages, Hugo had the inclination to do a little dance
behind me or wave to the children. They were obviously distracted.
When I am reading a story, I demand attention. So I gave Hugo a
friendly poke in the chest with my elbow, to give him the hint to cool
his jets. Hugo apparently has to have the last word, so he pushed me in
the head. So naturally, I threw the book down and it was on. It was hard
to hear the children’s cries over the loud screaming of Hugo in a
headlock. Suffice to say, he won’t be returning to the store any time
soon.
The next week, I was reading some tropical stories to the children.
I decided to make the event a bit more interactive. I arrived in character
as Cap’n Corey, the Cursing Sailor, and brought in a bottle of Captain
Morgan’s so I could relax before the big event. I made a few pina
coladas, nonalcoholic for the kids under six, of course. I was amused,
and the children seemed to be having a good time. But there were a few
spoilsport parents in the audience. At least the tots left with an expanded
vocabulary. I told them to try to fit the word “sucker” into their daily
conversations as much as possible. I also suggested a few prefixes for
the word.
One week later, I was forced to read a book called “Everybody
Loves a Hug,” which I found to be revolting. I must admit I gave a
lackluster performance, but some little 5-year-old girl must have been
moved. After the story, she came over to give me a hug. Well, ever since
the “incident” (which I will not go into again, especially here), I have
this thing about not being touched. So I sent the little tyke reeling over
a couple shelves of books. Pure instinct. But I hear she’s now holding
down solid foods again, so all’s well.
Two weeks ago, I had a bizarre night. Some friends of mine made
pizza with some extra “mushrooms” on it. The next morning at story
time, I was still feeling a bit euphoric. Instead of reading books, I pulled
out a ukulele and started to sing selections from Pink Floyd’s “The
Wall.” The kids seemed to dig singing along to the “We don’t need no
education” part.
Last week, I was fed up. I was sick of reading stories about
alligators with toothaches or way too curious monkeys. In a secluded
corner of the store, I found some different books. I thought these books
would be far more educational for the children.
I read “It’s All Your Fault Mommy’s Gone” and “Even Some
Babies Can Be Ugly.” The kids were finally wide-eyed and attentive.
Next week's selections are “Daddy’s On the Drink Again” followed by
“You Were An Accident.”
Bring your kids by. The stories begin at 10 a.m.

Dear Krazi KittyThis is my fourth year at this school and I
am currently not dating. I ’ve been around
the block a few times so I pretty much know
how these guys work. I ’ve been in several
relationships at SIUE and everybody knows
my business. I recently fou n d out that I have
become infected with the H IV virus, and I
choose to keep this confidential. I d o n ’t tell
people who I ’m currently sleeping with
because the person that gave it to me d id n ’t
tell me. I kind o ffe e l like if people are real
easy to sleep with you and d o n ’t really know
you then they deserve what they get. I know
that might sound mean but it happened to
me. Do you think I will ever overcome this
hatred?

It seems that you not only have hate for the
person who infected you but a lot of hate for
yourself. For a little reminder, when you want
to keep something confidential you do not
write the school newspaper. Lucky for you there are quite a few people up
here that have also been around the block. I won’t name any names, but I
will watch my back. On a serious note, you need psychiatric help. You need
someone you can talk to about the virus and you need a lot of support. I
understand your anger, but remember you are not alone. There are several
support groups that you can go to and several people you can talk to, even at
SIUE. Keep in mind that we are entering a new millennium and you never
know, there might be a cure out there. I’m sure that you do know that Magic
Johnson has mysteriously made a full recovery. You never know, it could
happen to you. TIP: next time you decide to go around the block, use a
condom. Lifestyles are the best, so I’ve heard.
Krazi Kitty is a fast-talking, fashion diva full o f sass and class. As a Pi Psi Chi sorority
member, it’s her goal to spread advice to improve your otherwise drab and boring lives.
S he’s a professional player in the games o f love. She’s currently a mass comm major (after
10 degree changes) and a third year senior. She’s seen and done EVERYTHING on this
campus. So what do you want to know?

y4i the Xiooti...

fyitiiìx film qeUthe action wltiinq and keep* you*
BY DAVID TATUM
GRADUATE ASSISTANT
“Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels” is kind of a
combination between
“Trainspotting” and “The Full
Monty,” not because the film
itself resembles much from the
two movies, but because the
three of them are the most
successful films to come out of
Great Britain in the last few
years. They all combine British
(or Scottish) humor to explore
the lives of people whose dialect
is hard to understand but whose
motivations can still be
identified with.
This film is the debut for
writer/director Guy Ritchie and
takes place in squalid East End
London. The characters all speak
in a lingo called Cockney
Rhyming Slang, and since they

L a n e g a n 's

all also have thick accents, it is
often hard to understand what
they are saying or what is going
on.
There are
about 20
characters to keep
straight during the
film, which might
be difficult. There
are four main
characters, Eddie
the card player
and his friends
Bacon, Soap and
Tom. Sting plays
Eddie’s father in
the movie, but he
is the only face
most viewers will
recognize. The rest of the actors
are unknown.
Eddie gets involved in a
high-stakes poker game with the
much-feared pom king Hatchet

second

Harry, and ends up 500 thousand
pounds in the hole. If he doesn’t
pay up in a week, he and his

friends will start paying with
their fingers.
This is the starting premise
of the film, but there are many
twists and turns after that. There

m

is a lot of story packed into less
than two hours.
It might be useful to those
of you who
plan to see the
film to know
that firearms
are illegal in
England and
hard to come
by. One of the
funniest parts
of the film is
the scene
where the
marijuana
farmers try to
drive away the
bad guys by
shooting them
with a BB gun. Bad guys is a
relative term in this movie,
however, because the whole cast
is made up of criminals of one
sort or another.

i n ò

H iO Ü lV M j

Most of the time when a
film is full of stupid characters,
it is unbearable to watch. This
movie boasts characters whose
stupidity is quite entertaining.
The ads for the movie say they
are “a disgrace to criminals
everywhere,” but most real-life
criminals, besides the president,
are not this much fun to watch.
Instead of going to see the
new troubled-teen flick or
Sandra Bullock’s latest this
weekend, why not go to the
Tivoli and see “Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels?” While
the former pretend to have merit
but only display stupidity, the
latter revels in its stupidity to
produce a film of rare artistic
merit. You can either watch an
intelligent and unique English
film or take your chances
someplace else.

c o m in g ...

Former Screaming Trees lead man males a forward effort
BY DAVID TATUM
GRADUATE ASSISTANT
A lot of people enjoy music
that isn’t very popular or wellknown. There are the well-worn
CDs always at the top of the pile
at home that are listened to only
late in the night when no one
else is around, and prized like a
secret vice. Mark Lanegan is one
of these.
The Screaming Trees’ singer
has released three solo albums in
the last 10 years, but not many
people have them. Unknown to
most, he probably has the best
and most distinctive voice in
contemporary music today. His
album “Scraps at Midnight”
wasn’t up for any Grammys this
year, but there were no albums
half as good released last year.
The Trees formed 15 years
ago in Seattle. When the grunge
bandwagon rumbled out of town
years ago, the Trees got left
behind. They never sold millions
of albums or made piles of
money. They were not
glamorous, and their music was
just basic rock and roll, with no
techno drum beats or singing
choirs. The subject matter of the
songs wasn’t for everyone,
either.
Now while the Trees' future
is uncertain, Mark Lanegan
seems to have pieced his life
back together. He was a heroin
addict for years, and drugs
dominated his life and music. In
and out of jail a few times and
often in artistic paralysis,

Lanegan watched friends like
Kurt Cobain die. There was a
rumor that Lanegan ended up
selling everything he owned for
heroin and crack.
Today, clean and sober,
Lanegan told No Depression
magazine what a wonder it was
to still be alive, “It’s such a
surprise and shock to even be
present. I didn’t think I would
be. I was pretty sick. It’s been

18 years on and off for me, since
I was a kid ... And it’s misery.
And you just give up, give up. I
gave up a long time ago thinking
I would have some sort of
normal, substance-free
existence. So it was a big
surprise when I didn’t go.”
“Scraps at Midnight,”

Lanegan’s new album on Sub
Pop, sounds like a catharsis, a
letting go of one’s midnight
hours. It’s hard to decipher what
a lot of Lanegan’s songs actually
mean, but the ones on this album
feel like redemption. “Scraps” is
still as dark and moody as
Lanegan’s two previous solo
efforts, but under all the
melancholia is a single shred of
hope.

In the song “Hotel,”
Lanegan sings, “I don’t speak
the truth too much/ Hear the
roar, and the hush/ Of the cold
chill of time/ And I’m happy
murdering my mind.” It seems
like he’s lamenting the wasted
years of the past, not the present.
“Hospital Roll Call," the

album’s opening track, consists
of Lanegan singing the word
“sixteen” over and over like a
mantra as the music rattles along
like a Packard on a dust-covered
highway. Only Lanegan can sing
a number and make it sound
profound.
Lanegan’s voice is simply to
die for. It sounds like grainy
molasses being poured into a
dirty ashtray. A lot of bourbon

and broken dreams, not to
mention a million cigarettes,
created it. Better than any
howling guitar, Lanegan’s voice
is an amazing instrument.
The music on the album
serves to complement Lanegan’s
voice, not overpower it.
Saxophone, stand-up bass and

piano drift in and out of the mix,
but underneath it all are acoustic
guitars, sometimes three or four
distinct voices in a song,
strumming along like heartbeats.
Mike Johnson (the other
guy from Dinosaur Jr.),
produced the album. Every
album these two make together
sounds better than the last. This
one is a classic headphone
album, because the mellow
arrangements are so rich and
complex. It’s also great in the
car, when you’re driving along
in the early hours of the
morning, too tired to stop and
too restless to sleep.
The album only took two
weeks to record, but it sounds
like it took a year. Chris Jacobs
of Sub Pop said, “The only
reason I can come up with for
that is, with Mark, he’s a crazy
workaholic.” When asked
whether Lanegan smokes four
packs of Cigarettes a day, Jacobs
could only say, “He does smoke
a lot.”
If the countless cigarettes
and good music are Lanegan’s
only remaining vices, they sure
make for good music. When he
was crooning in years past about
Jesus knocking on his door, his
fear was beautiful, if there is
beauty in every song you write
possibly being your last. Now
that he is clean and sober, the
beauty of his music is hope, the
hope that maybe there is a
second chance for everyone.

UConn shocks the nation
BY CHAD BAALMAN
SPORTS REPORTER

BY TONY AMMANN
SPORTS EDITOR ■

Baseball
The St. Louis Cardinals
granted Carlos Baerga a golden
opportunity to resurrect his
career in St. Louis. Baerga
compiled gigantic offensive
seasons during his first three
years in Cleveland. When
everything seemed to be going
uphill for the young second
baseman, Baerga started to
gain weight. His carefer
plummeted
quicker
than
Vanilla Ice’s.
General manager Walt
Jocketty, needless to say,
w asn’t exactly encouraged
when Baerga seemed more
lethargic than ever and was cut
from the team.
Maybe
Baerga
was
brainwashed by the “Rosie
O ’Donnell Show” in the
afternoons. He may have said
to himself, “Hey, if she can
show up to work every day and
make millions for being
overweight and unproductive,
why can’t I?”
Now it’s time for Tony
LaRussa to choose a second
baseman from his roster. The
nominees for opening day
starter are: Pat Kelly, Plácido
Polanco, Joe McEwing and
Shawon
Dunston.
The
envelope, please, so it can be
tossed into a bonfire.

Hockey
Flyer’s superstar Eric
“c ry b a b y -c h e a p s h o t-a rtis t”
Lindros lived up to his name
well last week.
It really wasn’t surprising
to see Lindros stab an opposing
player in the face with his stick.
Besides, the skater had his back
turned, so what a great chance
to get even, right, Eric?
Most players
in the
National Hockey League have
that little boy still in them. That
boy’s first priority is to make
fancy maneuvers and score
goals for his girlfriend.
Eric has the little boy in
him, too. But it’s that little boy
who was bigger than everyone
who had no friends and would
run around on the playground
in first grade and steal your
soccer ball and kick it up on the
middle-school’s roof.

If you ask Jim Calhoun if
he’s shocked, you are wasting
your time.
“We’re a great basketball
team and we beat another great
basketball team, the best we
played all year, but we’re not
shocked,” said Calhoun, the
University
of
Connecticut
Huskies coach. “We truly
believed we could beat them. We
knew it would be a tremendous
challenge, but we knew we could
win.”
Of course, Calhoun is talking
about the National Collegiate
Athletic Association
men’s
national championship game
Monday, when his UConn
Huskies upset top-ranked Duke
University 77-74 at Tropicana
Field in St. Petersburg, Fla.
The majority of the media

and basketball public didn’t give
UConn much of a chance of
dethroning the Blue Devils.
Some even called it the “Duke
Invitational.”
After a sluggish 9-2 start, the
Huskies played with fire and
ferocity on defense and swagger
on offense. What better way to
fire up a talented Huskies team
than to tell them they don’t
belong.
With defensive specialist
Ricky
Moore
in
Trajan
Langdon’s face down the stretch
and Richard “Rip” Hamilton and
Khalid El-Amin hitting tough
shots in the game’s final minutes,
UConn
displayed
mental
toughness as the Huskies played
in their first-ever national
championship game.
Hamilton,
named
the
tournament’s Most Outstanding
Player, scored 27 points in the
title game. El-Amin scored his

team ’s final four points and
Moore chipped in 13 points in
addition to his defensive role.
“We worked really hard as a
team,” Moore said. “I wanted to
come out and prove myself. I
wanted to show I had an
offensive game, as well as a
defensive game.”
That he did. And UConn (342) also showed it had a superior
bench with the Huskie reserves
outscoring Duke’s more heralded
reserves.
“We lost to a great basketball
team,” Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski said. “We were
beaten tonight. We didn’t lose.”
Calhoun said, “We’re as
happy as heck, and we truly
believed we could beat them. I
said before the game that we
hadn’t played our best yet.”
While Krzyzewski came into
the game with the glossy Final
Four credentials and back-to-

back national titles in ‘91 and ‘92,
Calhoun was viewed as a
serviceable coach who could
never get to the big game, let
alone win it.
Calhoun showed he could
match wits with the game’s best.
He developed a game plan that
not only limited Duke’s inside
game (Elton Brand), but flustered
Langdon and point guard William
Avery. UConn held Duke’s
vaunted offense to less than 50
percent shooting.
Simply put, UConn was
better, though those on Tobacco
Road in Durham, N.C., will tell
you the Blue Devils would win
four out of five times.
But in the NCAA tournament
and March Madness, it’s one loss
and you’re out. There are no
mulligans in this sport.
So it doesn’t matter if they
said UConn couldn’t do it.
UConn did.

SIUE soccer team recruits new stars
BY CHRIS LAMB
SPORTS REPORTER
The SIUE men’s soccer team
recruited five new players who
will hopefully give the squad a
boost this upcoming season.
Cougar head coach Ed
Huneke
believes
these
newcomers will step in and fill
the holes left by the departing
seniors.
“We lost a lot of seniors, and
we need these new players to

contribute right away, which I’m
confident that they will.”
The Cougars signed Donny
Sheehan, a transfer student from
Eastern Illinois University, as
their new goalie.
Sheehan enters with two
years of eligibility left after
playing at Belleville Area
College for one season and
Eastern Illinois last season. As a
senior at O’Fallon High School
he was named first-team AllConference.

Matthew Horan, a back, and
forward Kevin Corrigan both
come from Christian Brothers
College H.S. Horan was a
second-team All-Conference as a
senior.
William Nunamaker is a
transfer student from the College
of DuPage. He was selected to
the second-team All-Region in
his two seasons of play there.
Nunamaker is expected to see
time at both the mid-field and
back positions.

Chris Camacho is expected
to be the Cougars biggest scoring
threat. Camacho, an All-State
selection his senior season,
totaled 57 goals and 23 assists
over his high school career.
Camacho was Quincy High
School’s Most Valuable Player
his senior season and led the team
in scoring in each of his final
three years.
With this group of talent the
Cougars hope to do some damage
in the GLVC Conference.

10.

Michael Jordan returns to baseball and signs a five-year, $80
million contract as the Cardinals' new second baseman. Jordan will
receive a $30 million bonus for each year that he hits o v er. 150. Jordan
receives a luxury suite, private jet and Mark McGwire’s 62nd home
run bat.
9 . Major League umpires are all demoted to umpire the Cougar
baseball games, and college umps are promoted to the majors. Cougar
head coach Gary Collins gets ejected from an National Collegiate
Athletic Association record 14 straight games due to arguments with
former American League umpire Don Denkinger— in all 14 games.
8 . The players of the National Basketball Association decide to go
back on strike because Cougar stars Antonio McKinzie and Travis
Wallbaum enter the draft and will dominate the league. The Lakers
break up in a big way. Kobe Bryant decides to go back to college and
get his degree at SIUE, Shaquille O’Neal becomes the first gospel
rapper and Dennis Rodman becomes a woman — permanently.
V . SIUE gets funds to bulldoze the science building and construct
a tax-free beach for the volleyball team to play on. However, the beach
gets cluttered up with beer cans and spray-painted rocks by Greekies
and is shut down by student government in three weeks. The
communications building is expanded in place of the beach.
6 . Eighteen fake fire alarms are set off on April Fools’ Day. The
Edwardsville Fire Department gets disgusted and sets a fire on the
tennis courts, puts it out and leaves. After investigation by the tennis
team, the players prove to the grand jury that members of the fire
department were setting off the false alarms. SIUE wins $10 million in
lawsuits and builds an air-conditioned, domed tennis stadium.
5 .
A member of the SIUE golf team is arrested for replacing
Southern Indiana’s Titleist golf balls with golf balls filled with
nitroglycerene. Bill Clinton steals the idea and uses the explosive balls
to drop on Kosovo.

4 . SIUE police are contacted after several male students are
accosted by female kick-boxing blackbelts shortly after an aerobics
class at the Vadalabene Center. “I never knew what hit me,” said one
of the battered students.
3 .
Cougar football team wins Great Lakes Valley Conference
Championship. After investigation by the NCAA Division-II Football
Committee, it was found that players from the SIUE team were
actually members of the softball team. The softball players picket on
the campus arguing for women’s rights and are given back their
championship trophy.
2 . A member of the SIUE hockey team, reportedly known as Dan
Kennedy, was practicing his slapshots in the SIUE parking lot and
accidentally strikes a Parking Service station wagon. The driver of the
station wagon loses control of the car and crashes into a parking meter.
Change spills from the meter, Kennedy gathers it up, buys 30 pounds
T)f sugar and pours it into every gas tank of every Parking Service
vehicle. The vehicles are out of order for six weeks, and employees
have to ride around on little tricycles trying to catch people who park
without stickers.

stay on the track at all times.

do a little dance as long as one member of your team is on the track and moving in some form,
everything is fine!
