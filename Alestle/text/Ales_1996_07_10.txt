TLA residents angry

some local calls to increase
B y D a r r y l H o w le t t
N e w s E d ito r

With MCT fresh in
the memories of many
SIUE students, another
problem has arisen
between students and
the university.
On July 5, the Office
of Information
Technology switched the
range for local calls for
Tower Lake and
Residence Hall
residents.
Some prefixes that
were previously toll-free
will now have a charge.
Since last Friday,
students have
bombarded student
government officials
about the abrupt change
in services.
“After the MCT
situation, I thought

communications would
have been better
between the university
and students. But now
this phone situation—
they bounced this one
right over our heads. I
don’t know what’s going
on,” Student VicePresident James Little
said.
Among those who
also received numerous
calls this weekend was
Student Body President
Christopher Nance.
“ I could tolerate
MCT because it was for
right now. The university
was paying about five
cents per Tower Lake
call and all of a sudden
it’s too much for the
university to pay, yet at
the same time the
university has increased
the phone range for

employers while
decreasing the range for
Tower Lake residents.”
Nance said he was
shocked and outraged
because he works closely
with the administration
to prevent
miscommunications like
this.
“ (There is) no
information as yet about
the entire situation,”
Nance continued. “This
was a disregard to
student government by
the administration. It
seems apparent that the'
university puts us on a
need-to-know basis.
Evidently we don’t need
to know much. This is
how they do business—
by leaving students in
the dark. Rent is going

SIUE implements parking and
traffic policy revisions
B y T y N o r r is
N e w s R e p o r te r

In order to enhance parking and traffic revenue so that decal rate increases could be
kept as low as possible, the University Parking and Traffic Committee have recommended
and received approvals to revise certain policies.
Ken Neher, Vice Chancellor for Administration, approved the revisions which are in
addition to those contained in the parking and traffic regulations handbook handed out
with decals.
“The additional revenue received from these policy changes will permit us to keep
decal fees as low as possible,” Neher stated in a memo to the university community.
The Parking and Traffic Regulations booklet states that SIU E is planning improvements
to the parking facilities as well as enhancements to exterior lighting and emergency
telephone systems. Revenue from parking and traffic operations is the sole support of this
effort.
“The revisions were proposed to make it fair for everyone,” Carolyn Turner, Campus
Parking Manager, said.
Meter rates will go up, as well as the cost of the first two hours in Lot B. Temporary
disability permits will be available for Lot B at no charge, but a fee of $35 will be assessed
for a 30-day permit to park in the metered lot (Lot C) behind Rendleman.
The calculation of Lot B Guest Passes will change from a flat fee of $1 a day to half the
actual cost up to a maximum of $3.50 per day.
Service permits will no longer be honored at meters or in the tunnel joining Rendleman
and the University Center.
There is a ray of hope.
According to Turner, motorists will still not have to feed the meters in Lot A (behind
Lovejoy Library) after 8 p.m. Lots 1, 2 and 3 (faculty and staff lots) will also remain open
to any decal after 4 p.m. and the Vadalabene Center has open parking after 3 p.m.
In addition, free parking is still available at the lot by the stadiums.
Some changes have been in effect since July 1. Other changes at the Edwardsville and
East St. Louis campuses will go into effect August 19 and August 5 for the Alton campus.

What the parking revisions mean
• No open parking between breaks
• Meter rates and first two hours in Lot B
will be .75/hour
• 30-minute limit in Art and Design Lot
» Multi-vehicle medallions must be
displayed
• Transportation Services must purchase
blue decals
• Temporary disability permits no longer
honored at meters; those with
temporary disabilities may park in Lot B

NAACP angry at
Dole’s absence

Camper, garage destroyed by fire

CHARLOTTE, N.C.—Four years
ago, then President Bush declined an invitation to speak at the
NAACP’s annual convention. Feeling deserted by the Republican
Party, members are frustrated that Bob Dole is passing them by this
year, too.
“If he wants the support from blacks—Republicans and even
Democrats—he’s got to show, regardless of how he feels,” said Sid
Nelson, an NAACP member from Charleston, S.C., who is black and
votes Republican.
President Clinton planned to address the NAACP gathering on
Wednesday. The NAACP invited Dole to speak today but a
campaign statement issued late in the day said a “major scheduling
conflict” forced him to decline the invitation.

COLLINSVILLE—A recreational vehicle and a garage
were destroyed Friday morning by a fire that was caused
by careless smoking.
The Troy Fire Department was called in to help
Collinsville fire-fighters at 463 Lumaghi Heights Road.
The fire was started accidentally about 1:20 a.m. by a
relative who left after smoking cigarettes in the camper.
The fire then extended to the garage. Firefighters were
able to contain the blaze, saving the home.
A passing motorist woke up the homeowner to alert him
to the fire. Nobody was injured.

Clinton touts plan to trace seized guns

CORRECTION

WASHINGTON—President Clinton announced a program Monday
to trace guns confiscated from teen-agers back to their original
sellers, the latest step in his election-year effort against juvenile
crime.
Republicans called Clinton’s plan a' rehash of a proposal put forth
by his own administration in November 1993 and accused Clinton of
bringing it up again as a campaign ploy.
Clinton announced a 17-city program, including St. Louis, to trace
guns by computer so that local police and prosecutors can find the
dealers who illegally sold them to children.
Clinton’s announcement came two days after Dole advocated
charging juveniles as adults for serious crimes.

Letter to the ed ito r_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Defense of Marriage act should be called Defense of Bigotry Act
One would think that in a healthy,
functioning democracy a time of
election would bring about a more
inspired, insightful and coureous
debate. After all, this is the time when
national leaders are offering up their
visions of where and how the country
should move forward. One would
think so, but one would be wrong.
Instead of courage, the Presidential
debate has shown an impotent
cowardice that seeks to deflect the
American people’s attention away
from the real issues of the day and
replace them with scape-goating and
“National Inquirer-like” allegations.
This has been the case this election
season with regard to the struggle for
civil rights for gay and lesbian
American citizens.
Both major parties’ Presidential
candidates have succumbed to the
radical right’s attack on the basic rights
of gay and lesbian citizens. A major
focus of this attack has been the socalled “ D efense of M arriage A ct”
which would set in law a limitation that
marriage can only exist between a man
and a women. This comes on the heels
of the state of Hawaii’s debate, and
likely pending passage, of same-sex
marriages. Conservatives fear that gay
and lebsbian couples would flock to
the state to be married and then return
home, forcing their state of residence
to acknowledge the union, thereby
effectively legalizing same sex
marriages in all fifty states.
Both Clinton and Dole have said

^

they oppose such an event and have
pledged their support for the “Defense
of Marriage Act.” President Clinton
has said he will sign the Bill when it
reaches his desk. This D efense of
Bigotry Act, as it should be called, is
simply un-American. It has been
decried by not only gays, lesbians and
progressives, but also by civil
libertarians who span the entire
political spectrum from left to right.
Seeded deep inside this legislation
lurks a hidden, more evil agenda— the
elmination of basic democratic rights
for gays and lesbians.
Conservatives often use the
argument that they are not against
gays and lesbians having full
constitutional rights, but that they are
against them receiving “special rights.”
A group of southern Baptists have
recently used this argument when
threatning
the
Walt
Disney
Corporation with a boycott in a year’s
time if they do not stop giving gays and
lesbians “special rights and treatment”'
at their facilities. What are these
“special rights” the Baptists and the
right-wingers are so upset about? It
turns out that they oppose giving the
domestic partners of gays and lesbians
the same company benefits that the
domestic partners of heterosexuals
receive. Currently, Disney has the very
commendable
policy
of
not
discriminating between the two. They
also oppose making it illegal to fire
someone simply because they are gay.
Their opposition to same sex

marriages also means that they oppose
the partners of gay and lesbian citizens
from receiving the same legal benefits
(such as government benefits,
insurance, etc.) that all other citizens
are entitled to. These are blatantly
unconstitutional
proposals
and
policies and we should not stand for
them. I can not be fired for being a
socialist, or a midwesterner, or a
conservative, or a pacifist, but I could
be for being gay. Thus, this is a struggle
for civil rights, not special rights.
Another argument used by the right
is that homosexuality goes against the
Bible. This has got to be the most unChristian attitude of them all. One can
also find passages in the Bible
condemning drukenness, prostitution
and leprosy, however, Christ is
described as hanging out with these
very people during his time on Earth
in order to show solidarity with the
suffering of the world. If Christ hung
out with drunks, prositutes and lepers
in th'ose days because they were the
suffering masses, then he would surely
find companionship these days with
the suffering of gays and lesbians and
the other oppressed minorities of the
world (not to mention a few socialists
as well). In fact, Christ also opposed
the death penalty as evidenced by
M atthew 5:38-9. M aybe Dole and
Clinton should favor cutting benefits
to death penalty supporters-of course
that would mean them since they both
support it! The truth is there are lots of
things forbidden in the Bible that we

tolerate in civil society. Maybe we
should cut off all government benefits
to adulterers. Hey! Wouldn’t that solve
the budget crisis!!
The troubles of America are not
caused by homosexuals and will not be
resolved by their unconstitutional
repression. Ours is not a healthy,
functioning democracy. It is sick on
unrestrained capitalism. If we want to
face up to the task of fixing what is
wrong in our society we must replace
the guiding forces of greed and
hierarchy with cooperation and
equality.
Legalizing
same
sex
marriages as well as adoption for gay
and lesbian couples would go a long
way towards these ends. What is good
for one is good for all.
I am married. Every day that I as a
heterosexual can be legally married
and a homosexual cannot is a day my
own union with the person I love is
devalued. I won’t stand for it, my
country shouldn’t stand for it, and
despite what Pat Robertson and Jesse
Helms might tell you, Christ would not
stand for it. How can it be wrong to
love another in a world so lacking in
love? Hate is the real crime.

up and services are going down,” Nance said.
A memo was sent on July 8 to all Tower Lake residents informing them of the changes that
had taken place and an apology from University Housing Director Michael Schultz for the
miscommunications between OIT, University Housing and students.
“There was poor communications between myself and Telecommunications about how
students would be informed about the changes in the phone services,” Schultz said.
The memo also provided a brief history as to why changes in the phone service occurred.
It stated that prior to 1991, all Tower Lake residents were only permitted local access to the
city of Edwardsville and Collinsville north of 1-70. At the request of students, the University
extended the wide-calling area for residential students effective July 1, 1991. At that time,
Ameritech did not charge Metro-East customers for each local call a customer made. But in
1992, Ameritech switched to charging for every phone call that is made by a customer.
In a recent audit finding, the University discovered that local calls made by students were
exceeding the amount students pay through their leases for telephone services.
Schultz also said that calls that would remain local are those in and around the East St.
Louis and Alton campuses.
Some students see the changes in the phone services as another one of the university’s
attempts to make changes without the students’ knowledge.
“ Now I can’t call my beautician. I can’t call places like Fairview Heights to check the times
for movies and such. They’re (the university) going through all of these changes during the
summer when it’s easier. When students come back this fall they’re gonna be upset,” Toskey
Marshall, a junior majoring in Management Informational Systems, said.
Another student, Yvonne Afriyie, a junior majoring in nursing, said, “ I think it’s not fair.
Being able to call around locally was one of the good things about SIU E. Now, students might
not even want to go here.”
“Right now, student government will be looking for as much information as possible before
making a decision, (regarding miscommunication with the university),” Nance said.
It is not yet known whether or not OIT will make more changes in the future to the newly
implemented phone services.
List 0/ phone exchanges (besides 800 and 911) that will be considered free phone
calls and that will not require long distance charges:

Last place Phillies host All-Star game
Philadelphia’s baseball fans, enthusiasm for the game doesn’t seem to
correspond to its place as one o f the summer’s premier sporting events
PHILADELPHIA (AP)

Even though he’s a Phillies season ticket holder,
Avery Goldstein gave away his tickets for Tuesday AllStar game at Veterans Stadium.
" I found someone else that wanted to go
more than I do,” Goldstein said.
All 62,000 seats at the Vet have been
sold for the game, and scalpers are
getting considerably more than the $65
and $50 face values on the tickets. But
among Philadelphia’s baseball fans,
enthusiasm for the game doesn’t seem
to correspond to its place as one of the
summer’s premier sporting events.
Maybe it’s the recurring stories of
churlish behavior by some of the game’s stars, most
notably Albert Belle. Maybe it’s a carryover from the
232-day strike and other labor squabbles that' have
plagued the game over the past 20 years.
Or maybe it’s simply the fact that the hometown team

“What they’re saying is, We still
love the Phillies but because you
don’t have enough good players
right now we don’t pay to come
out and see you,”

,

,

Phillies owner Bill Giles
hasn’t done much on the field lately to generate interest
in the sport.
The Phillies went from last in the NL East in 1992 to
first and an NL pennant during the magical summer of
1993. The team featured such characters as the wildthrowing Mitch Williams and the portly, wise-cracking
John Kruk, and Philadelphia was captivated.
Since then, the fighting Phils have free-fallen. In 1994,
injuries ended any chance of an encore before the strike
canceled the season.
Last year and this year, the problem has been injuries
and a weak farm system that couldn’t replace lost stars
like Lenny Dykstra, out with a bad back, and Darren
Daulton, out with bad knees.
With the Phillies stuck in the NL cellar, attendance has
dropped more than 7,000 fans a game from last year,
although the Phillies did discount tickets for the first
nine games last season as a post-strike goodwill gesture.
Owner Bill Giles admits having the All-Star game

hasn’t turned out the way he envisioned it would when he
began preparing the city’s bid in 1993.
"I t definitely takes a little excitement out of the game
when you only have one representative (pitcher Ricky
Bottalico) and you don’t have any regular players on the
team,” he said. "O f course, we kind of figured
Dykstra and Daulton would be on the team, but
it wasn’t to be.”
A week before the All-Star game, the
stadium was only one-third full for a
game against traditional rival New York,
and Philadelphia fans were finding it
hard to muster any fervor for baseball or
its annual summer showcase.
" I ’ve been a Phillies fan since 1960, and
this is one of the two or three worst years
they’ve had,” said Goldstein, 42. " I t ’s killed
all enthusiasm, All-Star game or no All-Star game.”
That sentiment is repeated by callers to radio talk shows.
"This is my seventh baseball season in town, and this is
the least interest I’ve seen in the game in Philadelphia,”
said Jody McDonald, a host on WIP. "Coming from a
baseball town like New York, this is the least I’ve ever
seen at any time in my 30 years as a baseball fan.”
Giles disagreed, saying the Phillies have taken " a lot of
surveys in the past six weeks” to get the pulse of the
citizenry, and it’s not that bleak.
"W hat they’re saying is, 'We still love the Phillies, but
because you don’t have enough good players right now,
we don’t pay to come out and see you,” Giles said. "But
as soon as you’re good again, we’ll be there.’”
That’s why the Phillies hope to fast-track some of their
young farmhands — third baseman Scott Rolen,
outfielder Wendell Magee, pitchers Carlton Loewer, Matt

"I’ve been a Phillies fan since 1960,
and this is one of the two or three
worst years they’ve had,”
Ticker holder Avery Goldstein
Beech and Ryan Nye — and hope they will blossom at the
major-league level in 1997.
But that’s next year. Right now, given the state of the
Phillies, the All-Star game and its surrounding activities
are easily the highlight of the baseball season in
Philadelphia.
"How can’t you want to go and see the best in the
world?” asked Bill Kravitz, 51. " I t ’s once in a lifetime.”
