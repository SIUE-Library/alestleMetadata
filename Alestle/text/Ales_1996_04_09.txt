Academ.c Affa.rs Dav.d Werner.

Larson was presented with a t-shirt, a “We A ppreciate You”

junior until he discovered that the residents of Cairo, Ga.. have even bigger hearts.
Thursby, 18, was chosen to represent his region in a statewide plumbing contest.
The only problem: he's required to wear work boots and finding ones that fit was
proving to be difficult. He couldn’t find any at area stores and didn't have the money
for a custom pair.
Hearing of his plight, the teachers at Cairo High School set up a footwear fund for
Thursby in late March. By early April, people from the community had donated
about $450. O f that. $339 will buy custom-made work boots. The rest will go for a
work shirt and pants and to help pay for the trip to A tlanta in May.

letter to the editor.

America is not
as bad as
people would
have us believe
I norm ally do not have the time to write letters to the
editor, but when I read the recent editorial by Michael W.
Flota, I was com pelled to respond. I am sick of hearing how
bad it is in Am erica. I constantly hear that “The rich are
getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.”
The U.S. Census B ureau has found that Sixty percent of
A m erica’s “p o o r” have air conditioning. 64 percent own
their car, 56 own microwave ovens and 91 percent of
A m ericans own a television. So why is everybody
complaining? Because of people who preach fear such as
Michael Flota, the citizens of this great country are very
afraid. Although the citizens of this country have m ore than
anyone else in the entire world, they are scared of what the
future holds.
Michael Flota is completely incorrect when he says, the
rise of autom ation will lead to high unem ploym ent. If this
were true, then unem ploym ent would have been steadily
increasing since the industrial revolution began many years
ago. He fails to realize that it takes hum an beings to operate
machines.
F lota is also w rong w hen he states, “ The rise in
autom ation has been the fuel behind the shift to leaner
corporations, which m eans less jobs.” M ichael does not
consider the normal turnover in a free economy. He must
realize th at as consum ption dem ands change, som e
companies will be forced to m ake cutbacks while others
spring up.
M ichael F lo ta’s solution to this “problem ” is ridiculous.
H e proposes th at each A m erican citizen should be
guaranteed a certain level of income. Why should this be?
Some people do not provide a good service to others, and
therefore should not be com pensated with money. I would
ask Mr. Flota where this “guaranteed annual incom e” will
come from? Let me guess, m ore taxes. That is a great idea.
We need an even bigger governm ent to take away m ore of
our liberties.
If A m erica is to rem ain the economic powerhouse that it
is today, we need to put the em phasis on what m akes this
country so great— The A m erican people, not Uncle Sam.
Politicians should work to give us the freedom to spend our
m oney as we choose by reducing taxes and regulations. Ask
yourself this question: D o you want to have m ore freedom
and control over your own lives or would you like to be
controlled by the W ashington Police?” It is a pretty simple
choice.

C h ild r e n 's c o d e p u z z lin g
C o lo r a d o

(A P)— You don’t have to go to Jordan, M ont., to find suspicion and paranoia.
Come to the C olorado Legislature and listen to the children’s code debate.
The House and Senate are struggling with the puzzle the children’s code has become because
of new amendments.
For m ore than a year, education and court and social services experts and parents worked to
m odernize and update the code, which was drafted several decades ago to adm inister justice to
juvenile offenders and deal with abuse and adoption, parental responsibility and hom e life.
They worked hard, and their product was generally praised.
But there is a segment of the population that thinks governm ent is a large, secret organization,
invidious and insidious, that will brainwash your children, turn them into liberal D em ocrats and
put you in jail for complaining about it.
They believe the New World O rder has taken over schools; the Illuminati dom inates most
churches and foreign governments; the U nited Nations is an invention of the devil; banks are
controlled by “those people;” even the military is corrupt and if you d on’t buy guns and bury
them som ewhere in the hills, and stash gold coins for when the financial system collapses, and if
you can’t start a fire with two sticks, recognize Russian tanks, learn to dry and preserve food and
convert com m on horse m anure into gasoline, yo u ’re gonna be real sorry.
They believe you should be able to teach your kids anything you want at hom e and not have
it contradicted in the schools, and that you should be able to whack your kids, even if they bruise
or bleed, and not have nosey social workers or doctors or teachers horning in if they suspect
abuse.
All that arose during hearings on the code.
Com m ittee rooms were jam m ed. Some spectators, when they w eren’t wringing their hands in
distress, raised them aloft and prayed aloud.
O n Monday, before floor work started on either bill, the State Suprem e C ourt approved the
title of a proposed am endm ent to the State C onstitution for a parental rights am endm ent that
could be on the ballot in November.
The am endm ent would create “an inalienable right of parents to control the upbringing,
education, values and discipline of their children.”
A reasonable person would presum e parents already enjoy and practice that right and there
is no reason to have it set out in the Constitution.
Coincidentally, during C hildren’s Code debate on the H ouse floor, an am endm ent was
approved, which said: “the right of parents to direct the upbringing, education, discipline and
values of their children shall not be infringed.”
It was by Rep. Doug Lam born, R-Colorado Springs, who said it was nothing m ore than a
statem ent that parents and not governm ent have the final say over the way their children are
treated.
But lawyers who examined the am endm ent said they w ere concerned it would som ehow be
used by religious-political extremists to challenge what schools teach; what social w orkers do;
what doctors and teachers report.
Tom Tancredo, a form er regional representative for the federal D epartm ent of Education and
anti-secular humanism conservative who works for the Independence Institute, defended the
petition drive and the infringem ent language.
He characterized the constitutional am endm ent as nothing of concern. He said it simply says
parents have a right to control the upbringing of their children.
“Bingo. T hat’s it,” he said.

House and Senate seek to ban partial birth abortions
No doctor should perform abortion unless woman's life is at jeopardy
(A P)— A bortion is legal. But there is one abortion procedure that should not
be.
The procedure, the so-called partial birth abortion, perform ed after about 20
weeks of pregnancy, is so heinous that, unless there is absolutely no other option
to save a w om an’s life, no doctor should be allowed to perform it.
A bill passed by both the H ouse and Senate rightly seeks to ban the
procedure. U nfortunately, the bill comes up short. W here it is specific, it may not

be medically proper, and where it is vague, it may be on shaky constitutional
ground.
Specifically, the bill would ban the third-term procedure “except where such
an abortion is necessary to save the life of a m other endangered by a physical
disorder, illness, or injury provided no o ther medical procedure would suffice.”
Pregnancy itself, in some cases, puts a w om an’s life at risk, and it doesn’t fall
under any of the categories listed as endangering the.m other.

Woman claims she was denied tenure because she is a lesbian
DAYTON, O hio (A P)—A form er assistant
professor of religion claims that W right State
University denied her tenure in part because she is a
lesbian.
Katherine Dvorak contends in a lawsuit that her
superiors discriminated against her because of her race,
sex, religion and sexual orientation. She claims they
“created an intimidating, hostile and offensive work
environment.”
Dvorak filed the lawsuit on Friday in U.S. District
Court. She is seeking reinstatement, back pay and
unspecified monetary damages.
Wright State spokesman Barry Johnson said it is the
university’s policy not to comment on lawsuits.

Dvorak said she first ran into trouble in 1991 after
her supervisors received a letter, accusing her of having
a homosexual relationship with a student.
She said one supervisor told her she would be fired
if the allegations were true, and another said such a
relationship would demonstrate bad judgment that
could keep her from getting tenure.
Dvorak said that the faculty members who engaged
in heterosexual relationships with students were not
threatened with termination or similar retribution.
The lawsuit said the student was not in any of
Dvorak’s classes.
Dvorak, who is white, specialized in the study of
black religions. H er suit also claims that a black female

colleague told her in 1988 that “Caucasian researchers
who study African American history only exploit
African Americans to benefit their own careers.”
She said the colleague lobbied to get her fired
because of her sexual orientation and area of study.
Dvorak said that when she was hired in 1988. she
was told that she had u n til. 1994 to either achieve
tenure or be terminated.
She was denied tenure in 1992. A committee from
the College of Liberal A rts recommended her for
tenure in 1994, but a university-wide committee of
faculty overruled it, and Wright State President Harley
Flack declined
to override
the no-tenure
recommendation, according to the lawsuit.

AT E D WARDS VILLE

PITTSB U R G , Kan. (A P)— On a broken,
cobblestone street just a block from the
Pittsburg State University campus, a scene all
too common in big cities m ade an unexpected
appearance in rural America:
Yellow crime-scene tape was draped from
an ap artm en t door to orange cones
surrounding the front of the house. Bunches of
flowers w ithered by the cold w ere strewn on
the d irt yard. A police car idled in the
driveway.
C arrie Williams, a 20-year-old junior from
Parsons, was found dead in this building just a
week ago, and the sheriff said her neighbor—a
40-year-old parolee and fellow Pittsburg State
student has confessed to her slaying.
The neighbor, G ary Kleypas, was charged
F riday with num erous counts: first-degree
m urder, rape, criminal sodomy, aggravated
robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary and
theft.
P ittsb u rg ’s first hom icide this y ear has
shaken the com m unity of 20,000, whose
residents boast they can still be affected by
violence at a time when much of the nation has
becom e jaded and desensitized.
Yet because many still believe that with
rural surroundings comes security, officials
fear the shock of Williams’ m urder will not last
long enough.
“A t PSU, people will be cautious for the next
six months. Then it will be gone,” said R obert
Ratzlaff, vice president of academ ic affairs.
“W e’re going to have to say to ourselves, ‘Just
because we live in a rural society doesn’t m ean
it’s a safe society.’”
F or those who have lived here much of their
lives, the message is heard but often not
heeded.
“I haven’t felt scared to live here. I lived in
Kansas City too long to be scared here,” said
87-year-old Agnes Biederm an, who moved to
Pittsburg in 1971.
“Pittsburg is growing. B ut we still have that
small-town quality,” police Sgt. Tim Tompkins
said. “Thank God we can still be shocked. As
a nation, everyone is getting a little bit more
desensitized. We’re still small and these things
still shock us.”
The town suffered through a similar tragedy
in 1993, when another Pittsburg State student
was killed by an ex-convict.
D onald R ay G ideon, w ho had been
conditionally released from prison for an
earlier rape, pleaded guilty to first-degree
m urder, rape and other charges in the death of
S tephanie Schm idt. H e was senten ced to
almost 100 years behind bars.
O utrage at her death turned to a push for
m ore safety measures. A free escort service
was established so anyone walking the campus
alone at night could call volunteers for
protection, the idea being safety in numbers.
A nd the university m ade plans to add m ore
lights.

Just two years later, the campus is brighter
but the escort service has been disbanded due
to lack of interest.
T om pkins
said
th at
attitu d e
is
representative of a problem he tries to combat
with education.
“A fter the shock wears off and life returns
to some type of normalcy, people start relaxing
again and pretty soon it’s back to business as
usual,” he said.
T he university was m aking plans to
rein state th e escort service and install
em ergency phones around campus, said Jim
Taylor, vice president of student affairs. He
also hoped the school could find a way to
equip each of its 6,400 students with cell
phones program m ed only for 911 or escorts.
T aylor said he did not believe C arrie
W illiams’ killing would hurt enrollm ent.
Suspect Kleypas was on track to graduate
with a nursing degree this year and had taken
nutrition classes in the sam e building where
Williams had h er fashion design courses. They
did not have class together, said Sue Unger,
head of Family and C onsum er Sciences.
T he nursing d ep a rtm en t has refused
com m ent.
“T he nursing students are m ost upset about
this,” R atzlaff said. “Some of them actually
thought he was a very polite, nice person and
w ere alm ost horrified w hen they saw pictures
of him in chains having his first hearing.”
A cquaintances o f Kleypas, paroled from
Missouri after serving half of a 30-year term
for second-degree murder, w ondered how they
could have been so unsuspecting.
“You d idn’t think a m urderer lived above
you,” said M indy Messinger, 21, of Overland
Park, who was Kleypas’ only housem ate who
was hom e M arch 29, the night before Williams’
body was found two houses away.
“H e was a Ted B undy ty p e,” said a
housekeeper in the Family and Consum er
Sciences w here both Kleypas and Williams
took classes. “H e was what you could call
charming. H e could turn it o n.”
His quick capture did much to allay students’
concerns.
“I have no fears right now,” said Kelly
A lderson, a freshm an from Kansas City, Mo.
“W hen the guy was on the loose, that was my
biggest fear.”
Much of the concern on the part of parents
was about how their children could be sharing
classrooms with a paroled m urderer, Taylor
said.
P at O akley, a m o th er of two college
students from Kansas City, said she resigned
herself to expecting dangers no m atter where
h er children are. H er oldest, Chris, is a senior
at Kansas State. H er son David is a 20-year-old
political science m ajor at Pittsburg State.
“I think the kids just have to keep their wits
about them ,” she said. “I do a lot of praying.”

Black college reunion can not party on city property
D A Y TO N A B EA C H , Fla. (A P)—Black College R eunion visitors have a place to party
next weekend, but it w on’t be on city property.
O ne day after an unsuccessful, last-ditch effort to restore leases to use city property for
several events, sponsors of the April 12-14 gathering secured a place Friday to hold a major
concert.
Reggae Sunsplash will be held at the beachfront A d am ’s M ark H otel, reunion task force
leader Barry Simms said. Considered the highlight of the three-day reunion, the concert
features a large reggae show from Kingston, Jamaica.
“T he Sunsplash is a go,” Simms said. “T here will be steel bands, island fashions and live
music.”
Prom oters had been planning to stage the concert at D aytona B each’s City Island Park or
Jackie R obinson Stadium.
But the city canceled the leases because O rlando prom oter A ntonio Phillips missed three
deadlines to pay $40,000 to use city property and obtain extra police protection, M ayor Bud
A sher said.
O ther festivities on tap during the reunion include the Gospel Jubilee, which features
concerts, singing contests and religious services.
Organizers project that up to 100,000 students from across the nation will attend the reunion.
Some 125,000 people attended last year.

Senate Committee probing new
details about Whitewater figure
W ASHINGTON (AP)—Before the Senate
W hitewater Committee expired five weeks ago,
it turned up new evidence about a controversial
Arkansas bond dealer’s efforts to lobby thenGov. Bill Clinton a decade ago.
Senate investigators found that on at least one
occasion in the mid-1980s, businessman Dan
Lasater got a private audience with Clinton and
made a blunt pitch for state contracts.
The Senate panel also found that in 1985,
weeks before it was disclosed in federal court
that Lasater had helped pay off a drug debt for
Clinton’s brother, the businessman sent a letter to
the governor requesting monthly meetings and
advance warnings of contract opportunities.
The tone prom pted one top aide to scrawl
“outrageous” atop the letter. B ut Clinton’s
administration didn’t push Lasater away.
A few months later, Clinton and his aides
m onitored Lasater’s progress in securing a piece
of the state bond business for a proposed $30
million state police communications system.
Rumors that Lasater had given a low-ball bid
so worried Clinton’s chief of staff, Betsey Wright,
that she wrote, “Guv—we have real problem
here.”
Later, when a state lawmaker suggested the
project might be better financed through other
means, the governor’s aides urged L asater’s
company to do m ore lobbying, docum ents
reviewed by The Associated Press show.
“I have suggested” that executives at Lasater’s
firm “get” an A rkansas state police
commissioner to contact the lawmaker, Wright
wrote Clinton on May 13,1985.
The internal memos assembled by Senate
investigators could provide a new avenue for
W hitew ater hearings once they resum e.
Democrats and Republicans have not agreed
how to extend the investigation.
Lasater participated in 15 state contracts but
says that overall the business wasn’t profitable.
He says other bond houses had been getting
favorable treatm ent and he simply wanted the
governor “to level the playing field.”
“We tried to make as much hay as we could
with Clinton and tried to get as much business as
we could but it never worked,” Lasater said.

Wright said Clinton’s office never favored
Lasater but did direct agencies to invite more
bond houses to bid on state business to increase
competition.
In
the
mid-1980s, Lasater was a
m ultim illionaire investm ent banker who
contributed to Clinton’s campaigns and hired
Clinton’s younger brother, Roger.
Roger Clinton and Lasater became the focus
of a drug probe, and both pleaded guilty to
cocaine charges and went to prison.
The state contracts, the drugs and the ties to
Roger Clinton have long made Lasater a political
issue during Clinton's campaigns for governor
and president.
For instance, C linton’s campaign was
confronted in 1992 about the state police
contract. Aides said at the time that Clinton had
“no role in the review of the proposals or the
vote” on the 1985 project and “did not steer the
business” to Lasater.
What Clinton did not disclose, however, was
the attention his office gave Lasater.
Two days before a state police commission
subcommittee narrowed the field of competitors
for the contract, Clinton got a scribbled warning
from his chief of staff.
Wright wrote that there was “street talk” that
Lasater “put in unreasonably low bid knowing he
can raise it once he” is awarded the contract.
Clinton wrote back: “Lasater should be told”
to stick with his original proposal. The word
“told” was underlined.
O f eight com petitors on the state police
project, the proposal submitted by E.F. Hutton,
Lasater and a third firm won the contract.
L asater and the form er executive vice
president of his company, Michael Drake, said
the “street talk” was false gossip spread by bitter
com petitors. Their firm got a $115,000
management fee for the state police contract but
lost money, they said.
Lasater said he met with Clinton in 1983 or
1984 and made a pitch that his firm was “entitled
to some” of the state business.
“Clinton said that he’d look into it,” Lasater
recalled. “He made no commitments at all and it
didn’t help us any at all.”

College freshman says he’ll continue
living, learning at University of Nebraska
T R U M B U L L , Neb. (A P )— A n 18-year-old University of N ebraska-K earney freshm an was
happy to hear that he did not have break out the moving boxes and relocate to the dorm itory
for the rem ainder of the school year.
Douglas R ad er of Trumbull filed and won a lawsuit against the school saying he should not
be required to adhere to dorm itory life because of his religious beliefs.
“Yeah, people are pretty happy around here,” R ader said from his hom e as he and his
family prepared to celebrate the E aster holiday. “We’re thanking the L ord.”
U.S. M agistrate Judge David Piester ruled that a UNK policy requiring all freshm en to live
on campus was unconstitutional insofar as it was applied to Rader. Piester ordered the
university to refrain from enforcing in any way the Kearney campus housing policy against
Rader.
R ader had protested against a cam pus rule that requires all full-time freshm an to live in oncampus housing. Students who are m arried, 19 years old, or living with a parent or guardian
are exem pt from the rule.
During a trial in M arch, university officials said the rules fostered diversity, prom oted
tolerance, increased academ ic achievem ent and im proved the graduation rate.
But R ader said living in a dorm would expose him to influences contrary to his Christian
faith. H e w anted to live in the Christian Student Fellowship (CSF) house off-campus.
“I have heard from many of my classmates and friends of the wild lifestyles allowed in
dorm itories at U N K ,” he said earlier. “The obnoxious alcohol parties in the dorm itories, the
immoral atm osphere and the intolerance toward those who profess to be Christians would
severely hinder my free exercise of religion and be a definite hardship on m e.”
The school allowed R ader to live in the CSF house until the suit was settled. R ader turns
19 in May, a factor which will exem pt him from the policy. H e will continue to live at the
religious house, he said.
“1 will live there next year and probably the rest of my days in Kearney.”
R ad er’s attorney, Jeff D ow ning of Lincoln, said the decision might have national
significance.
“It may provide guidance to college adm inistrators across the country because other cases
involving housing rules have not involved religious issues,” Downing said.
R ader said he was glad the ruling went his way, but hadn’t really thought about the
nationwide implications.

Shakespeare’s ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ set to open on April 13
University News Services
A ncient folklore has it that a m aiden will dream
of her future husband on m idsum m er’s eve and
William Shakespeare was certainly steeped in that
folklore and the world of magic, so much so that he
penned one of his m ost fam ous comedies with that
fairy world in mind. A M idsum m er N ight’s D ream ,
with its m yriad of tales and magical portrayals, will
be staged at 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Saturday,
A pril 11-13 and 18-20, and at 2 p.m. Sunday, April 14
and 21, all in S lU E ’s C om m unications Building
theater.
D irector David Q uinn, who gave us Man o f La
Mancha last summer, has his hands full this time with
22 actors in the cast. “This is the largest cast 1 ve ever
directed and it’s been quite a challenge,” says Quinn,
a m em ber of the adjunct faculty of the departm ent
of th eater and dance.
“The language has also been a challenge, but I’m
fortunate that (Professor) Bill G rivna and (Assistant
Professor) P eter Cocuzza are helping with that.”
The two professors, both m em bers of the theater
faculty, are currently teaching Shakespeare in their
classes. In addition, Professor Cocuzza is a vocal
coach and is helping with some of the language,
while Professor Grivna has been lending a hand with
the S hakespearian acting. “They have been an
im mense help,” Professor Q uinn said, “in bringing
about my concept fo r this play.”
M idsum m er involves three stories— the du k e’s
m arriage and four young lovers chasing each other
through the woods, the rude m echanicals and their
planning a play for the d u k e’s wedding feast, and the
fairies playing tricks on the hum ans in the magical

forest. “Theseus, the duke, is planning his m arriage to
Hippolyta, Q ueen of the Amazons,” Professor Q uinn
explained. “Egeus, the father of H erm ia, brings her
to the duke, asking him to approve of the m arriage
arrangem ent that he has m ade for H erm ia and
Demetrius.
“However, H erm ia loves Lysander and runs off
with him, followed by D em etrius who in turn is
followed by Flelena, a form er lover of D em etrius,”
he said. “M eanw hile, the six rustics— or rude
mechanicals as Shakespeare referred to them —have
been asked by the D uke to put on a play for the
wedding feast. However, we see they are neither
actors nor playwrights, providing som e of
Shakespeare’s most famous comic scenes.”
Professor Quinn addressed the usual wariness
som e audiences have about understanding a
S hakespeare play because of the E lizabethan
language. “This is one of Shakespeare's m ore sensual
plays, with love, lust and passion entertw ined in
magic and comedy,” he said, “Though the language is
richly poetic and, of course, Shakespearean, the
audience will have no problem s understanding the
play because of our interpretation and the magic
that our cast brings to the stage.
“I’m excited that one of our students, Nathan
Hahs, a junior studying musical theater, is writing
original music for the production. And, that is a
m ajor contribution,” Professor Q uinn said. “H e is a
talented singer, actor and writer who 1 worked with
in Man o f La Mancha, in which he was assistant
music director.
“The music is sure to enhance both the dram a and
the comedy,” Professor Q uinn said. “ In addition,
Janet Strzelec, a dance major, is choreographing
several scenes in the play in order to add even m ore

magic to the fairy world w e’re creating. We’ve also
cast four dance m ajors to be part of the fairy
ensemble. With all this talent working together, this
is going to be one of our m ore exciting productions.”
Tickets for A M idsum m er Night's Dream are $6;
senior citizens, S1UE faculty and staff, all students;

Pee Shy d elivers on debut CD
By Lcnon M aguire
Lifestyle R eporter
What do you get when you com bine four people with drums, bass, keyboards,
clarinet, and two accordions? In the case of Pee Shy, you get a brilliant new band
on M ercury Records with an incredible debut CD titled Who Let A ll the M o nkey’s
Out?.
The disc arrived in the mail about three weeks ago. A fter noticing that the band
was playing at C icero’s that night, I gave them a listen. A fter track two, I knew that
I would be seeing them later that evening.
The band comes from Tampa, Florida, but musically they are definitely from
som ewhere else. Their sound comes from a magical piece of land located
som ewhere between Lou Barlow and Stereolab. I don’t know exactly where this
beautiful place is, but 1 would love to find out because I would m ake frequent
visits. (I wouldn’t be able to live there because I would be happy too much of the
time).
The album consists of 16 tracks, including three spoken word. Each cut is
wonderfully w ritten with clever lyrics and beautifully haunting sounds, from both
instrum ents and vocals, that leave you waiting anxiously for the next song. The
clarinet and accordions vividly express the m oods of the band better than any
synthesizer ever could. From upbeat and lively to dark and brooding, the album is
full of heart and emotion.
A high point in the album is the song “Little Dudes,” which is also the first
single. The 30-year-old band m em bers describe what it is like to be attracted to
younger men. “Where are yo u little dude?/D on’t you know I'm in love with
you?/You got m e thinking like a naughty lady./Got m e thinking ‘bout Greg and Mrs.
Brady. ” This is a prim e example of the witty, well written lyrics that are found on
the rest of the album.
I listened to the disc three times before I went to the club that night. I arrived at the show wondering if it was possible to play feedback accordion, and I found
out that not only is it possible, but it is very enjoyable to listen to. O n stage, the band is very tight and lively. They are as fun to watch as well as hear. They move
pretty well for people strapped to accordions.
Once again, this is a great album. All of the songs are well crafted, indie-pop songs with a lot of character. The spoken word tracks support the dark m oods and
are a very welcome addition. I’ve found another album for my year end “best o f ’ list. It has been a good couple of weeks.
If this is what Pee Shy’s first album sounds like, I can’t wait to hear their second.
□OO
There was a m isprint in the fragile Porcelain Mice review from last Tuesday. The article should have said that Dave W inkeler, not Winkler, plays eight to ten
notes per second, not three to four. There was never any intent to take anything away from Dave, the band, or the album because all three are great. I apologize for
any inconvenience this may have caused. Frostbidding is truly one of the best albums of 1996. It has been over a week and it still has not left my car stereo or CD

Being a vegetarian—You just can't beat it.

For the A lestle
Being a vegetarian is a choice

them selves are as varied as their
reasons for becoming vegetarians.

others do it sim p ly to make

m entally and physically.
M any studies have shown that
eating a vegetableJbased diet can in
som e cases reduce the chances of
som e chro nic ailm e n ts such as
cancer, cardiovascular disease, and
other d ise a se s. H ow ever, if a
vegetarian diet is not followed in
the correct m anner it can actually

W hen

the
term
"vegetarian" they think of som eone who just
doesn't eat meat. T h is thinking is not necessarily
correct. There are different types of vegetarians;
there are lacto-vegetarians who eat eggs and
diary food but no anim al flesh . These are
com m only referred to as just vegetarians. Then
there are sem i-vegetarians who eat diary foods
and eggs and occasionally include fish and
chicken but no other anim al flesh. The last two
types of vegetarians are ov-vegetarians, who
eat eggs but no diary products or anim al flesh,
and veg ans, who eat no anim al foods of any
type.

For M cClearey, it w as more than just physical
reasons that made him to decide to become a

McClearey, he hasn't really encountered any

faithful to hss comn ~ment to noi eat
meat, not trying to convert others to
vegetarianism .
For Meyer there were different
reasons behind her becom ing a
vegetarian 14 m onths ago; she figured
out that she doesn't like the iaste of
meat. A lso, M eyer says that she feels
better, both m en taiy, and physically,
now that she doesn't eat meat though
she still gets questions, and in some
cases ridicule, from people who don't
understand
or
support
being
vegetarian.
Goodwin became a vegetarian
som ew here between three to four
years ago "because of health reasons.
"I w as 250 pounds, and had
alw ays been active and sport-oriented
but became lazy," Goodwin said.
Goodwin saw that m any of his
friends were giving vegetarianism a
try and decided to try it him self.
Goodwin adm its that it is not easy being a
vegetarian, especially in the Midwest. One of
the biggest problems is finding restaurants that
offer vegetarian food. Som e restaurants in the
St. Louis area that do are the Sunshine Inn and
Cicerro's. When there are not any vegetarian
dishes on the m enu, Goodwin goes with a dish
that most vegetarians seem to enjoy, a pasta
dish without any meat.
Another problem for vegetarians is trying to
get enough protein in their diet which means
eating a lot of beans and legumes.
In spite of all this, Goodwin said, "For overall
health, you just can't beat it."

Baseball continues to struggle in conference
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor
With three doubleheaders in three
days against conference opponents, the
E aster w eekend looked like a great
opportunity for the SIU E baseball team
to get themselves back in the middle of
the G reat Lakes Valley C onference
cham pionship race.
However, the E aster Bunny d idn’t
put enough runs in the Cougars’ basket
and as a result, they won only two of the
six games.
The holiday w eekend got off to a
good start on Friday as the Cougars
played on Roy Lee Field for the first
time all season and swept a pair from
Kentucky Wesleyan by the scores of 6-1
and 11-5. B ut then, just as the w eather
turned cold again, so did the Cougars
bats as they m anaged a total of five runs
in two games against Bellarm ine on
S aturday and the S outhern Indiana
pitching staff held the Cougars to just
two runs in the Sunday doubleheader.
“Now w e’re going to just loosen up
and play,” head coach G ary Collins said
Sunday after the Cougars lost their
fourth gam e in tw o days. “W e’re
probably out of the conference race
now.”
W ith th e tough w eekend, the
Cougars fell to 19-14 overall and a
disappointing 7-11 in the GLVC. The

the Cougars continued to struggle in the GLVC with a 2-4 record over the
“O ur only chance at post season play
weekend against three conference opponents.

is to m ake the conference tournam ent,”
Collins said. “But for that we have to
finish at least fourth.”
The w eekend looked as though it
was going to be a good one after the
sw eep of K entucky W esleyan. The
C ougars
got
a
great
pitching
perfo rm an ce from freshm an Jason
G uest in game one. The Nashville, 111.,
native went the com plete seven innings
while allowing only four hits and one
earned run to push his record to 4-0 this
season.
In Friday’s second game, the offense
took center stage as the Cougar hitters
pounded four P anther pitchers for 11
runs on 11 hits. S ophom ore M ark
Briggs led the charge with three hits
while John Spotanski and Brian Geluck
added two each. M ike Vogt threw five
solid innings to pick up the win while
John E bersohl worked the final four
innings for the save.
O n Saturday, the cold air began to
affect the C ougar bats as they struggled
th rough
the
twin-bill
against
B ellarm ine. In the first game, both
team s m anaged to score in only one
inning each. The problem though was
that the Cougars only scoring was two
runs in th e first while the Knights
m anaged six runs in the third to provide
the m argin for victory.
The second game against Bellarmine
featured an offensive onslaught, once
again though, the problem was that it

Five G reat Lakes Valley C onference victories were
added to the SIU E softball team ’s impressive record over
the w eekend to put them at 26-8 overall. The Cougars
traveled to Indianapolis to play three GLVC team s in a
total of six games.
They kicked off the w eekend on Friday afternoon by
defeating IU PU -Fort Wayne 13-1.
Later in the day, the Cougars woiild face their only set­
back of the w eekend as they fell to Indianapolis 2-0.
SIU E bounced back for the third and final game of the
day against Bellarmine. The Cougars needed nine innings
to pull out an 11-6 win. Freshm an Jessica Silbe racked up
the victory on the mound.
SIU E continued on Saturday where they had left off.
They defeated Bellarm ine in a tighter game which ended 54. Sophom ore D eanna Smith recorded the win.
The next game was a rem atch against Indianapolis. The
Cougars received som e revenge in a 3-0 shutout of the team
which handed them only their second GLVC loss a day
earlier. Silbe won her sixth game in a row as the C ougar
hurler.
To wrap up the weekend, D eanna Smith pitched a 6-0
shutout of IU PU -Fort Wayne. The win gave her a record of
10-2 on the m ound this year.
Jennifer Smith leads the team in batting average at .449.
She has five hom e runs*and 22 RBI.

Cougars. The Knights pounded out 20 hits
that plated 15 runs off of three Cougar
hurlers while the Cougars could only scrape
together three runs.
As the holiday set in, there was hope that
the Cougars would be able to salvage a
couple m ore wins before the w eekend
ended, but it wasn’t m eant to be and once
again the Cougars were swept away.
Southern Indiana got a great pitching
perform ance in the first contest as Craig
Shoobridge threw a seven-hit shutout and
the Cougars fell 5-0. The only highlight for
the Cougars in the game was a record setting
hit by Briggs, who with a fifth-inning single,
broke the SIU E record for longest hitting
streak. The single gave the W ood R iver
native a hit in 23 consecutive games,
breaking the old record of 22 set by Todd
C arter in 1992.
The Sunday nightcap featured a great
pitching duel betw een the C ougars Jeff

A l e s t l e

R id en o u r and D oug A llison of the
Screaming Eagles.
A fter giving up three runs in the first
inning, R idenour settled down to pitch the
final eight innings w ithout allowing another
run to cross the plate. W ith R idenour
keeping them in the game, it was up to the
offense to battle back from the three-run
deficit.
The offense could not break through
though and the only runs they could manage
w ere on R yan C raw ford’s fourth-inning
single that scored R idenour and Jeff Silvey.
The Cougars could not m anage anything
else against Allison and eventually dropped
their fourth in a row, 3-2.
The rough weekend left Collins searching,
for answers.
“ I d o n ’t know what it is,” Collins said.
“W e’ve just played poorly in the last few
games.”
The Cougars will have a chance to get
back on track Tuesday w hen they host

clash.

“We had some great individual perform ances and for them
it was a very good meet. B ut for the other ones, we were out

A nother set back came when one of the w om en’s top

“We have never ran the sprint medley, well as long as I have
been here, and th at’s mainly because we haven’t had any
sprinters. For a new event we ran rath er well. It was probably
one of the w om en’s better perform ances,” F rerker said.
The Cougars then had the distance medley relay in which
the men placed 7th in. The quartet consisted of Wolf, Lay,
Travis R oundcount, and Gus C oronado all combining for a

“We were a little bit off of what we w anted to accomplish.
We were far off our school record in which we w anted to come

Individually the Cougars faired rather well. C oronado took

Bad knees may force Phillies’ Daulton to retire
P H IL A D E L P H IA
(A P )—
In
an
announcem ent that could be a precursor
to his retirem ent, Philadelphia Phillies
catch er-tu rn ed -o u tfielder
D a rren
D aulton said Sunday his bad knees were
forcing him on to the disabled list.
D aulton, 34, said he would head for
the Phillies’ spring training base in
Clearw ater, Fla. to begin rehabilitation
on his right knee, which he injured last
July while running the bases.But judging
by what he said, and by the tears in the
eyes of ow ner Bill Giles and m anager Jim
Fregosi, it could very well be that
D aulton, w hose 16 seasons in the
Philadelphia organization gives him the
longest tenure with one team of any
current NL player, has played his last
game.
“Right now, I do n ’t know if the knee is
healed up, and I d o n ’t know if it ever will
be,” D aulton said after the Phillies’ game
against Cincinnati was rained out.
D aulton, who has had a total of nine
knee operations, said he came to the
conclusion that he was hurting the team
after Saturday night’s game against the
Reds. Specifically, he said he saw pitches
that he should have been able to drive,
but was unable to do so.

“ I thought if I could help this club
offensively, that was the m ost im portant
thing,” said D aulton, who was 2-for-12—
both singles—with no RBIs in the young
season.
“Last night, I realized I couldn’t do
that. I just had no base underneath me.”
The loss was the second m ajor one for
the Phillies in the first week of the
season. First basem an Gregg Jefferies
will be out at least two m onths after
injuring his left thum b in a headfirst slide
Thursday night.
Prior to the injury, the right knee was
D aulton’s “good” knee: he has also had
eight operations on his left knee.D aulton
said h e ’d used the right knee as a crutch
for his bad left knee and, once that crutch
was gone, he could no longer withstand
the rigors of catching.
So the Phillies, who owed D aulton a
guaranteed $10 million in the next (wo
seasons and who valued his clubhouse
leadership, decided to switch him to left
field.Although he dropped some balls in
spring training, the bigger problem was
D aulton’s general health. E ven after an
extensive rehabilitation this offseason, he
still ran gingerly in spring training.
A sked if he had thought about

retiring, D aulton joked, “Which year?”
“Sure,” he answered. “ I’m looking at that
right now, just for the fact that I do n ’t
know. Last night was the first night that,
while I was playing, I thought to myself,
'W hat are you doing?”’
A lthough D aulton said he didn’t know
how long it would take him to know
whether he can return, team physician
Dr. Phillip M arone said the team
expected to know about D au lto n ’s fate
within a month.
D aulton said he m ade his decision
quickly so that the Phillies can learn to
adapt w ithout him early in the season.
“T h e re ’s a lot of talen t com ing up
through this organization and I d o n ’t
want to the guy to stop that, or to not
allow the rest of that to blossom,” he
said.
W ith his voice cracking, Fregosi
praised D aulton, one of the mainstays on
“M acho Row,” a swaggering group of
players that helped the Phillies win the
NL pennant in 1993.
“ I’ve never had a player that gave as
much as he gave,” Fregosi said. “H e gave
all he could give. A nd 1 really take it as an
honor to have been able to m anage this
guy”
