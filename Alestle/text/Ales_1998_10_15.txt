Morris dedication marks Founders’ Day
SIU President Ted Sanders and SIUE
Chancellor David Werner will join with
Dorothy Morris at II a.m. today at the
Donal Myer Arboretum near University
Drive as a tree is dedicated to the memory
of Delyte W. Morris, one of SIU’s
founders.
Dorothy Morris will be coming from
her home in North Carolina to attend the
Founders Day ceremony and the day’s
other events. Peter Morris, a son of the

SIU founder, will also be on hand.
Morris was a founder of SIU and
served as president of the university
system from 1948 to 1971.
After the dedication, there will be a
reception for SIUE students at 11:30 a.m.
in the Goshen Lounge in the Morris
University Center.
The center will be formally
rededicated in Morris’ name at 2 p.m.
today.

The ceremony in the center’s
Meridian Hall will also include the
rededication of the William G. Stratton
Quadrangle and Founders Hall, which was
formerly Classroom Building II. A
reception will follow the ceremony and all
are invited to attend.
Officials will also honor individuals
and organizations that helped establish the
Edwardsville campus in the late 1950s.
Chief among these will be Morris.

“SIUE wouldn’t be here without the
vision of Delyte M orris,” SIUE
Chancellor David Werner said.
Those attending the ceremony will
receive free commemorative booklets
containing a pictorial history of Morris’
years at SIUE from 1957 through 1970.
This span includes his tenures at the East
St. Louis campus and Shurtleff College in
Alton, which later became the dental
school.

Last day to vote for Homecoming king and queen
Today is your last chance to vote for the
Homecoming king and queen.
Voting is from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. in the Morris
University Center. Students must have a valid SIUE ID to
vote. No write-in votes will be counted.
There are 10 king and 10 queen candidates. All
candidates have a 2.5 cumulative grade point average and

have done at least 25 hours of community service.
The new homecoming king and queen will be
announced at the annual Homecoming Coronation. The
ceremony begins at 9:30 p.m. Saturday. The coronation is
scheduled for 11:30 p.m. and the dance will end at 12:30
a.m.
The homecoming king and queen will have many

obligations. They are the host and the hostess for SIUE at
many events, including university recruitment efforts.
Some of the other responsibilities are to kick off and
participate in the Springfest, serve on next year’s king and
queen selection committee and crown next year’s king
and queen.

S tudents, em ployers get to m eet
during SIUE O k to b e r C areer Fest

BY BARBARA DUMOULIN
NEWS STRINGER
No,
you
were
not
hallucinating. There really was
a bright red Humvee outside the
University Center Wednesday.
The vehicle was part of the
Marine Corps display at the
Oktober Career Fest and
Volunteer Fair.
Jean Paterson, director of
the Career Development Center,
said she was pleased with the
turnout.
"We've got about 153
employers here today," Paterson
said.
"We don't know the exact
number of students yet, but I'm
going to guess it's close to
1,000."

Paterson said there were
more health-care employers
than in the past, and a good
number
of
technology
companies.
Scott
Warren,
senior
business engineer for Sumaria
Systems Inc., an engineering
firm, said this is the first time
his company has participated in
a college career day.
"It's been very good,"
Warren said. "It's been money
well spent to see this volume
and quality of people in three to
four hours."
Paterson said the October
career day is one of two career
days the campus offers. The
next one, Career Network '99,
will be March 17.

Industrious grad student brings
a bygone era into the present

‘60s throwback Tim Slape

BARBARA DUMOULIN
NEWS STRINGER
His ponytail, goatee and
sandals are reminiscent of days
gone by. A soft-spoken voice and
easy-going demeanor make it
appear as if Tim Slape, a mass
communications graduate student
missed his generation.
“He’s a throwback to the
‘60s,” said Tom Dehner, news
director at WSIE radio station.
Slape is a news reporter and
announcer at the station. “To a
casual observer, it may appear
that Tim is indifferent, but he is
not,” Dehner said. “He is

industrious. He is very involved.”
Any resemblance to a flower
child
ends
with
Slape’s
appearance and his politics. His
full schedule and lofty goals
would make a hippie stroll for
cover.
Slape pays the cost of his
graduate studies by working
three jobs: the job at WSIE; as a
lab technician in the mass comm
department, and at a bicycle shop
in Edwardsville.
In traditional ‘60s-style
protest, Slape rails against forced
parking permits. He parks his
truck at the SIUE soccer field and
rides his bike the rest of the way
to the campus.
“Either you pay their fine or
pay their sticker fee,” Slape said.
“There should be some free
parking available somewhere.”
Slape comes to the graduate
program at SIUE after earning
his bachelor’s degree in mass
communications at Milliken
University in Decatur, 111.
Dehner feels that Slape’s
personality complements the
crew in the news room. “Tim is a
nice addition to our news staff.

We have multiple personalities
and styles. Tim brings something
unique to the staff, and as an
advanced student, he is able to
help some of the younger
students here.”
Slape plans to complete his
graduate studies and go on to
receive his doctorate. He would
like to become a communications
professor at a small college,
where he can be intimately
involved with students.
Dehner’s opinion of Slape’s
future looks a little different.
“He’s a sleeper,” Dehner said. “I
wouldn’t be at all surprised if
someday he’s in an upper
management position with pin­
stripes and a power tie at a
broadcasting outlet.”
Slape
laughs
at
this
assessment. “I don’t see that
happening - unless I go bald,”
Slape said. “Bald would go better
with a pin-striped suit.”
One thing
is certain,
ponytail or pin-stripes, Slape
won’t be laid back, zoned out or
sittin’ in.

Bill Gates donates to S t. Louis Public Library
ST. LOUIS (AP) - For 10year-old
Alex
Daugherty,
computers are better than
Nintendos.
"You can do research, you
can play games, you can play on
the Internet,” Daugherty said
Tuesday as he played the Magic
School Bus game on a computer
at the Julia Davis branch of the
St. Louis Public Library in north
St. Louis.
That’s good news for

Microsoft Corp. founder Bill
Gates, who also was at the library
Tuesday to dedicate a computer
center that his Gates Library
Foundation helped finance.
The foundation gave the St.
Louis Public Library System
$175,000 for its computer
program. The libraries will use
that money to install 58
computers, including the 17 that
have been hooked up at the Julia
Davis Branch Library.

Over a span of five years, the
foundation plans to spend $200
million to bring new computers
and the Internet to public
libraries nationwide. Microsoft
also is donating $200 million
worth of software to the project.
Already, 1,000 public
libraries have been awarded
grants.
"T h e success has been
really gratifying,” Gates told a

Letter to the E ditor ------------You’ve come a long way
The ad said, “You’ve come a
long way, baby.” It meant
women. The ad was superficial,
but it was correct.
Women have come a long
way because of the bullish
determination of pioneers who
dragged their sisters out of the
Stone Age.
Society put. the weaker sex in
its place. Women had few legal
rights. Some were forced into
arranged, repugnant marriages,
and some married for survival
and suffered abuse.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton
called a meeting of the first
Women’s Rights Convention in
1848 at her home in Seneca Falls,
N.Y.
She
published
the
Declaration of Sentiments, which
stated, “We hold these truths to
be self-evident; that all men and
women are created equal.”
In 1861, Stanton pleaded
unsuccessfully before the New
York’ Senate to make willful
desertion and cruelty grounds for
divorce. It became New York law
in 1966.
Education was not universal;
therefore, poor women had little
hope for a future beyond
domestic service, or the pitiful
rewards for a seamstress.
However, in 1849 Elizabeth
Blackball graduated head of her
class and became the first woman
in the United States to receive a
medical degree. She had applied
to 29 schools before admission to
Geneva College in New York.
She had to fight to attend
anatomy classes.
Mary
Edward
Walker
became the first female surgeon
in the U.S. Army in 1865. She
was a confederate prisoner and
was later awarded the Medal of
Honor.
Women could not vote until
the 19th Amendment was ratified

in August 1920. But in 1872
Susan B. Anthony led a march to
Rochester’s city hall to demand
she be registered to vote. She
defied the law by casting a ballot
in a New York election.
Dorothea Dix took charge of
a women’s Sunday school class
at a Boston prison in 1841.
Horrified by the miserable
conditions, she dedicated her life
to social reform. Dix was
appointed superintendent of
women nurses serving the
American Red Cross in 1881.
Clara Barton founded the
American Red Cross in 1881.
Fannie Farmer published the
first edition of her “Boston
Cooking School Cook Book” in
1896. And Margaret Sanger
opened the first birth control
clinic in 1916 in Brooklyn, N.Y.
Two
women
were
inaugurated governor of their
states in 1925. The first women
to be elected to the office were
Nellie Tyler Ross in Wyoming
and Miriam “Ma” Ferguson in
Texas.
Women have come a long
way. These are but a sample of
, the foremothers who lit the torch
and carried it.

Alcohol rights and
responsibility
There have been different
slogans over the years ... “Friends
Don’t Let Friends Drive Drunk,”
“Know When to Say When,” “If
You Choose to Drink, Drink
Responsibly” ... but the message
of the Alcohol Awareness Week

has always been the same — the
choice to drink is yours; choose
wisely.
I don’t intend to get into a
debate about underage drinking
here. There is no one out there
who doesn’t know that it is not
legal to purchase or consume
alcohol if you are under 21 years
of age. Those living in Woodland
and Prairie Halls know that
according to University Housing
policy no alcohol is allowed in
those buildings. As I said earlier,
what I am talking about here is
choice. Just as you must realize
that if you choose to break a law
or housing policy you must pay
the consequences, so you should
realize that if you choose to
drink, you must deal with those
consequences.
If you choose to drink, think
about the other choices you make
beforehand. Make responsible
choices. Choose a designated
driver. Choose not to drink so
much you lose your judgment.
Choose to monitor your own
drinks so no one can slip a drug
in one of them. Choose not to
endanger your life by consuming
enough alcohol to poison
yourself. Choose not to drink
when it might interfere with your
classes or class work. Never let
alcohol make your choices for
you.
October 19-23 is National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness
Week. Many informative and fun
events are planned, culminating
with Tons of Fun IX, from 9 p.m.
to 2 a.m., Friday, Oct. 23 in the
Student Fitness Center. Have fun
at these events and take some
time to think about drinking and
the choices you make.

I was sitting in class just the other day taking a
midterm when the big question popped up in my head.
Why?
The world of academia and I have always been
involved in this war of love and hate. I love to learn; I
Danielle hate midterms. There was once a time when you could
Belton have walked up to a charming little 8-year-old Danielle
Belton and she would have told you she liked tests. She could give
you two reasons:
# \ She always got an A.
#2 It showed she really was smarter than everyone else in
her class.
Ah, I was so young and full of myself back then.
But somewhere along my academic trail I lost my
photographic memory and sponge-like mind. Although I am still just
as eager to learn, I have grown to dislike midterms. This is not
because they force me to study but because they never represent
what I have actually learned.
I had four tests last semester in critical thinking. I got a C
in the class. I remember nothing. I took Writing for the Media my
freshman year, got a B and was a horrible writer. I have had several
classes that I can’t even remember what they were about. And I fear
that what I studied this week for midterms, I won’t even recall next
week.
Absolutely nothing is working its way into the long-term
memory. All this midterm madness and studying for what? My mind
will be a total blank once I’m done filling in the dots on the Scantron
sheet. And it's this way for many students.
For many classes such as math,' science and theory courses,
testing is necessary. There’s no way you’re going to get around
understanding two plus two without practicing and testing. But in
many classes students aren’t learning and understanding what is
being taught. They are merely regurgitating what the instructors are
feeding them. Often there is no real independent thinking or
learning, just classrooms filled with yes men and yes women and
inane ramblings. I thirst for classes where open discussion is
welcome, hands-on experience is available and grades are based on
a student's comprehension, not how eloquently a student can
rephrase an instructor’s spewing. Believe me. I know. I’ve
eloquently rephrased many a professor’s spewing all the way to an
A, but did I ever really learn? Where did the professor’s thoughts end
and my thoughts begin?
In many classes students learn one skill. And it is a skill
they will use for the rest of their lives. It is the skill of survival.
Knowing just enough to not look stupid, learning just enough to get
through the day and learning how to take whatever the boss gives
you and give it back to him or her the way it’s wanted. In college, it
seems, is a time when we are yes men in training. Learning to take
the boss’ B.S. and serve it back up to him the way he likes it. I really
want to learn, I really want to understand, but where is that learning
and understanding when all I'm required to do to pass a class is to
serve the B.S. back to the boss?
Where does the kowtowing and canting end and the
learning begin? Just because I could bluff some good Spanish didn’t
mean I knew what I was saying. When I got A’s in high school that
didn’t mean I always understood the subjects. I would just memorize
the facts for as long as I needed to know them, then empty out the
old to make room for the new. There will never be creative, thoughtprovoking students unless educators start poking and provoking
those minds. The prodding should start at the very beginning.
My friends would always tell me that 1 had it easy because
the teachers liked me. But the only thing that separates me from my
friends is that a long time ago someone poked and provoked me —
that and I’m a real good B.S. regurgitator.
Why aren’t we graded for what we understand rather than
what we regurgitate? Maybe it’s harder to measure, but the rewards
would be far greater. I would have enjoyed having a real Writing for
the Media professor who would have taught me how to write.
Unfortunately I had to wait until I got to the Alestle to learn.

World population perspective
is offered by SIUE professor
BY STEPHEN WHITE
NEWS STRINGER
If everyone in the world
stood naked, their bodies
smashed together inside a giant
glass container one mile wide and
one mile high, the entire worlc^
population could be fitted on the
campus of SIUE.
Interesting stuff, no doubt.
These are the types of facts that
sociologists love. Especially
SIUE sociology professor Bob
Blain, the man in charge of

maintaining
the
“World
Population” display on the first
floor of Peck Hall.
Consider another intriguing
fact: there are roughly 6 billion
people on the planet Earth. Out of
those, fewer than 300 million are
American,
yet
Americans
consume and produce more waste
than the citizens of all other
countries combined.
The
World
Population
display at SIUE is a reminder of
just how small we are, and, Blain

said, a reminder of the
responsibility we have to make
the world a better place.
“What the world needs to
learn to do is reduce its numbers,
but more importantly is to reduce
our consumption,” Blain said.
“Because if the people in the
Third World tried to consume at
the level of the United States, we
would destroy the Earth — we’d
consume all its life-giving
capacities, kill all the animals and
we’d be dead too.”

Turn over a new leaf, turn in a book
to help underprivileged children
BY DAMEENA COX
NEWS STRINGER
Many of us had favorite
books when we were kids. But
imagine not having those books,
or any books.
Now imagine making books
available for kids who don’t have
them. You can help put books in
the homes of children in Southern
Illinois and the Metro East area.
The SIU Head Start and Child
Development
program
is
sponsoring the campaign for “A
Children’s Book in Every Head
Start Home.” Head Start is a
program that meets the social,

intellectual,
emotional
and
physical needs of preschool
children in low-income families.
Beverly Sanders, wife of SIU '
President Ted Sanders, is
spearheading
the
program.
During the first three years of the
project more than 11,000 books
were distributed to the homes of
children enrolled in the program.
The goal for this year is 3,000.
Special
containers
for
donations will be available
through Nov. 25. They can be
found in libraries, offices, student
centers, lobbies and residence
halls on SIU campuses.
In support of the campaign,

the Friends of Lovejoy Library
will exchange a book in the
Friends’ Good Buy Bookshop for
every children’s book donated
through Nov. 19. In choosing
books, please consider that they
are for children ages 2 to 6.
This year books will also be
donated to the Early Childhood
Development Center. “It just
shows how much the campus
does care,” Suzanne KuttererSiburt, assistant director of
Kimmel Leadership Center, said.

See the ultimate feel good movie October 23rd

Kyle Anderson, a secondyear political science student at
SIUE, is mapaging not one, but
two democratic candidates.
The candidates are Rep. Jay
Hoffman, D-Collinsville, and
Democrat Bob Daiber, a Marine
resident who was unsuccessful in
his first two tries for state
representative.
Anderson carries 15 credit
hours, and still finds time to
coordinate the campaigns of two
conservative candidates.
He said the one thing he
doesn’t have time for is sleep.
“Jay Hoffman’s campaign is
easier because he already holds
that office,” Anderson said. “But
Bob Daiber, a third-time runner
from the 110th district — his
campaign takes more effort.”
Anderson explained his role
as field coordinator. He organizes
the candidates’ neighborhood
walks.
He
knows
which
neighborhoods to walk because
of a database
containing

information
on
democratic
voters.
Anderson orchestrates phone
banks for candidates. He meets
with labor officials and people
from the American Association of
Retired People organization for
endorsements.
“The mark of a good
coordinator is making sure the
candidate is never in the office,
but out where the people are,”
Anderson said. “(Daiber) needs
2500 votes. He needs volunteers
for the phone banks, literature
walks, and posting campaign
signs on front yards.” Anyone
interested in volunteering can call
887-9662.
Anderson recently set up a
press conference for Daiber in
Edwardsville. Daiber said, “I’m
not walking today.” He usually
goes door to door finding out
what the people in this area care
about.
He introduces himself as a
man who cares and he tells them
he wants to help.

Size doesn’t matter,
but your health does
BY DANA MILES
NEWS STRINGER
Don’t sweat if a size 6
doesn’t fit. Try your own size
instead.
Health experts will tell
you
that
the
present
American/European ideal body
shape is a combination of
slenderness and athleticism and
that the media exploits this image
by bombarding men and women
with the messages that they have
to have this ideal body to be
happy and attractive.
Research has shown that by
age 18, 80 percent of females are
or have been actively dieting.
“Diets don’t work, never
have, never will. Dieting can
cause future weight problems,”
said Tammy Cook, an instructor
for
Transforming
Eating
Obsessions, a program offered at
SIUE.
Unhealthy dieting can lead to
eating disorders such as anorexia,
bulimia nervosa and binge eating
disorder. An eating disorder is a
collection of interrelated eating
habits. Often these habits are
weight management practices,
attitudes about food, weight and
body shape and physiological
imbalances
that
become
disordered, Cook said.
Any individual, male or
female from any social and
economic background,
can
develop an eating disorder.
Research shows that there
are psychological and personality
factors that influence the
development of eating disorders.

Some of these are: high need for
achievement,
significant
adolescent turmoil, impaired
self-concept,
struggle
with
identity
formation,
mood
instability, low self-esteem and
an inability to adapt to changes
during adolescence.
Each of these factors may
vary
from
individual
to
individual.
However,
if you
are
struggling with your weight,
there is a way to properly lose it
without harming your body.
Losing weight can be
achieved by: eating healthfuly
and within moderation. Dieters
should make sure they eat a
variety of foods, but never
overindulge.
Exercising is also very
important. Cook said. Choose
physical activities that you enjoy.
Be disciplined, but not negative.
People should get on a regular
schedule and stick to it, without
being extra hard on themselves.
“Nothing
will
change
without effort and energy,” said
Ruth Cohen Kubicek, an
instructor from the program.
“Start healthy habits now, so
that it does not catch up with you
later,” said a student in the
program.
, Transforming
Eating
Obsessions is a program geared
to teach men and women how to
develop healthy eating habits
through inner child work, guided
imagery and group discussions.

Daiber said he earned his
doctorate at SIUE. He said his
slogan, “New Leadership for
Working Families,” includes
Health
Maintenance
Organization reform, property
tax reform and safer schools for
quality education.
Anderson said, “I gained
administrative and general
experience in a successful
campaign for state Rep. Steve

did the busy work.”
Anderson said he wasn’t on
Davis’ payroll, but he earned
valuable experience that put him
in his current position as
political coordinator.
“I eventually hope to be a
political consultant who travels
all over the country helping with
campaigns,” Anderson said.
“Finally, I plan on running for
city councilman.”

Holy Halloween! What a pumpkin
HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) — Linus was right after all:
There is a Great Pumpkin.
Lincoln Mettler of Eatonville, Wash., said all it took was a small
patch of earth, a little patience and a lot of fertilizer to turn one of his
tiny pumpkin seeds into a 974-pound behemoth.
Mettler’s pumpkin took top honors Monday in the 25th annual
Half Moon Bay Great Pumpkin Weigh-Off, 20 miles south of San
Francisco.
Mettler’s winning entry was an Atlantic Giant that measured 2
feet 9 inches high and 13 feet 7 inches in circumference. His pumpkin
bested the previous contest record by about 100 pounds.
The winning pumpkin earned Mettler a $4,870 first-place prize.
The aerospace worker and part-time farmer said he would put the
proceeds from his winnings back into his small crop ot six pumpkin
patches.

LIFESTYLES EDITOR
Now that the leaves are changing and the air has become
just a little brisk, the season is right for the holiday of freaks:
Halloween. While the malls put up their Christmas trees and
roll out the holiday sales, let’s not forget the ghoulish time
that leads to All Hallow’s Eve.
As children of the night prowl through the 'burbs tossing
miles of toilet tissue into their neighbors’ trees, what are
civilized college students to do? Join the ranks of the toilet
paper vandals? Why not? That is, if you can afford to buy the
supplies. If you can’t, the Alestle has a solution: haunted
theme parks. •
Now you’re thinking, “How the hell can I afford haunted
theme parks if I can’t afford toilet paper?” Well, the Alestle
has free tickets to the Darkness Haunted Theme Park, Silo X
and Terror Visions 3-D. Now don’t get overly excited. You
can’t just collect these tickets without some type of
retribution.
We’ve got an interesting payment plan. Show up at the
Alestle office at 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 21 in full
costume. That’s right, full costume! Come as anything you
like (other than yourself) and whoever thrills, chills or
charms us the most will win two free tickets to either the
Darkness Haunted Theme Park, Silo X or Terror Visions 3D. Good luck and happy haunting!

For more information call the Alestle office at 650-3528.

LIFESTYLE STRINGER
I have to admit at the start that I have never
been one to watch reruns of television shows. But
when I was enticed by Turner Network Television to
“get caught up again” in
“ER,” I had to see if that
would really happen to
me. TNT aired the 2hour pilot episode last
week to kick off its
prime time broadcasts of
the “ER” series reruns
“ER” is a fast-paced
hospital drama written
by Michael Crichton
that began airing in
1994. The series was a
big hit when it burst on
the scene and has won numerous Emmy Awards in
its four years. “ER” takes place in the emergency
room of a Chicago hospital, but unlike medical
shows of the “Marcus Welby, M.D.” variety, this
show focuses on the medical personnel and not the
patients.

''AS OPPOSED Tch

( isTG H *l

The show often has too much bustle to
accurately portray a real-life hospital and harbors a
soap opera-like quality to the personal problems
some of the characters encounter. But it does
provide us enough realistic grist to make it much
better viewing than many other prime time dramas.
The pilot show introduces us to the characters
and
establishes
the
atmosphere of timeless­
ness and sleeplessness in
which the characters
operate.
Anthony
Edwards plays the chief
resident and in the
opening episode he is
constantly
being
awakened from sleep.
Other references to the
passage of time such as
“When did it start snowing
outside?” and “When did it start raining outside?”
are used to transmit their cocoon-like setting.
Although the characters are somewhat
predictable and, of course, all great-looking, they

RAHTS É RAV£S
BY COREY STIJÍCF
W R ITER ATI.ARC,F.

It’s time to get back to the topic that’s always
on everyone’s mind, even if they don’t want to
admit it. That’s right, baby. I’m talking about pom.
Sure, porn. It’s a billion-dollar industry in this
country and although there are probably 12 really
creepy, sweaty guys that smell like leather and
salami who account for about $750,000,000 of that
cool billion, that still leaves $250,000,000 that us
so-called normal people spend on pom every single
year.
Now myself, I probably only blow about $10 or
so out of my wad on porn a year. I prefer to let my
porn-lovin’ friends get the rest.-Whether you believe
it or not, pom gets pretty boring to me after about 20
minutes or so. For some of my friends, it’s a
lifestyle that never ends.
I’ve got one friend who would never leave his
room if he had a pee bucket and an endless supply
of Yoo Hoo, Cheetos and Kleenex. He’s got the pom
vibe that bad.
I guess there are a few things that bother or
confuse me about the whole pomo film experience.
The first is the quality of the films themselves.
I can get past the horrible acting. There’s plenty of
that in mainstream Hollywood features. I just can’t
stand the production values. The creepy camcorder
feel of the whole thing makes me feel like this could
have been done in my basement with my sister and
her friends. How is that supposed to get me excited?
Why can’t they throw a few bucks into the
mix? Get some decent costumes and lighting, film
on location and maybe have some fun cameo
appearances like Abe Vigoda or Charlotte Rae of
“Facts of Life” fame. They could use the work and
would be damn glad to get the chance to appear in
“film” once again.
Another thing that confuses me is the whole
ratings system. You’ve got the X, the XX and the
XXX. W hat’s the difference? It’s not really
explained anywhere that I’ve seen. Do they argue
like the MPAA does with real filmmakers? “OK,
take out that last ‘money shot’ and we’ll give you a
XX. Otherwise it's XXX city for your flick.”
I also don’t get the idea of porn sequels. Are
there a lot of loose ends to tie up at the end of one
of these? Did we need “Flaccid Daddies 2” or “Sgt.

Slutty’s Probe Busters 7”? And
what I notice is that it’s not
even the same cast as was in
the original. What a tease.
So now my crazy pomaddicted friend thinks he
wants to get in on the action
himself. This scares me. Sure,
I have directing ambitions,
but I don’t want that kind of
close-up, Mr. DeMille.
And of course he
wants me to recruit
people for his
epics. Why did
he ask me? Sure, I know quite a
few people but I’m not Larry Flynt or Steve Rubell.
How would some of my acquaintances react to my
asking, “Hey, you wanna make a porno?” As well as
I know some of these people, I’d get a mickey in my
drink and end up in the basement of Zed’s waiting
to meet the “Gimp.”
But he has big ambitions, my sick friend. At
least he’s going in the right direction. He wants to
make movie-parody pomos, which I think are the
funniest. And he does have a couple of amusing
ideas. His first would be a little flick called “Saving
Ryan’s Privates,” starring Tom Yanks. I laughed,
anyway.
So I decided to help him out. Earlier this week,
I took him to meet a pal of mine who was in town.
You might know him; the infamous king of pom,
Ron Jeremy. Ron’s a great guy. I mean, I gotta love
the guy. The first thing he said when he saw me was,
“Hey, you’ve lost some weight.” And coming from
the Hedgehog, that’s a compliment.
So, my buddy asked Ron what it takes to get a
script produced in the industry, and Ron was
straight with him. He said it wasn’t going to happen.
The power pom players are smart enough to avoid
unsolicited scripts so they can keep their privates
from getting stomped in a lawsuit. He told my
buddy his best bet was getting someone to finance
his flick and making it himself.
I get the feeling now that he’ll be expecting me
to start raising money for “Ryan’s Privates” for him.
I’m a good friend so I can’t say no. Possibly in the
next year, look for a big porn flick from Producer
Corey coming to a theater near you.

Say What!?

by Jill Stevens!

What do you like best
about new Chiek-fil-A?
“I like the chicken, but I
don’t like the prices.”
-Viola Willis,
Sophomore, Nursing

“You don’t have to
wait in line that long
because it’s away from
the main food area.”
-Rick Box,
Junior, Biology

“It’s something
different. I love it. It’s
one of my favorite mall
foods.”
-Tina Auten, Junior,
Anthropology/
Psychology

“They have a wide
variety of chicken to
select from.”
-Mike Taylor,
Sophomore,
Computer Science

Dear Alii Khat,
My boyfriend got a hickey from another girl. He says
he was asleep when he got it. Should I believe him?
-This Sucks

Dear This Sucks,
I'm sure your boyfriend was asleep when he got the hickey
... but don't you wonder what made him so tired?
Dear Alii Khat,
I scheduled dates with two girls on the same night,
want to date them both but I’m not sure that's such a good idea. W hat do
I do?-Double Trouble

Dear Double Trouble,
Decide which girl you like better or which one is more attractive and take
the other girl out to a scary show. Then drop her o ff and take the prettier
girl
if you know what I mean.
—

“There’s finally some
chicken around here!”

are complex. We can either
identify with them or we know
someone just like them
The show introduces us to
many of the personal
issues these characters
will face and deal with in
the coming episodes.
There is friction
between
Anthony
Edwards’ character and
his wife as he is tom
between taking the stable,
high-paying job at a
doctor’s office his wife
wants him to take and
staying on as chief resident in a
draining, low-paying job that he
believes makes a difference.
George Clooney plays the
bad boy pediatrician who
has problems with booze
and women but enough
charm to get out of most
of his troubles. He cares
deeply about the children
he treats.
Eriq LaSalle plays
the aggressive, over­
achieving
renegade
surgeon, with skillful
hands and an abrasive
personality. It is obvious
from the start that he will be
butting heads with just about
everyone he encounters on both a
personal and professional level.

C O N C E R T

CAPITAL

Noah Wyle, playing an
intern, is the new kid on the block
trying to get through his first day
without having anyone, the
patients he treats especially,

realize how little he knows.
Sherry Stringfield plays the role
of the consummately professional
resident who has no personal life

because of the hours she
dedicates to the job.
Julianna Margulies, playing
the ER’s chief nurse, is a sensitive

O c t o b e r 15, 1998 ♦

soul — too sensitive, in fact,
since she attempts to commit
suicide in this episode.
The characters move easily
between humor and drama and
that is one of the best
features of the show. The
dialogue has a natural,
realistic feel to it. In one
exchange
between
Edwards and Wyle,
Edwards as senior staffer
is giving Wyle some
advice to help cure first
day jitters. “Don’t ever
say you’re sorry [for
how you feel],” Edwards
said. “Helping them is
more important than how
we feel. But it’s still a pain in the
ass sometimes.”
Social issues are addressed in
this episode both in the context of
the plot and the casting
in the show. Teen
pregnancy; child abuse;
poor people with no
medical insurance who
are denied a full range of
treatment;
loneliness
experienced by older,
isolated patients and an
injured patient trying to
get
workman’s
compensation to cover
an injury he sustained at
iiome are just some of the
issues encountered.
Hierarchy of staff is another
issue that is addressed. The
overworked and underpaid staff

in the emergency room is
expected to make life-and-death
calls and then get up the next day
and do the same thing.
Meanwhile, staff bosses make the
big bucks and are able to have a
real life. When LaSalle is unable
to find the staff boss quickly
enough to mend a life-threatening
aneurysm, he breaks hospital
policy by
attempting
the
procedure on his own. William
Macy, the higher-up who had to
leave a society party to get there,
comes in at the end of the
procedure only to take the credit
for saving the patient’s life.
We see a certain irony when
Clooney, recovering from his allnight binge, dresses down a
mother for her abusive behavior
toward her child. His moral
stance is admirable but one can’t
help thinking, “I wonder if he’s
still drunk?”
While there are several
women and one black man cast in
positions
of
authority
or
responsibility, women and blacks
are mostly relegated to lowerlevel staff positions and white
males are in charge. It may be a
realistic representation of life but
one has to ask if it serves to
further stereotype the situation.
The innovative technical
aspects of the show — the
number of cameras and unusual
perspectives used — and the pace
of the editing all add to the look
and feel of the show. These along
with the human frailties of the
characters, the snappy dialogue
and the real-life issues dealt with
have made “ER” both a ratings
and critical success.
After watching this show
again, it’s easy to understand why
TNT used the slogan they did to
promote “ER” reruns. It is an
interesting view of the social and
political structure of one of our
most needed institutions. “ER”
gives us some insight into the
complexity of the medical field
and the people who operate
within its confines. It also makes
us wonder if there is a better way
to prepare fledgling doctors,
nurses and orderlies for their
fields rather than just throwing
them into sink or swim situations.
The show accomplishes all
this and is entertaining at the
same time. I am claiming my
chair in front of the television for
the next episode of “ER.”

COLLEEN CASEY

Running long distances is what Colleen Casey
likes to do, but there is no question that going to
Niigata City, Japan, is the farthest Casey has gone to
compete.
Casey, an assistant coordinator for admissions
at S outhern Illinois U niversity Edw ardsville
left Wednesday for Japan, to com pete in the 7th
A nnual Japan Sea Rim E kiden run. She boarded a
plane out of Springfield, Illinois, and headed to

S tudents who com plain

our
H om ecom ing should think
about supporting the team s we
do have and then, m aybe then,
the school could build a case
for starting a football team .
If SIU E sports cannot
inspire any more support than
the A tlanta Braves during the
1980s why would you bring in a
football program ?

Niigata City, Japan.
Casey is a m em ber of one of the two teams
traveling to central Japan. The twenty-six kilom eter
race is to take place at noon on Sunday, Oct. 18.
“The state of Illinois is a sister state to the
prefecture of Niigata,” said Casey. “So each year, the
city of Springfield is invited to send a team of four
m en and three women to com pete in the race.” The
other A m erican team joining the Springfield team on
Sunday is from Galveston, Texas. G alveston is the
official sister city of Niigata City.

Megan Stew ard, No. 19, b attles M issouri-R olla’s Jen
Splaingard la s t Wednesday when the Cougars b e a t up on
the Lady M iners 3-0 a t Ralph Korte Stadium.

Saturday’s Hom ecom ing game will showcase the two best
team s in the region w hen the SIU E w om en’s soccer team tries
to take over first place in the conference with a win over the
University of Southern Indiana.
Both team s are undefeated in the conference. They are
one-two in the regional, and both have national rankings. All
the signs point to a first-class war at Bob G uelker Field
Saturday.
“They’re a physical team. Probably the biggest team , in
term s of size, th at w e’ll play this season,” head coach Brian
Korbesm eyer said about Southern Indiana. “We. have to
neutralize their size with our speed.”
The Cougars will have to contend with a pair of the G reat
Lakes Valley C onference’s prem ier scorers. M egan Russell
and Jessica Pigm an are both among the top 10 in the
conference in scoring with 25 and 15 points respectively.
Sunday will be a battle that pits traditional conference
rivals head to head when the Cougars travel to Quincy.
While Quincy has a record under .500, K orbesm eyer said
his squad can’t underestim ate this excellent defensive team.
“They always play us tough and we always play them
tough,” K orbesm eyer said. “ It’s not easy playing on their
hom e field. We have to be focused because we know they’ll be
up for this game.”

H om ecom ing without helm ets— ^ * 4
Each fall w hen I retu rn to campus there
are two com plaints I can count on hearing
from the students here. O ne is that WSIE
should not be a jazz station and the other
is that SIU E does not have a football
team. Since this is a sports feature I ’ll deal
with the latter.
I understand that a lot of you come
from high schoo
at had strong football
program s. G oing to the F riday night
football game was the thing to do. I enjoy
watching college football as m uch as
anybody and would be a fan if we had a
team. B ut this isn’t high school anymore.
We are at a university which has to, at
times, be run like a business. H ere are
som e reasons why we w on’t have a
football team anytim e soon.
1. A publication called the N C A A News
reports th at th e average D ivision II
athletic
program
deficit
w ithout

institutional support is $773,000 at schools
w ithout football and the deficit climbs to
$947,000 at schools with football. Losing
that kind of m oney would put a big strain
on o ther program s around here. It costs a
lot to run a football program and the
attendance at the D-II level isn’t high
enough to offset the cost.
2. Students d o n ’t support the successful
program s we have now. Why would they
support a football team that would get
ham m ered in its first few years.
3. E ven if students do show up, they get
in free. So SIU E would have to com pete
with the St. Louis Cardinals, Rams, Blues,
th eater and other events for the local
entertainm ent dollar.
4. A football game tears up the field and
should not be played on the same field as
soccer. Even if football was played at our
stadium , there aren’t enough locker or

show er facilities down at the field to
accom m odate two team s of eighty people.
So team s would have to bus back and
forth from the field to the VC. This is
inconvenient for players, and would put
out people who w ant to use th e VC
showers and d o n ’t care about football.
So what do we do? I t’s Hom ecom ing
w eekend and there is no football. L et me
suggest that the parking lot under the
trees next to the soccer field is a good
place to tailgate. There will be two games
on Saturday and th at should give you
enough time to fire up the grill and start
the m errim ent. While you’re at the m en’s
soccer game look for M att Little. H e was
an All-Am erican last year and will run
over anyone in his path to the goal.

RACE
from page 14

Casey m ade the team when she
finished sixth in a race held this
past sum m er in Springfield.
“I was sixth across the finish
line, but actually third of those
eligible to com pete for a spot
on the team ,” Casey said. To
qualify for a place with the
Illinois team , runners have to
be residents of Illinois or a
border-state city.
The Japan Sea Rim Ekiden
race consists of seven legs of
various lengths, each run by a
m em ber of individual teams.
Twenty-three o th er team s will
be com peting in th e run
rep resen tin g C hina, Japan,
Russia, and South Korea. The
race follows a scenic course
along th e Sea of Japan and is
b ro ad cast live on Japanese
national television.
Casey
began
running
competitively only four years
ago, beginning as a student
here at SIUE.
“I ’d n ever really thought
much about it before then,”
said Casey. “ B ut the SIU E
cross-country team was in need
of runners, and I thought, ‘Well,
I ’ll give this a try.’”
A dm itting th at when she
began she was a “very, very
slow runner,” she found that
she enjoyed running and
co ntinued
to
com pete
following her graduation. Over
time, her times and finishing
positions in races around the
region im proved. “Now,” Casey
says, “ I ru n everyw here.
Through Edwardsville, around
the SIU E campus, down the
bike trails.”
The SIU E adm inistrator will
be taking tim e away from her
duties as a co o rd in a to r for
p o ten tial
and
incom ing
transfer students to travel to
Japan.
“The w hole trip is a
whirlwind,” Casey said. “We
leave here on Wednesday, Oct.
14, arrive in Japan on Thursday
local time, and start right in on
w elcom ing
and
opening
cerem onies, becom e fam iliar
with the race course, practices,
and then the race is on Sunday.
T here’s a ‘Sayonara P arty’ that
sam e evening, and th en it’s
back on th e plane th e next
m orning for hom e.”

you to look for Lindsay Rust
because you can’t miss her. She
leads the team in kills and digs
per game. My sermon is now
over.

put the Cougars in the driver’s
seat with a 2-0 lead.
By th e tim e SIU E had

M issouri-Rolla had a total of
tw o shots on goalkeeper
Shannon Roth.
M egan Beagles closed the

65th m inute when she found
the back of the net to give her
three goals on the season.
T he C ougars m ore than
tripled M issouri-R olla’s shot
total in the 3-0 victory.
Friederich scored twice for
S IU E w hen it faced the
U niversity of M issouri-St.

Less than 10 minutes into

the board.
K arin Tighe m ade it 2-0 at
the 35:22 m ark w hen she
