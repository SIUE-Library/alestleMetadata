Two slate senators meet

Wayne Kimler, a Junior in the Music Department, practices his classical guitar work as
Makena Gray, freshman, left, and Dave Easley, a freshman music major, enjoy his
efforts.

Illinois state Sens. Evelyn
Bowles and Vince Dem uzio
recently gave SIUE students a
talk aimed at getting them more
interested in politics.
The senators came to
campus as part o f the Student
Leadership Development Course
through the Kimmel Leadership
Center.
The
two
dow nstate
D em ocrats spoke to students
about the difficulty of getting
elected. Because they
are
Southern Illinois Dem ocrats,
they were not endorsed by their
party when they first sought
election. They were considered

anti-machine Democrats, the two
said, because they were not
affiliated with the Democratic
political machine, which is based
in Chicago.
Both senators said they
consider themselves to be grass­
roots politicians and said they
worked their way into the Illinois
Legislature from the outside.
D em uzio’s talk was also
aimed at the horrors o f campaign
funding. “Money is the m other’s
milk of politics,” he said.
Bowles spoke o f how she ran
a campaign on very little money.
She spray-painted clothespins
white and w rote, “Vote for
Evelyn,” on them. This simple
tactic worked, she said.

Fitness Center construction begins
BY ANTHONY WATT
NF.WS STRINGER
Fitness will reach new
heights at the Vadalabene Center.
Construction is under way
on a 4,100-square-foot addition
that will increase the size of the
weight training room and allow
for new exercise equipment.
“What w e’d expect is that it

would allow us to service more
people”
said
M ichael
J.
Ostrander, director of campus
recreation. “It would certainly
alleviate
the
overcrow ding
problem we currently have.”'
Approximately 500 people
use the Student Fitness Center
daily and 38 percent o f the
activities take place in the weight

training room.
The $600,000 project is
expected to be completed in April
1999.
E.W.R. A ssociates Inc. of
Swansea designed the project and
the SIU Board o f Trustees
approved it in A ugust. The
construction contract went to
H.K. Rule of Caseyville and the
work began Sept. 28.

At th is bookstore,you’11 fin d bloodsuckers under ‘B’
BY JIM DALTON
COLUMNIST
I couldn’t procrastinate any
longer. My teacher had been
warning us all w eek that we
should expect a quiz over the

supplem ental text. You know,
those books you have to buy at
the bookstore. The ones that cost
a sm all fortune and are
m ysteriously unavailable at
textbook rental.
G rabbing m y checkbook,

credit card and $50, I ventured
over to the University Center. I
arrived just as the bookstore was
opening. The large metal security
gate that protects the books at
night was slowly creeping into a
slot in the ceiling. I smiled, this

much security had to be
unnecessary.
“We have to make sure no
one gets out,” said a pale girl as
she guided the gate’s bars.
“Don’t you mean so no one
gets in?” I asked, wondering how

she knew what I was thinking.
“O f course ... that’s what I
meant,” said the girl, laughing as
if she had said something funny.
Although the girl had a pretty
face, it possessed an eerie,
anemic Ally McBeal quality.

Women’s Studies celebrates artists
at open house, will honor athletes
BY QIANA RANDALL
NEWS STRINGER
SIUE wom en art students
displayed their work in Peck Hall
during the first W om en’s Studies
open house of the academic year.
The
reception
was
spearheaded
by
M argaret
Simons, coordinator of W omen’s
Studies. “I enjoy helping talented
young w om en,” Sim ons said
Thursday.
The reception and open
house gave aspiring artists a
chance to have their w ork
displayed for the public.
“The reception is more of a
celebration for the artists, to let
them know that they are
appreciated,” Simons said. The

reception, which is held each
semester, was in a small room,
which helped promote a friendly
feeling.
Many different types o f art
were
displayed,
such
as
paintings, collages and prints.
“It’s nice that our artwork
can be displayed in this
building,” said Trish Bently, an
art student w hose collage of
charcoal, horsehair and chalk was
on display.
M elissa
W innesheik
displayed her painting of a regallooking woman with an owl in
front of her where her breasts
would be.
Another piece
o f art,
Telephone Poles Landscape, was
drawn by Rebecca Eilering to

show how cluttered the world is
with telephone poles.
This reception was a way of
supporting women artists.
Simons said there are also
plans to support w om en’s
athletics at SIUE, including
volleyball, basketball and soccer
events. The first of these
celebrations will take place Oct.
21 at the home volleyball game.
Everyone in W omen’s Studies is
allowed one guest. Pizza will be
served, and everyone will receive
a free T-shirt.
Simons has been with SIUE
for 22 years. She started as a
teacher and was prom oted to
coordinator last year. Simons was
noted in the New York Times for
her work.

Student petition drive seeks to put
gospel music on campus radio station
BY DANA MILES
NEWS STRINGER
Adrian Taylor Jr., leader of
Students Using Characteristics of
Christ to Endure Stressful
Situations, is prom oting a
petition to have gospel music
played on W SIE, the campus
radio station.
Taylor went to the station to
pursue air time for a gospel music
show. Because W SIE is a jazz
station, his request was turned
down.
Taylor said he feels students
on this campus should have more
opportunities
to
express
themselves through the school’s
station. Taylor said he is not
trying to be forceful in any way.
His only intention is “to broaden
W SIE’s horizon specifically for
the students of this cam pus.”
Tom Dehner, news director
at WSIE, said that although the
radio station is located on campus

Her facial bones seemed to
be trying to protrude through her
chalk-white skin.
Strolling past her, I went to
the back to where the class books
are organized alphabetically.
Although I squinted at the labels,
I could barely read them.
“Hey, aren’t you guys gonna
turn on the lights back here?”
“Well, w e’re not really open
yet.” Turning back to the shelves,
I didn’t notice the girl lower the
metal bars and lock them to the
floor.
I eventually located my
book. The price listed under my
200-page paperback novel was
$17.95.
“Are you kidding me? This
book only costs $5 at B. Dalton.
You guys are a bunch of
bloodsuckers.”

and does cover campus news and
special events, it is not just a
cam pus station. The station
serves the St. Louis market area,
the 18th-largest m arket in the
country.
Frank Akers, W SIE general
manager, said the station is
lim ited to playing only jazz
music.
“It makes sense in a major
market such as St. Louis for a
music station to play that one
type of music. That is what other
stations do whether they happen
to
be
com m ercial
or
noncommercial,” Akers said.
Akers said the situation
involving gospel m usic has
nothing to do with input from the
students or the university but
w ith
rules
controlling
government-assisted entities such
as SIUE and W SIE radio, which
require a separation of church
and state.
The girl, who stood behind
the counter, threw her head in my
direction and glared at me with
cold, dead eyes. H er expression
was one of shock and rage, as if I
had revealed some ugly truth that
no one talked about. “You know,”
she growled in low, grizzly voice.
“Huh? Know what? I was
ju st ... um m ... jo k in g .” I
sw allow ed hard
and tried
unsuccessfully to sm ile. The
girl’s bleached eyes were still
locked on me, and she began to
make a hissing sound.
Even from the distance, I
noticed the change. Two of her
upper canine teeth jutted farther
out of her gums until they were 3inch spikes. V iolently shaking
her head, the g irl’s teeth sliced at
the air. She ju m p ed onto the
counter and squatted like a dog.
A deadly smile stretched across
her face and she punctured her
bottom lip with those dagger-like

“W hile we theoretically
could switch to another form of
music, especially if it made sense
from a business and university
standpoint, gospel could not be
one we switch to,” Akers said.
However, there is light at the
end of the tunnel; Akers said
WSIE radio would be happy to
work with students to come up
with ways to help develop
programs the students may enjoy
more than jazz. That can be done
with student input and money.
“It’s a very interesting
situation for me, because I am a
very committed Christian,” Akers
said. “I speak in probably 10 to
20 churches every year. I am
involved in a lot o f Christian
activities.”
At the same time, Akers said
he understands the need for the
state to keep from sanctioning a
religious point of view.

of events to come, she licked the
trickle of blood from her lip and
returned her murderous gaze to
me.

I
bumped into a bookshelf, causing
a waterfall o f dusty volumes to
crash to the floor. Catching my
balance, I stood m otionless
between two rows of overpriced
books. I desperately tried to think
of something to do, somewhere
to run, but my mind nervously
fumbled.
Without warning, a 10-foot
stretch of the floor in front of me
fell open like a trap door. A mist
of stale, dead air rose from the
dungeon and invaded my lungs.
Although the repugnant air
brought tears to my eyes, I could
still see into the unlit cell beneath
the floor. I saw lines of closed
coffins and piles o f mangled
bodies that appeared to have been

sucked dry of all blood and color.
I saw other horrors, atrocities so
terrifying that I still can’t bring
myself to speak of them.
Instinctively I ran to the exit,
but found the metal sheet locked
to the floor. Clutching the metal
grille, I started to yell for help,
but a jarring blow forced the
wind out o f me. I crashed to the
ground and the female Dracula
wrapped herself around my back.
As she vainly attempted to bite
my neck, I wildly flung my head
back and forth, slamming the rear
of my skull against her.
When her hold on me began
to weaken I reached behind me,
grabbed a handful of hair and
flung her bony body over my
shoulder. Seizing my opportunity
to escape, I ran toward the store’s
last available exit, the glass
display case.
Sprinting to freedom , I
didn’t look back, but could feel
the girl close behind me. I shut

my eyes and jum ped into the
pane of glass which shattered, as
did the second. I fell to the
ground with a shattering crunch,
and little jagged pieces of glass
instantly stabbed into my legs,
arms, chest and face.
Lifting m yself out of this bed
of broken glass, I hobbled toward
the UC doors. The girl started to
pursue me, but was halted by the
bath of early morning light that
poured through the glass doors.
In a state o f shock, I
thoughtlessly carried m yself
across the Quad to Peck Hall.
The class collectively gasped as I
limped into the room and took a
seat in the back. After I sat in this
groggy stupor for a few seconds,
the teacher strolled in.
“I hope no one had any
trouble getting the additional
novel from the B ookstore,”
announced the teacher as I passed
out at my desk.

Tommy University
My family won’t buy no-name toilet paper, but will
purchase a pair of no-name tennis shoes. 1 don’t own a
Perry Ellis or a Tommy Hilfinger anything. The few brandname items I do own were purchased from Marshall’s (a
sort of resale outlet store) or were bought for the 75 percent
discounted price. Quality toilet paper has always been
more important than whether we have a coat with
“Tommy” written across the back of it in big, bright red
letters. After all, Charmin doesn’t put “Charmin'' in big
pink letters on the tissue.
I'm not very impressed by brand-name clothing. It only tells me
one of two things about you: “Hello, I am wearing this because this is
the style and I can afford it,” or “Hello, I am wearing this because this
is the style and I can’t afford it but don’t want to look like I can’t.”
Here at SIUE, we are all college students. The majority of us are
broke yet every day I walk around campus and see a fashion show.
Before I came to college, I thought college students walked around
dressed like unmade beds and that as long as you weren’t naked you
were fine. That was what I had seen on other campuses. When I came
here freshman year, I wore sweat pants almost every day only to look
up one day and notice how everyone else was “branded” from head to
toe. I saw at least five people who had a complete Tommy Hilfinger
outfit including the pants, shoes and socks, along with the jacket, hat
and shirt. Half of the girls I saw had hair that was perfectly coifed and
nails that were brightly done and fake. In the winter, SIUE turned into
a virtual Wilson leather coat store as everyone had the same black or
brown leather coat.
I felt strange because I thought college would let me finally escape
such walking advertisements. I spent the latter half of my adolescence
at Hazelwood Central in North St. Louis County and rode the dreaded
“Barrington Downs” bus, where if you didn’t have name-brand boots
you were ridiculed. I'm actually from Barrington Downs, a middleclass neighborhood where everyone feels the need to get everything
bigger and better than everyone else. I really didn’t fit in, but these
were high school students who got their clothing from their parents or
through their after-school jobs. Here I’m dealing with college students
who can’t always pay their parking tickets and tuition but have a
DKNY purse.
Now, I’m not going to knock anyone for wearing brand-name
clothes because I wouldn’t want anybody knocking me just because I
normally don’t wear those types of clothes. But in many cases,
especially for several of my friends, they can’t even pay their car note
or get a parking sticker. They try to tell me that they buy brands for the
“quality” but you can go to any department store and buy lesser known
brands of equal quality and lower price. Therefore it was never the
quality; it was the name. I believe that if Tommy Hilfinger put his name
on jock straps, plastic cups and seat covers someone would buy them.
After all, it’s not like he has to spend hours thinking up the design. All
he has to do is take a regular jock strap/seat cover/cup and write
“Tommy” in really big letters down the crotch/cover/cup and someone
will be cruising in a Dodge Neon with a designer jock strap in the gym
bag, sitting on the limited edition interior seat covers and drinking out
of a Hilfinger plastic cup.
After all, I know a guy selling people Tommy Hilfinger watches
and Tommy Hilfinger doesn’t make watches. And I know people who
wear Tommy key chain necklaces and Hilfinger doesn’t make those
either. Neither the watches nor the key chains could have been that socalled brand quality but the items were definitely bought for the name.
And some of my broke friends would buy these things just so they
don’t look broke.
I think I shall continue to wear my limited edition Sperry jacket. I
don’t know who Sperry is, but he didn’t put his name in big letters
across the back, nor in bright colors. He’s good and inconspicuous, just
the way I like ’em.

Letter to the E d ito r --------The parking paradox
continues

Mark, maybe, but Sammy
didn’t miss a thing.

My quest for a parking space
is a disaster. I’m still driving
through P Lot without hope.
I paid my tuition and the
school gave me books, but I paid
for a parking sticker and all I got
was an ulcer. Am I alone here?
I stalk fellow students
around the lot. Females watch
warily and dart between aisles
when I creep behind them. Other
people reach their cars only to
remove som ething. They stay
parked.
I
begin
to
suspect
conspiracy. T here m ust be a
coalition
know n
only
to
themselves as “The Permanently
Parked.”
They probably marry, get
jobs and raise families in their
parking space.
If I took their kids to day
care, typed their papers, and held
a barbecue, I wonder if they
would let me join.

In response to the article by
Andy K orbesm eyer’s article:
Sosa
m issed
chance
for
immortatility.
First of all I must commend
your ability to look up facts,
because being a Cardinal fan, I’m
surprised that you knew where
Lou Brock and Greg Maddux
developed their talents. I can’t
help it that Cubs management
decided to get rid o f these
superstars, but then again,
management seems to be pretty
ignorant these days.
Speaking of Ignorance, your
comment about Sosa missing a
chance for immortality was dead
wrong. In fact, by looking at the
1998 season it may bye Mr.
McGuire that losses his mortality.
In just the same way Roger Maris
lost his.
With the way baseball is
going. For Exam ple: tighter
wound
baseballs,
better
technology, legal body enhancing
drugs, 70 homeruns may be 3rd
or 4th best 10 years down the
road. Who knows?
But one thing I do know

E. J. Gallo

Mass Communications

Sosa, if he wins MVP, which he
will, will never have that taken
away from him. I’m sorry for all
the Cardinal fans that had to sit
and watch all 70 of those home
runs and then see someone else
win the MVP. But I guess that's
what happens when you can hit
66 homeruns, get over 150 RBI’s
and bat .308. I ’m sorry that
McGuire could only beat one(l)
of those numbers. OH! by the
way, M cGuire has how many
stolen bases?
Another thing that can’t be
taken away from Sammy for his
entire life is that he led his team
to the post-season.
And if the Braves take them
in (3) games, so be it. It’s just like
a Cardinal fan to pick the
negatives out of such a positive
season for the Cubs.
So remember what I said,
M cGuire’s record can be broken,
but you can not take away a MVP
or a playoff birth. One more
thing: GO Cubs! and I hope the
Cardinals have a nice time on the
couches with their rem ote
controls and their dreams.

Report on student governm ent
BY JESSICA NEAL
for STUDENT GOVERNMENT
The Student Senate and
Executive Board have been
working hard behind the scenes
to make this university work.
Many issues were discussed in
our last Student Senate meeting.
The Student Senate o f SIUE
convened Friday, Sept. 25, in the
International Room of the Morris
University Center. Vice President
Ettrick Lucas called the meeting
to order at 2:30 p.m.
One issue under old business
had to do with the University
Center Com puter Lab in the
Student Organization Office D.
Center Director Mary Robinson
addressed the Senate to answer
questions
regarding
the
University Center Computer Lab.
Student Organization Advisory
Board Chair Tim Gross stated
that he checked the office several
times and no one was using it.
Student Body President Bill
Anderson sent out memos as well
and received no response.

Senator Karl M ueller moved to
approve the request that Office D
be changed into a computer lab
for the University Center. The
motion passed.
Under new business, Senator
Ray Green moved to approve
many different items. The
following items were all passed:
Gamma Thêta U psilon travel
request to Honolulu; Student Art
Therapy
A ssociation
travel
request to Portland; and the
Sigma Phi Epsilon program
request for Judge M itch Crane on
Nov. 10.
Another item discussed
during the meeting dealt with the
petitioning
organization,
Foundation of Christ. Federal
Regulations pertaining to the
required
nondiscrim ination
clause as outlined in Title IX of
the Education Amendments are
as follows:
No person in the United
States shall, on the basis of sex,
be excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under

any education program or
activity
receiving
federal
assistance.
Members o f Foundation of
Christ
acknow ledged
this
particular clause, yet did not want
to use the nondiscrim inatory
clause based on university
guidelines, which are as follows:
This organization and its
programs and activities shall be
available to all interested
students without regard for race,
color, sex, creed, religion,
national origin, age, sexual
orientation, handicap or other
factors covered by the law.
The organization contended
that the university guidelines
were a m isinterpretation of
federal
guidelines.
Student
Organization A dvisory Board
Chair Gross recommended to not
approve the Foundation of Christ
constitution. The m otion was
passed.
Senator Green m oved to
adjourn the m eeting. Senator
Mueller seconded. The meeting
was adjourned at 3:22 p.m.

Ultra-popular proto-rock band Hootie and the Blowfish in concert. One of the great
success stories of the ’90s, Hootie carries on its tradition of catchy bubble-gum pop
while expanding its musical horizons with new instrumentation.
Photo by Atlantic Records

BY CORY PITT
FOR THE ALESTLE
Since their explosion on the
pop music scene in 1994, Hootie
and the Blowfish have made as
many enem ies as they have
friends and fans. C onsidering
they are about as friendly a band
as can possibly exist, much o f the
criticism is unfounded.
The band, nam ed for the
nicknames of two o f lead vocalist
Darius Rucker’s college buddies,
has never m ade innovative,
thought-provoking or com plex
m usic. T heir h it songs have
received excessive radio airplay.
The band m em bers look like
plain, ordinary guys, not rock
stars. They even sponsor a
national golf tournam ent which
is, for the average rock band, a
little uncharacteristic.
Judging from their latest

album, “M usical Chairs,” Hootie
has chosen to blow off all the
criticism , and stick to what
established them as one of the
biggest success stories o f the
‘90s.
Ever since their
debut
album ,
“Cracked Rear View,”
which sold over 14
million copies, Hootie
made their mark as a
lighthearted,
radiofriendly rock ’n ’ roll
band
with
tight
background
vocal
h a r m o n i e s
accompanying
R ucker’s rough but
soulful singing style.
Their second album,
the
triple-platinum
“ F a ir w e a th e r
Johnson,”
brought

m ore o f the sam e and many
critics predicted Hootie would
disappear as fast as they rocketed
to stardom.
“Musical Chairs” is not an

album that will turn the masses of
critics into believers. The album
rolls along with 13 tracks that
will remind listeners of previous
efforts from the first two releases.
H ootie will undoubtedly
continue to assault the radio
airwaves with tracks such as
“Wishing,” “Las Vegas Nights”
and “One By One.” Many of
these
songs
include
the
harmonious choruses Hootie is
famous for, those catchy little
lines that leave listeners singing
the words all day long, whether
they want to or not.
There are also some real
gems on “M usical Chairs,”
including “D esert M ountain
Showdown,” which could only be
described as a “ditty.” The jangle
of acoustic guitars over the group
harmony makes this track stand
out as a Cajun-style, Allman
Brothers-meets-The Beatles kind
of song. It is fun, probably just
something the band did for kicks
and grins, but the mood really
comes through.
On another song, “Only
Lonely,” Rucker sings, “I spend
my nights imagining your face,

your touch, then I realize I don’t
even know your name.” Although
innocent and a little confusing, it
was these types of lyrics that
made up some of the band’s
biggest singles, such as “Let Her
Cry” and “Only Wanna Be With
You.”
The band does not simply
put new spins on previous songs,
however. There is some degree of
experimentation here with efforts
such as “M ichelle Post,” “W hat’s
Going on in H ere” and the
opening song of the album “I Will
Wait.” Many different kinds of
instrum entation are featured
including
banjo,
mandolin,
violins, cellos and steel guitars,
which are not found much on
previous albums. Although they
sway a little, these songs manage
to stay on the same road that
H ootie’s m usic has always
traveled.
M aybe this is why many
critics lash out at Hootie and the
Blowfish. M usic is constantly
changing and popular music does
not sound the same today as it did
10 or even five years ago.
However, there is something to
be said for a band which
sticks to their style as
opposed to some that fall
flat trying to break their
musical boundaries.
H ootie
is
as
straightforward and honest
as
rock
m usic
gets.
“Musical Chairs” will not
get H ootie a seat in the
collection o f those who
disliked the other albums,
nor will it turn heads that
were not looking in their
direction already.
However, for the rest of
us the usual will do just fine.

Kid Rock with Twister Brown
Warren Brothers "Guilty” of
Tucker splices rap and hard rock bland country retreads
BY KELLY SPARKS
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
Like most alternative rap CDs, Kid Rock’s “Devil Without a Cause” is a CD where
every track offers something different. There is a selection to fit every mood or scenario
one may be in. You may recognize the track “I am the Bullgod,” on this CD. This selection
is played on 105.7 FM The Point.
Kid Rock, along with his team called Twister Brown Tucker, perform reggae, oldschool rap and alternative music throughout the CD. The lead track, “I am the Bullgod,”
shows much mixing between rap and metal. This is a popular combination in the new
music scene. Some songs on this CD are mainly associated with heavy metal. For all you
heavy metal fans out there, you can find Kid Rock’s “Bawitdaba” on the free Korn CD
that came with K orn’s latest release.
“Devil W ithout a Cause” loses steam with stoner throwaways like “Wasting Time”
and “Som ebody’s G otta Feel This.” But when the raps drag, Kid’s style changes to a slow,
twangy song called “Only God Knows Why,” which does not even sound like it belongs
on this CD. Then there are other selections such as “Welcome 2 The Party (Ode 2 The Old
School)” and “Cowboy,” that remind you of old-school rap.
These boys have already made themselves heard almost overnight. W ho know s?
M aybe next y e a r w e w ill be seeing them at O zzfest ‘99.

BY KELLY SPARKS
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
There is no question that the Warren Brothers have had many past
experiences in the love department.
Their new CD, “Cold Cruel World,” is repetitive with typical sob stories
about relationships. The Warren Brothers are newcomers on the country music
scene with their recent single, “Guilty.” If you are a country music fan, you can
find this song on KIX 106 or catch the video on Country Music Television.
The Warren Brothers’ lead and harmony vocals are performed by Brad and
Brett Warren. Along with the other musicians, they offer a talented blend of
music and vocals. However, they have no distinctive style to set them apart
from any other new country music artist. Even though they have an exceptional
sound, I found m yself bored and detached while listening.
This CD features the song “Guilty,” which is an upbeat song about an
unexpected love. Other songs such as their title track “Cold Cruel World,”
“Surviving Emily” and “Just Another Sad Song” are nothing but more sad
songs about love experiences. If you are the pillow-talk type, then this is a good
addition to your music collection. If not, I suggest my favorite love song,
“Bitch” by Sevendust.

The hom e run b arrag e is over. T here
will be no m ore celeb ratin g , no m ore
standing o vations and n o m o re at-bats. I
cannot check th e box scores in the papers
everyday because th e C a rd in a l’s season is
over. T he re c o rd e n d s at 70, w ith no
chance for 71. A t least n o t until n ext year.
The questio n is w hat can be done to
relieve P ost M cG w ire S y n d ro m e until
A pril w hen Big M ac a n d th e C ardinals
open th e 1999 season? W ell, th e re is no
true cure fo r the PM S This sickness will
affect all kinds o f p eople, young and old,
m ale and fem ale.

H ow can w e all n o t fe el a little
sinking feeling in o u r stom ach? M illions
all o v er th e w o rld follow ed M ark
M cG w ire as he bash ed hom e runs from

packed Busch Stadium to w atch a ra th e r
lousy baseball team for the chance to
w itness o n e -se v en tie th o f th e am azing
new hom e run record.
We laughed as Big M ac m issed first
base after hitting his 62nd. We cried tears
of joy as he hoisted his son high after
sm ashing th e rec o rd . H e ck , we e v en
c h e e red w h en Sam m y Sosa, his rival,
closed

on
M c G w ire’s

St. Louis, as well as the rest o f A m erica,
was w rapped up in the hom e ru n chase
and could n o t get enough.
N ow w e a re all faced w ith P ost
M cG w ire Syndrom e. So w hat can we do
ab o u t it? I have com e up with a few

People find profound meaning in their suffering.
When faced with so much loss as well as their own impending death,
a spirituality emerges as well as remarkable courage to be present with pain.
One person’s story
of living and dying from AIDS
is told at his request through images and journals,
and through the art therapist’s experience as witness to his process.
