University gets tough on students
Belck, referring to students who come forward now.
Belck and SIUE President Ted Sanders said plea
bargaining would be an option for students willing to

E.T. phoned home and he must have charged the call
to SIUE because the university’s phone bill remains out
of this world — an estimated $1.1 million.
From October 1993 until September 1995,
approximately 1,500 students living on campus used a
special sequence o f numbers to charge their long
distance telephone calls to the university.
One call was to Brazil so a student could hear a
national soccer game being played on the radio. One
student had charges for nine cents and the largest
outstanding charge was an international bill o f $45,000.
Students were given from December until March 1
to confess their sins and avoid prosecution. Around
1,025 students admitted their wrongdoing during the
amnesty period and paid a total o f $416,000.
Meanwhile, 475 other students have not admitted
their part in the phone scam and now face prosecution.
At a news meeting on Wednesday, SIUE Chancellor
Nancy Belck said that she would rather not see students
receive criminal records, but she declared that amnesty
was over.
“I cannot guarantee the same set o f conditions,” said

"V ie w ill not w aiver

cooperate with the police.
According to Sam Smith, University News Services
director, charges below $300 are considered a Class A
misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison and a
$ 1,000 fine.
“Police are keeping a pretty tight lid on the
investigation,” he said.
Chief Charles McDonald, of the university police
department, said a charge over $300 is a simple felony
punishable with 5 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine.
McDonald said the department has been working on

the investigation for a year and “we now feel we have
enough information to question students.”
Detective Scott Evers o f the Edwardsville Police
Department, is assisting campus police in their
investigation. “I’ve interviewed 30 to 40 people (since
interviewing has begun),” he said.
Belck said the school is using two criteria in targeting
students: those with some of the largest bills and those
with the most evidence against them.
Sanders was not sure how the school would handle
cases against former foreign students.
He said
extradition would not be possible for phone fraud.
Administrative sanctions would include withholding
students’ transcripts, probation or dismissal. Most
likely, this action would hinder graduation or job
placement for these students, he said.
The two employees responsible for paying the
university telephone bills during that time period are no
longer working for SIUE. One resigned and the other
was fired.
The university has not paid the $1.1 million
telephone debt entirely. According to Belck, payments
are being made to the Illinois Department of Central
Management Services as the money is paid to the school
by the students involved.

letter to the e d ito r _______________ _____________________________________________________________________________________

Tired of being punished by the university and ready to hit the road
Since this is my last sem ester at SIU E, I thought
I might as well raise a few complaints that I’ve been
thinking about recently. It probably w on’t help
things, but it definitely can’t m ake things worse.
First of all, I want to know the purpose of having
a com puter lab in the Commons Building at Tower
Lake. O f course, the obvious purpose is to provide
students with com puters so they can work on
papers and other projects. Unfortunately, as anyone
who has attem pted to use this facility will testify, it
is virtually im possible to o btain one of the
com puters in the lab. M ost of the time there is a
wait of at least 15 minutes. This is because there are
only eight com puters in the lab and there are almost
1000 students who currently reside in Tower Lake.
This figure comes out to be one com puter for
every 125 residents, which is absolutely absurd! The
lab is supposed to be a service to the residents of
Tower Lake, but actually it becomes m ore of an
inconvenience. With the 15 m inute wait, students
must wait at the facility until a com puter becomes
available. M ost students, myself included, don ’t
have 15 m inutes to waste waiting for a com puter
that may or may not becom e available; this can be
both frustrating and a waste of our precious time.
We do, however, have the opportunity to go up to
campus to use one of the labs there, but we should
be able to use the com puters that are close to our
apartm ents, since I am sure we are paying to have
the service in the first place. I d on’t see why there
can’t be m ore com puters placed in Tower Lake so

that m ore can be made available to the students
who need to use them. A fter all, what is the use in
having a lab if the majority of students can’t even
use it?
Also, I ’m curious as to why the police
departm ent has hired all of these new officers. In a
recent Alestle, it was reported that the reason
behind this was the new bike patrol. I certainly hope
that the bike patrol is able to reduce the am ount of
crime on campus because the current force is
obviously not doing much in the way of curbing and
com batting crime. A nyone read the Police B eat
lately? There are always people listed in the beat as
victims of crimes, mostly theft.
H as there been anything done about these
crim es? No. “ Police are continuing their
investigation”. W hat exactly does “ Police are
continuing their investigation” m ean anyway? From
personal experience, it means the police are doing
nothing. Last year, my room m ate had her phone
card stolen by a previous room m ate and called the
police for help. The police in turn took on her case
and she never heard from them again. O f course,
she called on a regular basis for a while to see if
anything new had occurred with her case, but the
only input she received was that the “police are
continuing their investigation”.
This incident was over a year ago now, and has
not received either her money or any word from the
police, probably never will. This crime as well as
countless others should have been cleared up long

ago. In my room m ate’s case, the police had both the
address and the phone num ber of the perpetrator
and since she d o esn ’t live th at far from
Edwardsville, could have easily taken her in for
questioning and had this m atter cleared up right
away.
Lastly, I would like to address the U niversity’s
new phone system. I realize that the university has
been strapped with a large debt over the phone
scandal that occurred early last year, but it seems
that the money could come from som ewhere else. It
doesn’t really seem fair, as one reflects on the
m atter that the only places that we can call now are
Edwardsville/Glen C arbon, A lton and some parts
of East St. Louis. We can’t even call Maryville, and
that is five m inutes away! I feel sorry’for the people
who live nearby and can’t even call their families
without paying for it. I am also upset to think of all
of the students who were not involved in the phone
scandal and who did not even attend this university
who are now being punished by having to pay to
call their parents who live a m ere 16 miles away. It
just seems like the students keep being punished,
from Pepsi-Cola to M CT the students are the ones
who have to pay the consequences. I w onder when
it will finally stop.
I’m glad that I ’m leaving at the end of the
semester, because I’m tired of being punished and
I’m sure that m ost people are too.

“ Dead Spy Report”

Craig Ross, up to now know n for

released a debut CD, “Dead Spy Report.”
Ross is part of that select group of
musical artists who whip up music in their
garages and basem ents (Johnny Polonski,
Haydn, et al.) instead of playing every
honky tonk and Shakey’s Pizza on the
way to the top. Ross has cranked out a
curious, personal album.

Tennis has tough weekend
without their No. 1 player
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
Throughout the whole preseason
the S IU E w om en’s tennis team was
looking forw ard to having a very good
one-tw o punch.
But when the Cougars hosted a
GLVC cluster this past w eekend they
had to play with just one punch.
“W e’re waiting for Y utaka(Izutsu)
to be cleared by the N C A A . It’s a
slow process and we didn’t get the
papers in till August and they are
backlogged over there,” head coach
Bill Logan said M onday afternoon.
Going into the w eekend, Izutsu was
penciled in as the C ougars N o .l
player. Since she could no t play,
everyone had to move up.

Freshm an Sarah H ardim on stepped
up to take the challenge at N o.l and
went 2-1 over the weekend.
As a team th e C ougars b eat
K entucky W esleyan in th eir first
m atch but then fell in their next two
outings to S outhern In d ian a and
Bellarmine.
“T he girls played all right against
Kentucky W esleyan but I knew we
w ere in ho t w ater with S outhern
Ind iana and B ellerm ine, which we
beat last year, but both team s had
their sam e team s back from last sea­
son and they w ere pretty good then,”
Logan said.
Missing their No. 1 player didn’t
help either, Logan added.
The Cougars played both team s
well but fell in some closely played
matches.

Volleyball begins GLVC play
going 1-2 over the weekend
From SIUE sports Information
Finding a positive to com plete the
w eekend, th e S o u th ern Illinois
University at E d wards ville volleyball
team defeated the Lady Knights of
Bellarm ine 13-15, 15-10; 10-15, 15-11,
15-13 in
G re a t
L akes Valley
C onference A ction from R egents Hall
in Louisville, Ky.
This w eekend m arked the opening
of GLVC play for the Cougars, now 86 on th e year. B efore defeating
Bellarm ine, S IU E lost its conference
op en er to N o rthern Kentucky Friday
in H ighland Heights, Ky. The Cougars
also hooked up with 13th- ranked
G ran d Valley S tate at N o rth ern
Kentucky, falling to the Lakers 15-3,
15-12,15-5.
H ead coach Sandy M ontgom ery
said the Cougars need to have confi­
dence in their play.
“Against Bellarm ine, we played just
well enough to win and I’m glad we
won, but we d id n ’t play well all w eek­
end,” M ontgom ery said. “If we play to
our potential, we can play with any
team successfully, but we have to re a l­
ize o u r potential.”
A g ainst B ellarm ine, sophom ore

M ichelle G ilm an led the SIU E charge
with 15 kills and 20 total blocks, 10
solos and assists. Senior Yvonne Welch
of P ekin com piled 17 kills on 54
attem pts and led the Cougars with 30
digs. Sophom ore Christy Scheller of
Belleville paced the SIU E attack with
42 assists. Freshm an Kim Gilm an of
Springfield and sophom ore Julie
L ittek en of Aviston had 12 blocks
apiece.
A s a whole, SIU E totaled 40.5 team
blocks (22 solos and 37 assists) and 112
digs. The Cougars put down 51 kills
with 28 errors on 194 attacks.
M ontgom ery said h er squad is p ro ­
gressing but it takes time.
“They have to un d erstan d , not
everything in a m atch is m apped out
for them , and they have to m ake reads
and adjust,” M ontgom ery said. “I think
we learned a lot this w eekend and it’s
still early in the season, so we will just
continue to grow and progress.”
SIU E sees m ore GLVC action next
w eekend as the C ougars face
W isconsin-Parkside Friday at 7 p.m. in
K enosha, Wis. O n Saturday, S IU E
takes on conference foe Lewis and
Ferris State at 10:30 a.m. and 12:30
p.m., respectively, in Romeoville, 111.
