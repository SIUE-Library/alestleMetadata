By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
The S tudent Leadership D evelopm ent Program, along
with various other organizations, will be sponsoring a
program called “Everyone Belongs,” on Saturday, April
20, in the V adalabene Center.
The program is a part the SLD P’s Action Day “Multi­
c u ltu ra l Day,” a service-learning project and event for
fam ilies from Tower Lake and the U nited C hristian
F o u n d atio n Single P arents S upport G roup, Suzanne
K utterer-Siburt, assistant director of the SLDP, said.
The program gives families a chance to spend time
together, have fun, and recognize the families on campus,
K utterer-Siburt said.
Some o f the organizations that will be assisting in the
A ction D ay are: the A frican S tudent A ssociation,
A m ericorps, the Chinese Student Association, the Indian
Student Association, S.E.A.C. and the Interdisciplinary334 Environm ental Issues and Conflicts class.
The class, K utterer-Siburt said, taught by the biology

commentary

letter to the editor

Flota is still distorting the truth SIUE needs
to realign
their priorities

Once again, Mr. Flota has greatly distorted the
truth. H e claims that the U.S. economy is no longer
num ber one. H e still claims that the autom ation of
the U.S. econom y has led to increased
unem ploym ent in the last few decades. These
statem ents are totally not true.
First I will com pare the econom ies of Sweden,
Norway and D enm ark to the U nited States. Flota
claims that Sweden, Norway and D enm ark all have
higher National Products per capita than the U nited
States. The 1995 world fact book shows that in 1994,
Sweden’s real National Product was $18,580 per
capita. It also states that the National Products of
Norway and D enm ark were $22,170 per capita and
$19,860 per capita respectively. Now if the U nited
States’ per capita National Product is $25,850 per
capita, how can Mr. Flota m ake these claims?
Mr. Flota also fails to consider these countries’
high unem ploym ent num bers w hen he states
Sweden, N orw ay and D enm ark have b e tte r
economies than the US. As of 1994, Sweden, Norway
and D enm ark reported unem ploym ent rates of 8.8
percent, 8.4 percent and 12.3 percent respectively.
The U nited States has an unem ploym ent rate of 5.5
percent, yet F lota claims Sweden, N orw ay and
D enm ark are better off than we are.
Flota once again claims that the autom ation of the
United States economy has caused an increased over
the past few decades. This is totally untrue. In 1950
(before the inform ation age began), unem ploym ent
was 5.3 p ercent. Today, afte r 46 years of
“autom ation,” it is only 5.5 percent. Flota simply
does not realize that it takes hum an beings to make,
run and m aintain machines. If F lo ta’s autom ation
theory is correct, then underdeveloped countries
such as Bangladesh would be b etter off than the
United States. Bangladesh has a National Product
per capita of $1,040 which is not even close to the
United States.
L e t’s face it M r. F lota, the m ost pow erful
economies in the world are those which are free.
Consider the very capitalistic economy of Hong

Kong. This free economy has a National Product per
capita of $24,530 and an unem ploym ent rate of 1.9
percent.The truth is many countries do not com pare
to the U nited States because they do not use
m achinery and computers.
Mr. Flota has also stated that I “dismiss the
concerns of the middle class.” I wduld be a fool to
dismiss the concerns of the middle class because that
is where I come from. I understand that change can
be traum atic, but I also realize people can and do
adapt to different situations. W hen people lose their
jobs, they may need to learn a new trade o r move to
a new location. That is simply the way life goes
sometimes. I know from my own experiences that
life is not always a bowl of cherries.
Mr. Flota accuses conservatives of believing all
governm ent is bad. This is not true. I have never
stated that there should be no federal governm ent or
welfare state. I am against extrem ely high taxes and
federal regulations that rob people of their liberties.
I am against Socialism and Communism because
these econom ic policies do not allow people to buy
and sell the products they want. Mr. Flota has
accused me of insensitivity because I believe people
should earn their money. W hat is so wrong with that
idea, Mr. Flota? Some people work harder and
produce m ore and therefore should m ake m ore
money.
In conclusion, Mr. Flota, I would like to ask how
your socialistic policy would preserve the freedom to
spend m oney as we choose? How can high taxation
preserve that choice? Obviously you do not realize
that taxes are not contributions or gifts to the poor.
They are forced. That does not represent freedom .

P.S.— Conservatives like myself cannot control the
m oron who bom bed the O klahom a City building
just like left wing environm entalists do not inspire
idiots like the U nabom ber to blow up airplanes.

parking fees in
o rd er to pay for
the dam aged parking lots, as well as, the roads in
Tower Lake. However, is this fair to the students?
I believe if students should pay for the dam age
that has occurred to the parking lots and roads, it
is only fair that the university reim burse students
and faculty for the dam age done to cars that was
cause by the conditions of the parking lots and
roads. Thousands of dollars probably have been
spent to fix wheel alignm ents and repair tires this
winter. A nd even though som e o f the
Edwardsville areas are bad, SIU E has caused the
m ajority of dam age inflicted on cars and their
tires.
It was a noble deed for the university to fill in
the potholes in Tower Lake, but this was only
after the m ajority of the w inter was over with and
the dam age was complete. Even now, the repaired
holes will only last for so long.
Isn’t it only fair that our tuition-paying
students receive some type of benefits from the
university? So, instead of m aking students pay for
damages, let the university do it.

Israel blames Iran and others blame Israel for Lebanon war
JE R U SA L E M (A P) —Israel blames Iran for the
new round of w arfare in Lebanon, saying its arming
of Islamic guerrillas in south Lebanon is part of a
larger scheme to thwart Middle E ast peace and
topple Prime M inister Shimon Peres.
But m any exp erts believe th at argum ent is
exaggerated or wrong. They contendthat Syria, not
Iran, is the power behind Hezbollah.
And still others believe Israel itself is at fault for
keeping troops in a buffer zone in south Lebanon
since 1985, providing a pretext for guerrilla attacks
on Israeli soldiers and towns.
For many Israelis, Iran ’s role is clear: “Hezbollah
is reporting to Iran, acting at Iran ’s behest. It is
trained and financed and inspired by Iran,” said Uri
Lubrani, the D efense M inistry’s chief policy adviser
on Lebanon and a form er am bassador to Iran.
According to Israeli estimates, Iran gives $80
million a year to H ezbollah, which can field 1,000 to
1,200 guerrillas. Peres recently announced that a ship
loaded with Iranian weapons for H ezbollah was
intercepted in Belgium.
Maj. Gen. M oshe Yaalon, head of Israel’s military
intelligence, told reporters at the outset of the
fighting that Iran was behind a broad terrorist

campaign that included suicide bombings in Israel by
the Islamic fundam entalist Hamas and Islamic Jihad
groups. Those attacks, in February and M arch, killed
63 people including four bombers.
“Since November, we see an effort by all the
terrorist groups instructed by Iran to carry out as
many attacks as possible,” Yaalon said. “ One of their
assum ptions is that a change of governm ent in Israel
will harm the peace process.”
O thers discount the focus on Iran.
“The problem has nothing to do with Iran or Syria or
w hether or not they have influence. The problem is
the occupation in south Lebanon,” said
R ashid K halidi, d irecto r o f the C en ter for
International Studies at the University of Chicago.
The potential for violence and terrorism will rem ain
until there is a peace between Israel on the one hand
and L ebanon and Syria on the other, said Khalidi, a
Palestinian who lived in B eirut during the 1982
Israel invasion.
H e and o th er experts believe the tim ing of
H ezbollah’s escalation of rocket attacks could well
be linked to Israel’s May 29 general election. Peres
faces right-wing Likud le.ader Benjamin N etanyahu,

who is expected to take a hard er line on trading land
for peace with Syria and the Palestinians.
A lfred A therton, the U.S. M ideast peace envoy
who helped negotiate the Egypt-Israel peace accord
in 1979, said he believed the Israeli elections were a
key factor in the calculations of both sides.
O n the one hand, Peres had to act in order to
reestablish his credibility at a time when his ratings
were sinking against N etanyahu’s.
O n the other, Islamic m ilitant opponents of P eres’
peacem aking w anted to see Peres lose the election
and believed terrorism would undercut support for
his policies.
“If you are looking for a m otivating factor on the
p art of the Iran ian s and th eir surro g ates in
H ezbollah and Ham as, th a t’s the one com m on
them e,” said
A therton, who heads the privately funded Search
For Com m on G round, a W ashington-based conflict
resolution group with program s in the M ideast.
Peres told reporters Tuesday after m eeting with
Jo rdan’s prim e m inister, Abdul-K arim Kabariti, that
Iran, m ore than Syria, was directing the attacks on
northern Israel.

C H A P E L HILL, N.C. (A P )—College offers a wealth of inform ation and learning to
youngsters, but when it comes to language skills, the really awesome stuff comes from fellow
students, not professors.
Professors “just don’t impinge on (students’) lives that m uch,” said linguist Connie Eble, who
has collected slang term s from her students for the past 25 years and docum ented them in a new
book. “Their interaction with their peers is much, much, m ore im portant than their interaction
with their teachers.”
Eble began soliciting slang to spice up her introductory English linguistics class at the
University of N orth Carolina at C hapel Hill and to dem onstrate to students how new words come
into our language.
Eventually, she m ade slang her research specialty. H er new book is “Slang & Sociability: InG roup Language Am ong College Students.”
The book describes both the classic—chill, awesome, Sorority Sue—and the obscure—“go for
sushi” (kiss passionately) and “You’re so tan I hate you, bye” (a farewell).
Although soliciting slang from students has been an effective collection m ethod, Eble is
alm ost apologetic about it.
She cautions that she may not have a representative sample of truly offensive slang—terms
that are racist or vulgar—because students may censor themselves.
The best way to collect slang, she says, would be spend time with students while they talk.
“The thing is, I’m so obviously not a peer,” she said. “They d o n ’t sit around and talk in slang with
a teacher old enough to be their m other.”
Mavis Gragg, a sophom ore from Black M ountain, told The C harlotte O bserver that her
m other has noticed the change in her vocabulary since she entered college. “My mom was like,
I don’t understand you now.”
E lbe’s book, which comes out this m onth, could help bridge the com m unication gap.
Since 1971, students have given her m ore than 10,000 3-by-5 index cards, each with a slang
word and definition.
Most she collected only once— evidence of the ephem eral nature of slang. But many words
have been offered by multiple students over num bers of years. The most frequent submission:
Sweet, m eaning superb, first subm itted in 1975 and still going after about 130 submissions.
Eble, who has been called the prem iere authority on college slang, outlines in the book how
and why college students use slang.
“The reasons are all social. It’s really to identify them selves with the people and the styles and
the values that they wish to identify themselves with,” she said.
Or, as sophom ore India Williams said: “It allows you to be relaxed. It’s not that we don’t know
the right words.”
With her new book, Eble said she’ll probably end her research.
“ 1 hope this book is a book that will m ean som ething to som ebody 200 years from now— to
see what the life of college students was like at the end of the 20th century,” she said.
While the subject m atter of college slang has rem ained fairly constant in recent years, Eble has
noticed one change.
“T hey’re simply not turning in slang term s for drugs anym ore.” No m ore “toke” to refer to
smoking m arijuana, or “sugar” for cocaine.”
She’s not sure why. Perhaps because some think drug use is increasingly taboo, students do n ’t
want to adm it to Eble they know such words. Perhaps drug use has decreased. O r maybe, she
said, the term s aren’t considered novel anymore.
And her favorite?
She has many, but she admits a soft spot for “Talk to R alph on the big white telephone.”
“It spawned so many term s relating to vom it.”

A IR FO R C E ACADEM Y , Colo. (A P )—A ir Force senior cadet Brian Bauman found a
family he never knew he had in Korea.
For his sister, Eun Sil Kim, it was a time o i joy and a time of sorrow: joy to find her halfbrother, sorrow to learn he was dying.
“This is a real em otional time. I t’s a bit overwhelming to m eet a family I never knew I had,”
Baum an said, Kim weeping quietly at his side.
Kim flew from Korea in hopes of being a suitable m arrow donor for Bauman, who was
diagnosed in O ctober with chronic m yelogenous leukem ia. W ithout a bone m arrow
transplant, he isn’t expected to live m ore than five years.
“I think it’s incredible. She has the courage to come to a foreign country where she doesn’t
speak the language ... it shows how much love a family has to have,” said Baum an, who grew
up in M innesota.
Kim cried and held B rian’s hand as Hyun Sook H an, an international adoption consultant,
translated during lunch together at the A ir Force Academ y cafeteria.
Through H an, Kim said she had to fight Asian cultural prohibitions against donating body
parts.
“ It used to be traditional and many people now do not believe in transplants,” she said.
“T h at’s not for me at this point. It’s wrong thinking.”
“This is my blood brother. I’m going to give no m atter w hat,” Kim said.
The two were separated when she was a teenager and Brian, now 21, a baby. She
recognized him in a docum entary on B rian’s plight that was shown in Korea.
“She knew that he existed and that he was adopted,” said Steve Baum an, B rian’s adoptive
father. While watching the show, she rem arked, “T hat looks like my brother.”
Initial tests show the two are a close m atch and further tests perform ed M onday were being
analyzed. Results are expected by the end of the week.
Baum an, 21, was born in South K orea and given up for adoption by his unwed mother. The
Baumans, then of St. Paul and later from Pine City, Minn., adopted him when he was 3.
Baum an said if his half-sister is not a match, he will keep looking. B ut now, he says, h e’s
learning about a family he never knew he had.
“I’m learning about my parents, I’m learning about my family,” he said. “It’s a roller coaster
of ups and downs.”

University system land deal illegal
HELEN A (AP)—Fifteen years of land sales and trades by the Board of Regents were illegal and
unconstitutional, but should be ratified to avoid the financial and legal turmoil of nullifying the deals, a
news report concludes.
Those involved in the transactions believed the state was acting properly and should not have to
suffer because that assumption proved wrong years later, Attorney General Joe Mazurek said in a
review given to the state Land Board on Monday.
He said that, “given the equitable interests of the dozens of individuals and corporations that have
acquired property interests from the regents,” the legislature should be asked to approve the deals.
The report, six months in the works, was requested by the Land Board amid a controversy
surrounding a land sale involving the University of M ontana and its fund-raising arm, the UM
Foundation.
UM had given the land to the foundation, which sold it to developers to create a scholarship fund.
Mazurek concluded last fall that transaction was illegal and the regents bought back the land for
$340,000 more than the developers paid.
The legal analysis, presented Monday by Assistant Attorney General George Schunk, found that the
regents had no constitutional or statutory authority to approve the eight exchanges and 23' sales
involving university system property between 1980 and 1995.
The affected state land totaled 2,200 acres worth $4.5 million.
LeRoy Schramm, attorney for the regents, criticized the report as based “dubious legal conclusions”
and “misleading.” The regents honestly believed they were acting within their legal power, he said.
The Land Board gave the regents until mid-July to respond to the report with their own legal analysis
of the land deals.
The board conducted no environmental studies, failed to give public notice for seven of eight
exchanges and 10 of the 23 sales, Schunk said. No appraisals were done in eight instances and, in at least
two cases, land was sold at less than its market value, he added.
Contrary to claims of the regents, they had no constitutional authority to dispose of state land until
the 1995 Legislature acted, Schunk said.
The board’s belief that getting full market value for land is the only necessity conflicts with the
constitutional mandate that land be held in the public trust, he said.
“The regents’ interpretation permits public lands to be sold in a private sale without notice to the
public,” he wrote.
The legislature is the only government body that can validate the illegal transactions, Schunk said.
Schramm said the conclusions in the attorney general’s report reverse a policy honored for 15 years.
The regents believed they had the power to approve land sales and trades because a 1980 letter from
the commissioner of state lands concluded the Land Board had no authority over an exchange involving
Montana State University land, he said.
He also said all decisions on state land were made by the regents at open meetings and not in secret
as the report implies. The lack of appraisals in some cases does not prove the university system did not
get fair value for the land it sold or traded away, Schramm added.

lins T41-CTimi (orna m m m oì ìiuì's m m m
By Krysti Harris
For the Alestle

Over the past year,
the St. Louis areq has
been flooded with
talk of expansions.
From the NFL Rams
expansion *
to
Lambert ; Airport's
battle over airport
expansion, it has
been a Hot topic.
Now SlUE's Greek
program is going
through
an
expansion of its own.
The
Collegiate
Pan-hellenic
Council has put together an
expansion committee consisting of
students and staff to look into the
expansion of another National Panhellenic Conference sorority to join
our Greek system.
\ 1
For those of you who are asking
yourselves, “ What is National Panhellenic Conference?
What is
Collegiate Pan-hellenic Council?
Why are the Greeks expanding?”
here's w hat I found out.
National Pan-hellenic Conference
(NPC) is an, international conference
body composed of 26 sororities. Its
purpose is to foster interfraternity
relationships, to assist collegiate
chapters of the NPC member groups
and to cooperate in maintaining the
highest
scholastic
and
social
standards.
Requirements for membership into
NPC are that a sorority must have
been established nationally a t least
thirteen years, all of Its collegiate
chapters must be established in
senior colleges and universities which
are authorized to confer bachelor
degrees, and it must have a minimum
o f' fourteen chapters and the
fourteenth chapter must be at least
two years old.
Collegiate Pan-hellenic Council is
just an extension of the NPC. At SIUE,
it is composed of delegates from
both the Alpha Sigma Tau and Alpha
Phi sororities and is organized to

afford cooperation between both
sororities. Members of the council are
selected by each sorority. Each
sorority selects tw o delegates to
represent it at NPC meetings. The
delegates cast the sorority vote,
serve on standing committees and
a c t as liaisons between their sorority
and the other NPC groups. There are
currently five members on the
Collegiate Pan-hellenic Committee.
Finally, why are the Greeks
expanding?
“A new sorority on campus could
add opportunities for more students
to get involved and provide more
exposure to the Greek system,”
Connan Campbell, coordinator of
Greek Life, said.
“ In choosing a new sorority for
expansion there are many questions
to consider. Is there g need? is there a
dem and? Can it survive? Can it
com pete with the sororities currently
here? And could it enhance the
quality of Greek experience?"
Campbell said, i feel that all these
questions could ;be answered with
the expansion.” ¡F Jennifer Cornelius, the vicepresident of Collegiate Pan-hellenic
Council, stated why she thinks
another sorority is needed.
“The addition of a third sorority will
help ease com petition between
Alpha Phi and Alpha Sigma Tau and
will help build a bigger and better
G'reek system,” Cornelius said.

Smiddy,
Chrissy
of
president
PanCollegiate
hellenic
Council,
agrees with Cornelius
but also feels::: the
expansion fo" a third
sorority on campus |/ill
further the growth of
the Greel^g system,
while helping out the
Daughters
of
the
Emerald.
“We are going to
prom ote the DOEs
with the hopes that
they g e t picked up by the new
chapter,” Smiddy said.
The Daughters of the Emerald was
formed on campus late last fall with
the help of the Sigma Pi fraternity. A
handful of Sigma Pi fraternities across
the country have helped create the
Daughters of the Emerald as a
daughter group to their fraternity. A
transfer student from Murray State
who was affiliated with the group
there helped the Sigma Pis get a
- group of giris together in the fall and
form a group here.
“ We were really excited about
getting started as a group on
campus, but we just kept running into
dead ends around every corner,”
said Jennifer Booth, a member of
DOE. “We couldn't form as a regular
group on campus because we were
to o much like a sorority and we
couldn't becom e a sorority because
we were not affiliated with a national
organization.”
Booth is looking forward to the
expansion.
“Wffh only having the two white
sororities, there isn't much of a variety
for incoming freshmen to choose
from. I think adding a third would be
beneficial for us, for the university and
for the Greek system as a whole,”
Booth said. “We will have the chance
to stay together as a group and the
expansion will help the university and
the Greek system increase retention.”

Gcaduaticn g if ts - the other stu ff yoa get a fte r yxrr diplara
Compiled by A lestle S ta ff
You’ve studied countless numbers of hours to remember the
difference between sine and cosine. You’ve written and re-written th a t
English paper only to realize th a t you don’t really know what an action
verb is. Night a fte r night, you’ve h it your head trying to memorize who
the twenty-third president of the United S ta tes was. And now, since you
somehow passed your courses, comes your big reward. Your graduation
gifts.
G ifts fo r graduation are often hard to find and difficult to choose. I
mean, really: what do you get th a t college student th a t has everything?
Wait, what college student has everything?
Well, we took to the campus and asked a few people what they
thought would be good graduation gifts and here’s what they said.
Of course, the m ost popular response was money. Who in their right
mind wouldn’t want money? Most of them agreed th a t they don’t ju s t
want the money to have it, but instead to use the money to help them
s ta r t out their life on their own.
A new car was also a popular response. The cars most students drive
around in are either on their last wheels, have been the family car and
given to the student ju s t for schooi, or something th a t they got ju s t to
get them around. The students, however, don’t ju s t want Mommy and
Daddy to pay fo r the car, although th a t wouldn’t be all th a t bad. They
would ju s t like to have their parents help them by either co-signing for
them or giving them a down payment.
Some students said they wouldn’t mind getting a vacation as a gift.
Other items, such as pen and pencil sets, were also mentioned by a
number of people. They figure th a t is the g ift th a t they will get from
relatives th a t they don’t see much. They also said th a t a briefcase or a
watch or some kind of jewelry would be nice.

One surprising g ift th a t some students said they wanted fo r their
graduation g ift was their firs t month of rent to be paid for. “ It would be
almost like getting cash,” they said, “but a t least this way you know
th a t the money isn’t going to waste.”
Whatever g ifts these students receive, nothing will match the one g ift
th a t most parents will give their child upon graduating— a hug.

Life after graduation
By Roy Gilmore
Editor in Chief
No more pulling “all*nighters,” trying to study fo r th a t ever-crucial
physics exam. And no more setting up th a t cheat sheet under your
sleeve to help “guide” you through th a t history exam.
Now you’re taking a much tougher exam— life.
“ it’s kind of scary,” Susan Worman said, “because you are in the
real world. Don’t get me wrong, I was relieved and happy to graduate,
but one bad thing is th a t I don’t have a job.”
The real world Worman is talking about is hard on some people and
kinder and gentler to others.
“ ! was a little bit scared a t firs t,” Heather Clausen, a special
education teacher a t the Madison County Detention Home, said.
“ (3ut it’s a little more casual and laid back (in the real world— more
than I expected), but th a t makes i t more exciting and enjoyable.”
Although some people have an easier time adjusting, others seem
to have trouble finding ways to keep them going.

Graduating leaves some questions unanswered
E5y Roy Gilmore
Editor in Chief
“So when are you graduating?”
“So what are going to do a fte r you graduate?”
“ Do you have any jobs lined up yet?”
These are all questions th a t a lot graduates have heard
over the past year from their friends and their parents. Most
of the graduates-to-be don’t have answers to two of the three
questions, yet they are determined not to let th a t get them
down.
John Hyde, a physical education major, describes his
graduation day as “finally.”
“ I took a long route to get to my graduation day and a t
times it’s been hard, but for the m ost part, I’m glad it ’s over."
Hyde’s view of graduation is similar to others who are
graduating or who have graduated.
“ I was relieved and happy,” said Susan Worman, who
graduated in December with a degree in physical education. “ I
was happy because there was no more studying.”
Jennifer Floyd, a mass communications major, doesn’t quite
look a t it like Hyde and Worman.
“ I can’t believe it ’s finally here,” she said. “ I’ve been in school
for 1S> consecutive years and now it’s like I’m not going to be in
» *
school anymore.”
“ I don’t look a t graduation as the end,” Leslie Hunche, a
graphics design major explained. “ I think of it more or less like
the beginning of a lot more hard work ahead.”
Aside from ju s t graduating, most graduates are polishing up on their interviewing skills. Hunche has had five interviews and each one, she says,
is different than the last.
“Some of the interviews last an hour and a half and some last ten minutes,” she said. “A fte r some of the interviews, you feel like ‘God, when are
they going to call back?* or ‘Call back soon’ and others, as soon as you walk out the door, you realize th a t you are not the right person fo r the
position.”
But to most graduates, the one thing th a t has them a little s cared is getting a job.
“ I’m disappointed th a t I don’t have a job waiting for me,’"
Floyd said. “ I’m disappointed in myself for not putting
enough time in looking fo r a job. I do, however, have a parttime job in my field now, so I’m not going to starve or
anything.”
Hyde, who is constantly sending o ff resumes to high
schools aero ss Illinois, says this is the most hectic time for
him.
“You hear about a job opening in an area th a t you like and
you s ta r t to get excited. Then, as you s it down to write the
cover letter, you s ta r t thinking, ‘I don’t have a prayer a t
getting this job.’ But you still send off the resume hoping
you get the job,” he said.
All in all, these graduates are happy about one thing—

Disney’s New Film: A peach or the pits?
By Melanie Adams

Assistant News Editor
stars out o f four
For those who love anim ated films, “James and the G iant Peach” is the
flick for you. This Disney classic is based on the best-selling book, James and
the Giant Peach, written by R oald D ahl in 1961.
The movie follows the exciting journey of a lonely boy nam ed James who
is sent to live with his evil aunts, Sponge and Spiker, after the death of his
parents. U nw anted and m istreated, Jam es longs for the chance to go to New
York City, a place his father told him that dream s come true.
A s the story progresses, Jam es m eets a m ysterious old m an who gives him
a bag of magical green things and tells him that w ondrous things will happen.
Pressed for time to explain how the magic works, the man tells him that the
answers will be found within his own heart. Filled with hope, James races
home, unfortunately spilling the m arvelous magical green things at the base
of an old peach tree.
Filled with despair, James frantically tries to catch them before they slip
into the ground but to no avail, and his green things are lost forever. But
som ething magical happens, a peach appears on the tree and soon grows to
an enorm ous size.
Sponge and Spiker, wanting to take advantage of their crop, forbid James
to even touch the peach. In an act of starvation, Jam es sneaks out that
evening and rem oves a large section to eat. Just as he is ready to put the tasty
m orsel to his lips, the very last green thing wriggles into the bite, turning him

I rem em ber the most.
Have you ever practiced for som ething so
hard that all you could do is sleep, eat and
drink it? Well, that was the case with preparing for the step show. W hen I was
at home, I stepped. While I was in class (and the professors w eren’t looking), I
stepped. While in the A lestle office, driving all of my co-workers crazy, I
stepped. Even while 1 was in church— I asked G od for forgiveness first—I
stepped.
1 was stepping so much that my friends who have no rhythm , no sense of
what being on beat is, were trying to step. That am used me much. I have

A n assortm ent of thoughts came to my mind when I first hit the stage: Is
my zipper up? W ho’s calling my nam e? D o I look okay? W ho left the dam n
faucet on? 1 want my mommy! Anyway, I went out there and as James Brown

Even though my fraternity did not win, I had fun. But beware: you never

“G odfather of SIU E soul.”

□□□□□□
D o n 't you just hate it when Springiest comes around? I m ean, who came
up with the idea of having this wonderful event while classes are still being
held? It’s like Jesus being tem pted by the devil himself. You begin to debate
to yourself w hether or not you should go to class, to go to that cold or hot
classroom (depending on which building your class is being held in on
campus). You ask yourself questions like “Now, my class is not REALLY that
im portant today, is it?” Then you end up missing not only W ednesday’s
classes, but Thursday’s and Friday’s also. A nd then there is the reply you
receive from your professor upon your return M onday morning: “So, Indiana
Jones, what countries did you travel to this tim e?”
Springiest comes at a time when finals are within two weeks. I would like
to see it on a w eekend for just one year to see how many teachers would get a
chance to enjoy it, instead of professors contem plating in their empty
classrooms asking,“Now, I w onder where all my studious students are?”
A nother thing about Springfest is th at it always com es around during the
time that 1 want to start eating healthier or go on a diet. Once I see items
such as cotton candy, grilled hot dogs, polish sausages and snowcones,
however, I say to hell with the diet, long live King G lutton! So for all of those
individuals who are stressed out, take time out today and tom orrow and enjoy
yourself. Beware: final exams are lurking, just like Jaws, and you know that
Jaws has a BIG BITE!

Oh, by the way, m ake sure you read my last column of the sem ester in next

The Suede Chain to perform St. Louis Dancers to perform
today at Springfest
"Dance Detour7 May 3 and 4
Compiled from entertainment reports

(Press Release)

The Cham paign, Ill.-based band The Suede Chain will be perform ing
in the Q uad today as part of Springfest activities. The time slot will be
from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
The band includes m em bers M att (lead vocals, guitars) and Jason
D octor (drums), who are twins, Brian Krum m (lead guitar), Brian H unt
(bass), Mary W eingartner (violin) and Jake Brookm an (cello). The
D octor twins, Krumm and H unt are all originally from Collinsville, 111.
The band’s sound has developed from the alternative rock band they
were 10 years ago to one of “perform ance-y rock.”
The band has received various praises from publications such as The
Daily Illini, which gave the band’s second CD Piloted by Ghost off of the
Mud Records label an impressive four stars. O ther noted publications
that have jum ped on The Suede C hain’s sound include Billboard,
St.Louis Post-Dispatch and the Riverfront Times. In fact, in 1994, Steve
Pick, of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, m entioned The Suede Chain as one
of the top concert acts of that year.

W hat do a Ph.D. candidate, m arketing professional, chiropractic student, yoga
teacher, arborist, credit union trainer and biology professor have in com m on? They
are all dancing in “Dance D etour.”
Ten independent artists put their elbow grease together to build this exciting,
collaborative concert. The group got in-gear last fall, accelerated by a desire to
perform and present choreography in St. Louis.
Eight of the pieces in the program are prem ieres and two are being shown for the
first time in St. Louis. With six choreographers, “D ance D e to u r” delivers a wide variety
of m ovem ent, them es and styles. D ance ranges from the group piece “Inkblots and
Passages” by Lori Roof-Racine, an exploration of the consequences of lives’ paths
crossing, to the quartet “W omen With Balls” by Sandy Pylipow, a playful study of
m ovem ent with props, to the satirical duet “Spilled” by M ary Ann Rund.
The artists driving “D ance D e to u r” bring extensive and eclectic experience to the
concert. Most of the dancers have perform ed with regional m odern dance companies,
including Burning Feet C ontem porary D ance Company, and have shown their work
in concerts throughout the country.
“D ance D e to u r” is veering your way on Friday, May 3 and Saturday, May 4 at 8 p.m.
in Olin Studio I in the W om en’s Building at W ashington University. Tickets are
available at the door for $5.00.

If you think you're
having a heart attack,
think out loud.
Chest discomfort that
lasts longer than

to fool around with.
Play it safe and ask someone

gency room— immediately.

Tennis loses to Bellarmine; rolls over Lewis
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter
With a trip to Romeoville, 111., last
weekend the SIU E m en’s tennis team
saw themselves split their two matches.
The C ougars lost a nail b itte r to
Bellarmine, the num ber one team in the
G reat Lakes Valley Conference, 4 points
to 3 in the first contest on Saturday.
Junior Jason G em inn won at first
singles 6-2,6-0 to keep him undefeated in
GLVC play.
C hatham ’s E than Hallberg pulled out
a three set victory, 6-1,4-6,6-1, at num ber
two singles.
A berdeen, South D akota native, Nate
R eede, won in straight sets over
B ellarm ine’s Brad Bowman 7-5,6-3.
Gem inn and H allberg also team ed up
to win their doubles match 8-6 in the first
doubles position.
“We played Bellarm ine really close,”
head coach Bill Logan said on
W ednesday afternoon.
In the second match of the day, SIUE
had no problem with Lewis College
beating them 6-1.
G em inn won his match in easy fashion
6-2,6-0. H allberg won 6-2,6-1. R eede won
his match at three singles 6-0, 6-2. Senior

On the doubles side, Logan made a
change in the doubles team s that saw
Reede and G em inn win 8-3.
“In many of our m atches we have been
losing the doubles point,” Logan said. “I

that work for us so that we can win the
(doubles) point and have a better chance
at winning the m atch.”
The women closed out their season
with a victory against SWB 6-1.

Softball can’t find their offensive drive
Cougars offense has been blanked in two of their last three games
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor

-

Offense has not been a strong suit for the SIUE softball team in the past
three games as they have been shutout in two of those three match-ups.
Tuesday night the Cougars split a pair with IUPU-Indianapolis and then lost
the front end of a doubleheader with Quincy University to drop their overall

In the second game, the Cougars
looked a little better offensively
outscoring their opposition 5 to 4.
The Cougars received a good
game by Deanna Smith who hit a
triple, single and was the winning
pitcher.
“Deana Smith did a good job,”
Montgomery said. “We scored four
points early and then didn’t score
until the seventh.”

Wednesday night as the Cougars fell 3-0 to Quincy.
With the wind blowing directly out of the stadium, with some strong gusts,
one might think this could be a high scoring game.
But the players have to hit the ball with some authority first. The Quincy
pitcher struck out the first three Cougars up to bat on hard high fastballs.
Quincy then capitalized on an error by the Cougars to go up 1-0 in the
second inning.
