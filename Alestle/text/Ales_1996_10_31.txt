Voter apathy has been a
recurring them e in the past
several elections. B ut if
figures from the M adison

indication, the popular student
phrase “Apathy Sucks" won't be
evident at SIUE.
L ast m onth, with the

organizations, 431 people
registered to vote — about

1992’s figure.
T he q u estion now is —

how many of those registered
voters will actually punch the
ballot next Tuesday?
If the trend continues from
the last presidential election,
quite a few will.
Figures from the Madison

Clinton insulters cleared of charges

A P — Right-wing survivalist
James G. “B o” G ritz pleaded
innocent in Enfield, Conn., Tuesday to attem pted kidnapping charges
stemming from his efforts to help a woman involved in a child
custody battle. G ritz and his son, James R. Gritz, who also pleaded
innocent, were arrested Sept. 30 outside a school attended by one of
Linda W iegand’s children. H er husband has custody of their two

International

CH IC A G O — A couple arrested at the Taste of Chicago
food fair following a rude rem ark to President Clinton were
freed of disorderly conduct charges Tuesday when
prosecutors said there was not enough evidence. Glenn and
Patricia M endoza, both 32, of suburban W estchester had
been arrested July 2 after the president approached them
and Patricia M endoza responded with a rude rem ark. She
said the rem ark was: “You suck and those boys died,”
referring to the June 25 attack at a U.S. installation in Saudi
A rabia that killed 19 Am erican airmen. Secret Service
agents said they heard somthing else that could have been
taken as a threat against the president.

A P — Wang D an, one of C hina’s most prom inent dissidents and a
leader of the Tiananm en Square pro-dem ocracy protests, went on
trial today on charges of trying to overthrow the government. The

refused to let international observers attend. A court official would
only say that the trial had begun. Wang, 27, was a leader of the anti­
governm ent protests in 1989, which ended in a bloody military
crackdown. A fter three and a half years in prison, he resum ed his
call for political change and tolerance.

ethics, tl|e time is now at hand
for Americans to m ak e a
choice.
On T u ^ f f
1996 at 7:30 a:m. at a poll
booth in East St.S&flais^.this
reporter will cast his
President W illiam Jefferson'4
C linton.
D espite
the
allegations about his ethics
and character, Clinton is the

Darryl Howlett
best person to lead this
country into the 21st Century.
From the tim e President
Clinton took office, attacks on
his
ethics
and
policies
hindered his first year and
a half.
Many people felt he was
indecisive in the way he
handled the issue of allowing
gays and lesbians into the
m ilitary, the budget and
universal health care for
everyone. First and foremost,
Clinton has proven to be a
great compromiser. In order
not to lose policies completely,
he sacrificed some issues. Yes,
some of these were promises in
his cam paign in 1992. But
given
the
R epublican's
extreme vision for America,
sacrifice was good. C linton
may have lost some battles,
however, he won his war.
The
questioning
of
Clinton’s ethics by presidential
candidate
Bob
Dole
is
puzzling.
People
m ust
remember that we’re in an age
of mass media and constant
scrutiny. C linton has done
things that he probably now
regrets. There are some things
that Clinton has done th at are
perhaps unethical. Surely the

interests. And let
how President, th S P fV ic
President,
Bush
dodged
questions in 1987 and 1988
about his involvement in the
Iran-C ontra Affair. Americans
still elected Bush as president
in 1988, because they thought
he would be the best person to
lead the nation— sam e as
President Clinton.
Clinton has proven in his
four
years
to
be
a
com passionate,
intelligent
forceful president. W hen the
R epublicans
won
both
Congressional houses in 1994,
he didn’t wither. He heard the
Am erican people and then
proceeded to beat the Republicans
at their own game.
C linton
has
endured
countless attacks about W hite
W ater, the Paula Jones case,
and the infamous FBI files.
And
every
time,
“The
Comeback Kid” has taken the
heat and remained on top.
W ith Clinton ahead in the
polls, m any Am ericans are
questioning the ethics of
America itself. And some have
a valid point, but did anyone
question
the
ethics
of
Kennedy? No, and he was a
great president. But if ethics
m ust rem ain essential in
electing a president, then let
the people decide.
The country is in good
condition financially, and
improving socially.
And on November 5, 1996
this
23-year-old
African
American SIUE student out of
East St. Louis, 111. will cast his
vote for the best possible
future of America. His name
is Bill Clinton

Unlike my colleague, when
I cast my vote Nov. 5 the man
I will choose to be this nation's
next president will be Robert
Joseph Dole.
W hile there are a few
similarities between the two
candidates, such as strong
political women behind them,
and a shared view on foreign
policy, the man best suited for
leading us into the 21st
Century is Bob Dole.
Not only is Bob Dole strong
in character and strong in
morals, but he also promises a
15 percent tax cut if elected.
For those of us who are
tired of paying outrageous
taxes, his 15 percent tax cut does
sound promising.
Bob Dole is also an
advocate of drug reduction in
our schools and nation which
is very encouraging. If elected,
he plans to get tough on drugs
and plans to reduce trade,
m ilitary
assistance
and
interaction with any country
who continues to sell drugs to
the American people.
He also intends to form a $6
billion Opportunity Scholarship
th a t will allow parents to
choose the schools that their
children will attend.

A person's ch aracter is*

decisions a president makes
effect him /her but his/her
decisions will also affect the
rest of the nation.
A president is more than
ju st a decision m aker, a
president is also a role model.
The President of the United
States is a respectable title, one
that can't be taken too lightly.
And w hether or not the
president wants to accept the
title of role model, to all of the

know m ore ab o u t an organization as
significant as the Panthers and why it has
been devalued,” Jones said.
Jones also said that the organization was
not fully appreciated by both activists and
scholars.
Jones then gave his background on his
fascination with the Black Panther Party
which stem m ed from growing up during the
period.
“ Back th en , my g en eratio n typically
overly-rom anticized the P anther party, but as
I got older I did m ore in-depth research
about both the positive and negative aspects
of the Panthers,” Jones said.
Jones said in doing extensive research on
the Panthers, he has interview ed 30 to 40
form er m embers.
Jo nes co n trib u ted the em ergence of
popular interest in the Black P anther Party
to rap culture, the movie about them , popular
m agazines and the explosion o f books
w ritten on the Black Panthers.
Som e of the new groups fashioning
them selves like the Black Panthers include
Black P anther Party out of M ilwaukee, Wise.,
New Black P anther Party out of Dallas, Tx.
and
th e A frican-A m erican V anguard
M ovem ent out of Los Angeles. Jones said
none of the movements have Panther affiliations.
Jones also gave the audience a com plete
b reak d o w n of the history of the Black
P an th er Party from its early beginnings in
O akland, C alifornia with H uey P. N ewton in
the late 1960s to the disbandm ent in 1982.
Jones also com m ented on the changes
w hich H u ey N ew ton w ent through in
form ing the Black Panthers.
Jones then answ ered his own question
about the legacy of the Black Panthers.
“The Panthers produced a rich and m ulti­
cultural legacy. A legacy of the im portance of
arm ed-resistance, tradition of com m unity
service, a com m itm ent to equality of people
and offered a model for all people,” Jones said.
Jo nes said th at m any people only
rem em ber the Black Panthers as carrying
guns and running into problem s with law
officials and the federal governm ent.
“ P eople do not realize that in its
beginnings th e P an th ers provided free

breakfast program s, a weekly new spaper,
free health clinics, free am bulance services
and free transportation to prisons,” Jones said.
Jones also told the audience that the
Panther m ovem ent spread to other races and
n ationalities— A ustralia, Israel, B erm uda
and India.
Jones said that many people believed that
the Panthers were anti-white, ultra-leftist,
lum pen-proletarian (low-class) and a mediacreated image.
“The P anthers w ere a far m ore
h eterogenous diverse group. They w ere
college students, working class, some were
principals,” Jones said.
Jones ended his forum with em phasizing
that many of the m em bers of the Black
Panthers — and also o ther civil rights and
social groups — w ere the sam e age as
students in the audience.
“The average age of these people making
changes was betw een 19 and 21. I would
encourage any student to becom e m ore
involved in the political process in order to
change many things that affect our society,”
Jones said.
Two m em bers of the Black S tudent
A ssociation were pleased with the message
from Jones.
“ I thought it was very interesting. I
learned a lot. Dr. Jones broke down the
P an th ers’ history year by year,” Latisha
R obinson, vice-president o f the Black
Student O rganization, said.
P resident Terrance G addy also found
positive aspects in the forum.
“For the overall program , it was good to
see so many students involved to hear the
forum ,” G addy said. “I think Dr. Jones gave
some insight on how students can change
things in the political process.”
Jones received a bachelor's degree in
political science from Fayetteville State
University in Fayetteville, N orth Carolina.
H e then went on to receive his m aster and
doctorate degree's from W ashington State
University in 1985.
His extensive work on the Black Panthers
has appeared in num erous scholarly journals
and magazines throughout the country.

I'm going to die if I do n ’t
vote,” Stedm an said.
If she had registered, Stedm an
would have voted for Clinton.
“I
think
D ole
has
problem s. H e is m entally
handicapped
or
crazy,”
Stedm an said.
O th e r reasons for not
voting included: “ I’ve never
done it before and do n ’t think
I care to start,” “I didn’t get an
ab sentee b allo t,” “ I d o n ’t
know who to vote for,” “I don’t
have time” and “None of the
candidates deserve my vote”.
The stu d en ts refused to
com m ent any fu rth e r and
m ade th eir com m ents in
passing. All said they didn’t
have five m inutes to discuss
issues that could be critical in
their futures.
But not all of the students
in the Residence Hall were
apathetic about voting. A few
students w ere even excited
ab o u t the chance to voice
their opinions. A fter all, this is
the first opportunity for some
o f them to vote in a
presidential election.
M att E rvin, a freshm an
from Blue M ound, 111., said he
didn’t know who he would be
voting for next week.
“I like the guy with the big
ears the best. But 1 think I
need an absentee ballot to
vote. I hope 1 can still get
one,” Ervin said.
H e thinks MTV has done a
good jo b of presenting
political inform ation in an
educational, yet entertaining,
form at on “Rock the Vote”.
Ervin says most students
find politics boring. H e thinks
candidates need to be m ore
en tertain in g in addition to
using m ore advertising to
reach college students.

Jason Lohm a ■. a freshman
from Aviston, I I , says he is
“pretty much a Republican”.
So he will be v< ling for Dole
next week.
“ I do n ’t feel Clinton is a
decent person a all,” Lohm an
said.
L ohm an d o e sn ’t think
much can be dor e to motivate
college students lo vote.
“ By this a g ;, you have
pretty much decided what you
find im portant,’
Lohm an
said.
A ngie A11e*\ a freshm an
from Assum p n, 111., hasn’t
decided on a
'idate yet.
But she thinks she may vote
for Clinton.
“I like his policies on
education and student loans
because that affects me," she said.
A llen
said
candidates
should focus m ore on issues
for young people in order to
get students’ attention and votes.
Jason H u lb ert, a ju nior
from Mt. Vernon, 111., said he
w ould be voting straight
D em ocrat in this election. He
thinks students should take
part in the election.
“Students d o n ’t have the
right to com plain unless they
practice the right to vote,”
H ulbert said.
H u lb ert
also
said
candidates should focus more
on issues and visit as many
college campuses as possible.
Barry Delassus, a freshman
from B righton, 111., will be
voting straight Republican.
“I like D o le’s opinions. He
is a b e tte r person than
Clinton,” Delassus said.
A lthough the students
disagreed about for whom to
vote, they did agree that Perot
should have been included in
the debates.

Electoral college: dinosaur
in a m o d e rn a g e ?
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
With every presidential election comes the debate over
w hether the E lectoral College has run its course.
The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, who after
each presidential election cast their votes for president and
vice-president on behalf of their particular state.
Each state has as m any electoral votes as the m em bers of
U.S. R epresentatives and Senators combined. However,
M aine and N ebraska divide their Electoral College votes
according to who wins in each congressional district.
Lynn M aurer, assistant political science professor, sees
both positive and negative aspects of the Electoral College.
“The fram ers (founders) of the C onstitution thought the
electors would be people m aking decisions on who would
be president, using their own judgm ent,” M aurer said.
“However, th a t’s not very dem ocratic.”
The Electoral College did change its policy to vote with
the popular vote of the people.
The question rem ains w hether the Electoral College is
needed when past presidents have been elected w ithout a
m ajority of the popular vote.
“M ost presidents d o n ’t have the support of the people
but then m ost people do not vote on election day,” M aurer
said.
“The im portant thing is that the E lectoral College is the
way the people vote. If electors ever vote contrary to the
popular vote o f each state, I would have a problem with
that,” M aurer said.
M aurer also believes that Clinton will win next w eek’s
election, agreeing with what the polls are indicating.
“I think Clinton will do really well. A ccurate with what
the polls are suggesting. The only problem Clinton would
have is if his supporters look at the polls and decide not to
show up,” M aurer said.

T h e ^ fo v ie
By Corey Stulce
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
T h e re is a story that usually gets m en­
tioned around H allow een in St. Louis. Like
many tales, it is blown up and out of pro­
portion, and the details are shaky at best.
T h e only true rum or usually heard is that
it was a boy who was possessed. This is the
true story of the exorcism that took place,
partly in St. Louis.
T h e novel and film “The Exorcist” were
both very popular years ago, and they were
partly based on the events which took place
nearly fifty years ago. M any of the details
were “Hollywood-ized,” so in 1993, author
Thomas B. A llen released a book called
“Possessed”. In it he w rote in great detail
about the exorcism which took place in 1949.
T h e story begins with the boy and his
family living in Mt. R ainier, M aryland.
According to Allen, the boy’s aunt had
started to teach him how to use a Ouija
board.
Soon after, she died. A few nights after
her death, the family started to notice
strange sounds, first a dripping, and then a
scratching sound under the floorboards.
T h e family was convinced that it was the
dead aunt attem pting to contact them .
They spoke to her, and asked for a sign. A
wave of pressure was sent into the m embers
of the family and then into the floor.
S oon after this night, stranger things
began to happen. Item s would move around
the room. The m attress the boy was on
would shake slowly at first, and then vio­
lently. His desk would fall over at school.
A t first, every o n e thought these w ere

pranks, but they started to become con­
vinced otherwise after the events continued
for some time.
T h e family called in Reverend Luther
Schultze, a Lutheran minister, because they
now believed there was a poltergeist tor­
m enting their son.
T h e boy was now having awful night­
mares where he would tear at the sheets
and thrash in agony all night. Scratches
started to appear on the boy’s body, and
that is when Schultze decided it was more
of a job for the Catholics.
F ath er A lbert Hughes attem pted to take
on the exorcism. O ne night, after he was
tied down, the boy was able to free one of
his arms from restraint. H e somehow got a
bedspring loose, and cut a huge gash into
H ughes’ arm. Hughes left the exorcism and
soon after had a breakdown.
T h e family decided that they needed to
get away from home, and maybe a trip to
stay with family in St. Louis would help the
boy’s condition. Strange events continued
to take place in St. Louis, however, and the
family derided tlie boy needed more religious help.
F ath er Raym ond Bishop was called in to
help. H e contacted a close friend, Father
William Bowdern, to assist him. N either
man was very familiar with the act of exor­
cism, so they began studying.
M eanwhile, the boy was fine during the
day, but at night was still having terrors. He
was falling deeper into possession.
B ow dern was told by the Archbishop not
to discuss the case with anyone. He asked
W alter H alloran, an academic at St. Louis
University, to drive him to the house where
the boy was staying.
Bishop kept a diary of the events, in
order to help in future exorcisms. Bowdern
started the exorcism by reciting prayers from
“The Roman Ritual”.
O nce he began, the boy needed to be
held down much of the time. The boy would

scream out in pain at the prayers. Each
tim e the nam e of G od was mentioned, in
any form, deep scratches or welts would
appear on the boy’s chest and stomach.
A t one point, the word H E L L was
scratched onto the boy’s chest, but upside
down so when the boy looked down he
could read it. The boy would spit at the
people in the room.
“H e was an utter m arksm an at a distance
of four or five feet,” said Halloran. “His
eyes were closed, and h e’d spit right in your
face.”
T h e prayers would continue until dawn
for many nights, and then the boy would
fall into a natural sleep. The boy was get­
ting worse.
T h e dem on inside him was now singing
and yelling at the priests in the room. He
would curse and make sexual references
about the men in the room.
T h ere were also a couple of incidents in
the daytime when the possession showed
itself. H alloran took the boy one afternoon
to get some fresh air. H e took him to an
area to see the stations of the cross.
“Because of the state of possession, he
took off running,” said Halloran. “H e ran
to the bluffs, towards the edge, where there
was a big drop below. I finally caught him.
I have no idea if he would’ve awakened
before he got to the edge or not.”
T o give the family some rest, Bowdern
took the boy to Alexian Brothers Hospital
for a night. That night, the boy was tied to
the bed, and the exorcism continued with­
out any outbursts from the boy.
Soon after, the possession went back to its pre­
vious state.. One night,the boy broke HaOoran’s nose.
In Bishop’s diary he was also recorded as say­
ing to Bowdern, “I’m in hell. I see you. You’re in
hell. It’s 1957.” T h e rem ark seemed to have
some effect on Bowdern. •
T h e priests m oved the boy back to
Alexian Brothers Hospital. H e started to

By Peggy A. Moeller
For The Alestle
Allen and Audrey Murphy, infant children of Mr. and Mrs.
A ndrew M urphy of Red Bud, Illinois miraculously escaped death
while asleep in their beds during the wee hours of the morning. A
truck, owned by Pam ela M acintosh of Red Bud, charged down a
hill coming to rest only inches away from the children’s room. Had
the M acintosh truck not struck a vehicle owned by George Karsch
before crossing the street, this incident could have resulted in the
death of two small children.
“They could have been killed,” said Murphy.
“There was an eerie presence when the truck
came to rest. This wasn’t the first time this has
happened to us,” the M urphy’s added. The
M acintosh vehicle has just missed crashing
into our home three times this year alone.!
“Something strange is going on over here, I
tell you,” said Murphy. “Something strange!”
When M acintosh was questioned about the
bizarre happening, she stated, “I believe our vehi­
cle is possessed.”
“This incident has happened several times since I have
moved into this house on the hill, which happens to be located next
to the cemetery,” M urphy said.
“We’ve tried everything,” lamented Murphy. “We park near the back
alley, and even parked it (the car) against our patio so it couldn’t roll. It still
keeps rolling downhill. Ironically, it only happens on the sixth of the month,”
Murphy added.
Through the help of the local police departm ent, Mrs. M acintosh

e x o r c is â t

and her husband, Edw in, decided to get in touch with
Father Branegan.
Branegan is an expert in psychic phenom ena. Upon request,
Father Branegan agreed to come and perform an exorcism on the
M acintosh vehicle.
It was decided that the exorcism would be on the sixth of the month, the
same day as the prior occurrences. The events that followed were shocking
and clearly unexplained.
Father Branegan, along with the M acintosh’s, met outside their
home on the sixth of the following month. For nearly two hours
nothing happened. G etting impatient, Mrs. M acintosh was ready to
call it quits. All of a sudden the lights on the truck started
blinking on and off. While this phenom enon start­
ed the horn started blasting, and suddenly the
truck reared up like a horse and started mov­
ing down the hill at an excessive speed. As
before the truck came to rest only inches
away from the children’s room.
Cautiously, Father Branegan and the
M acintosh's crossed over to the truck. The
priest stated that there were definite indications
of unusual supernatural activity. He decided that
additional research would be required before the exorcism
could be perform ed.
He spent the next several months studying and doing research on
the neighborhood and nearby cemetery. His research revealed to
him some of the most astounding and unbelievable facts. He decid­
ed that he would keep his discoveries until the scheduled exorcism
the following month.
E d ito r’s note: The events in the story were based on a true event.

T hursday, O c to b e r 31, 1996

for every Halloween
By Greg Lcvrault
For T he A le s tle
You’re an adult now (at least in court); no m ore
free candy on Halloween..
From now on, Hallow een is another m arketing
opportunity. The stores push, and givethe opportuni­
ty for several dozen scream ing children to knock on
your door and get free stuff — and you gotta give it
to them! You can’t get out of handing out candy.
Deal with it; it’s part of Halloween, they did it for
you and now the plastic bowl has been passed on to
you.
Think you can get out of it? C onsider your
options:
You can leave. Sure, th ere’s no reason to think
anything’s going to happen tonight, just because
you’re so stingy you d o n ’t w ant those pesky little
beggars on your doorstep. So leave... keep the lights
off... pretend H allow een isn’t happening...
A nd what do you think you’re going to find when
you get hom e?
You can leave, but have a bowl waiting. You real­
ly can’t stay hom e tonight, but you don’t want the
kids to leave em pty-handed. So th e re ’s a bowl of
candy waiting on the step, and a nice sign over it, say­
ing “Please take one” .
The honor system will hold for m aybe twenty
m inutes before some greedy fifth-grade, school-bus
bully takes it, bowl and all. Believe me, the only way
the bowl is still going to be there is if you fill it with
candy com and nothing else.
You can turn off all the lights and pretend you’re
not home. T h at’s worse than leaving. Sure, you can
scare off any would-be vandalizers if they get too
close. This is the first step on a long road. A t the road,
you’re that grouchy old goat in the neighborhood

parents threaten to leave their kids with when
they’re bad.
You can set up a motion-sensitive “scarecrow”
that plays selections from 1001 Hollywood Screams
whenever anyone gets within ten feet of your house.
Expensive...but that could work. M ake sure you
rem em ber in case you have to go out for the night.
D o n ’t go hom e and surprise yourself to death.
A dd up the facts, and it’s cheaper, easier and more
fun to simply give the kids what they want: free
candy. They gave the candy to you Holly Hobby's,
Monchichis, and little Freddie Kruegers, now you get
to give it to Power Rangers and Batm en. It can be
fun, too, if you do it right.
Have plenty of candy handy. Think of it this way;
get enough that th ere’ll be som ething left for you.
You never know how many kids will or w on’t stop
by, and th ere’s some perverse thrill in digging into a
hoard of Halloween candy well into the holidays.
You can dress up, but don’t be too scary. D o n ’t
dress like Bob Dole.
Seriously, even Mickey Mouse is scary if h e ’s tall
enough. Dressing up gets you in the spirit, though,
and everybody digs that. A nd for goodness sake,
don’t scream at the kids!
If possible, have a candy buddy. It’s hard to call
just when the kids stop by, and how long you’ll be sit­
ting by yourself wondering w hat’s so bad about your
house. Som eone else helps the time pass, and helps
m ake the night fun.
Mood music is fine, but be sure you can hear the kids.
D on’t throw candy overhand. Let the kids come
up to the door, and give candy to the kids that say
“Trick or Treat” first (can you imagine? Some kids
these days don’t even bother. Sigh...)
Put a small fistful in the bag. D on’t be skimpy, and
don’t go overboard. A bout three to five of small

chocolate bars, one bag of that candy that they only
sell on H alloween, or one big candy bar, if you’re
that generous.
Com plem ent on costumes, if w orth com plem ent­
ing. Keep com plem ents short.
D on't serve beer.
Thank the kids for stopping by.
Candy is the standard; chocolate is preferred, fol­
lowed by chewy fruit things and sweet tarts. For
some reason, Halloween beads and candy corn litter
the landscape; find a kid that takes these in trade,
and you find the kid that eats alone at lunch in
school.
If som ething in you feels guilty about contributing
to tarta r buildup and hyperactivity, there are plenty
of affordable alternatives:
- crappy carnival toys and rings (available at party
wholesalers)
- Your worthless baseball cards
- M exican currency
- business cards with the sign language alphabet
on them.
- floss
- issues of “The Kingdom ”
- pencils/ pens
- the rem nants from those free survival packets
you got at the beginning of the semester.
Otherwise, go to Sam s’ warehouse, and buy a
gross of something.
You may not be able to trick or treat anymore, but
d o n ’t be bitter. You now play an im portant role in
the tradition of H alloween, and in the happiness of
the children th at live around you. If you get those
kids that seem a little too big for trick or treating,
you can drop the hint subtly. Give them the candy
corn.

Halloween m m can sttll be fun
By Marlin Thomas
For The A lestle
O kay, H allow een sucks after you’re 14. B ut just
because you’re giving the candy instead of getting
it d oesn’t m ean that the H allow een fun has ended
for you. H allow een is that chance to explore the
m ysteries in life, to see w hat’s under the shadows.
It’s also a great excuse to w ear goofy noses and
makeup.
I f you want to get beyond the candy part, here
are som e suggestions, with some pros and cons,
and how much it’ll probably set you back:
G o to the H aunted H ouses in the area. Leave
the neighborhood behind, and let yourself get
scared by minimum-wage ghosts and spaghetti
brains. R em em ber, you have to pay for quality
j,
this case, and you usually get what you pay foV.
Look and listen for coupon specials for whichev­
er house you want to haunt.
Pro: W hat’s m ore halloweeny than going to a
haunted house? Plus, scantily clad vampiresses...
Con: W hat’s m ore halloweeny than going to a
haunted house like every body else? Plus, you usu­
ally^ can’t go in costum e in these places. Price
R ange (for two adults): $8 (local jaycees/ youth
center) — $30+ (Six Flags, Lem p Shocktoberfest)
P lay a prank or two. Sure, it’s Halloween, right?
Why not do a couple o f classics? T P some trees, soap
a few windows, dispatch the flaming bag o f dog...
anyway, Hallow een would seem to be carte blanche
for m ischief making, but th ere’s a lot to consider
before doing so. The right prank is harmless, has tim ­

happened to you? A nd where are you going to
get that
m uch cheese whiz?
Price Range: 25 cents (glue a q u arter to the side­
walk) to 3 to 5 years
G o to the clubs/bars. Many of these places
are having costum e nights, so it’s a good excuse
to throw on the cape and stick those neckbolts
on.
W h e th e r it’s a concert, like Gravity Kills or
Michelle Shocked, or just disco, Halloween is a
night to howl, and your local dive is a perfect
place to howl it up with 20 to 100 of your newest
friends. Rem em ber, drink responsibly, especially
since you’re in costume.
Pro: You get to hang with all the o th er partyers tonight; plus, you may not
get
free
candy, but you can have beer now.
Con: Same problem with clubs every night,
but everybody’s a little
weirder.
Price Range: Free to $??? (how drunk do you

ing and creativity, and is not illegal, threatening, or
extrem ely disturbing. T here’s no need to be digging
up your neighbor’s pet. Rem em ber, even if you do n ’t
act like an adult, you can be tried as one.
Pro: W hat could be m ore H allow eeny than
putting the ‘trick’ in ‘trick o ’ treating’?
Con: Is it a good trick? Will you be doing time for
it? Would you think
it was funny if it

Thinner. It’s an old Stephen King story that looks
just positively eerie.
Pro: You get to see a new horror flick on

Con: You get to have nightm ares of the new hor­

Gemini (May 21- June 20): I know all about your
razors in the caramel apples bit. Give it up, the
authorities are on their way buddy!

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Turn over a
new leaf. Stop using the pick up line, “Hey
baby, I ’m the real Great Pumpkin.” They’re
not buying what you’re selling, bucko.

Cancer (June 21-July 22): That evil
Halloween music is playing in your head and
your head alone. Go ahead, be famous. SIUE
needs some slasher alumni to keep this school
famous for something.

Capricorn (Dec 22-Jan 19): Hey, Capricorn
founds like candy corn! Isn’t that neat: Oh
well, no horoscope for you, cause you
didn’t like my rhyme.

Leo (July 23-Aug.22): It’s time to take those rotting fin­
gers out of the fridge and into your kettle The kids will be
here soon, and they want some treats!
Virgo (Aug 23-Sept. 22): Be original. Don’t wear a cop-out Halloween
costume tonight. No one is impressed by you taping a few balloons to your
chest and saying you’re a bag o f jellybeans.

Aquarius (Jan 20-Feb 18): Jeez Louise, you’re
ver 20 years old! It’s time to stop trick or treating. The
only reason you still get candy is cause all those old people
are scared o f you! Eat some Pal gum, jerky!
Pisces (Feb 19-March 20): Do something nice tonight, go to the local retirement
home, dress up like a zombie, and give the oldfogies a night to remember.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): This is your night! It’s finally here! You’ve wait

Men’s soccer ready to finish out year against top teams
By Brett Licata
Assistant S[forts Editor
The SIU E m en’s soccer team finish their regular
season this w eekend against the two top team s in the
G reat Lakes Valley Conference.
Saturday’s game will put SIUE up against the first place
team in the conference, Lewis, in Romeoville, 111.
Lewis is 11-2 overall with a GLVC m ark of 9-0.
They are ranked 14th in the nation and 4th in the
region. This is the first m eeting betw een the two
team s this season.
“They’re having an exceptional year,” head coach Ed

Huneke said “about Saturday’s opponent. “This game has
extensive implications on our post-season chances.”
The Cougars travel to Kenosha, Wi s. on Sunday to meet
the second place team in the GLVC, Wisconsin-Parkside.
SIU E will face the No. 18-ranked team in the
nation in another must win game.
“These are both huge games for us,” H uneke said.
“If we win both games, we still have a chance for
post-season play.”
Wins in these upcoming games will also help
SIU E to get a higher seed in the GLVC tournam ent
to start on W ednesday of next week.
“We have a m ajor challenge with trying to win

both games on the road,” H uneke said. “If we can
take advantage of their m istakes early, I think we’ll
rise to the occasion.”
The Cougars will look to sophomore Jake Ashley this
weekend, who has come on strong offensively as of late.
“I like the two way play of Jake,” H uneke said.
“H e wins a lot of balls at midfield, but he can also
add to our goal scoring. Jake scores the big goals
when we need them .”
SIU E will be w ithout defender B rett Darby for
the rem ainder of the season. H e suffered ligament
dam age in his left ankle that will keep him down.

Volleyball in stretch
run for tournament
Cougars travel to play first place Fort Wayne and then
move on to Indiana to face last place St. Joseph’s
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The stretch run is here for the SIU E volleyball team who will take to the
road for a couple of im portant G reat Lakes Valley C onference m atches over
the weekend.
The Cougars will first travel to Ft. Wayne, Ind. to take on IU PU -Ft. Wayne.
IU PU -Ft. Wayne is in first place in the Blue Division of the GLVC just
ahead of second place SIUE.
“We’re capable of winning,” head coach Sandy M ontgom ery said. “Talent
wise, we m atch up with them .”
M ontgom ery adm its that her team lacks the experience they need to beat
the tougher teams, but she thinks her players have gained a lot.
“We aren ’t the m ost experienced team ,” M ontgom ery said. “Being only
our second year, our team is m ade up of mostly freshm en and sophom ores
who lack the experience o f college matches.”
S IU E will move on to Rensselaer, Ind. to face St. Joseph’s, the last place
team in the Blue Division.
“We expect to beat them ,” M ontgom ery said. “B ut we can’t overlook
them. A nything can happen when you aren ’t playing well, so we hope to
come out and play strong.”
S IU E is looking to M ichelle Gilm an, who leads the GLVC in blocks and
kills, to contribute big num bers this weekend.
Yvonne Welsh, Julie L itteken and Jill Stenger should also step up for the
Cougars on offense.
“M ichelle has been the m ost consistent player for us all season long,”
M ontgom ery said. “If everyone plays hard, w e’ll be tough to stop.”
The Cougars would like to have a big turn out for their rem aining hom e
games against W ashington University on Tuesday, W isconsin-Parkside on
Friday Nov. 8 and Lewis on Saturday Nov. 9.
“We play well in front of a big crowd,” M ontgom ery said. “I hope that w e’ll
have a lot of support at hom e against these tough teams.”
The volleyball team would like to thank the m em bers of the SIU E Cross
Country team who came to support them in Quincy, 111. last weekend.

Post-Season up in the air for women’s soccer
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
The last two regular season games
will d eterm in e everything for the
SIU E w om en’s soccer team.
They should either win both games and
give the team a shot at playing in post sea­
son or lose one of the games and clean out
their lockers until next year.
“Everything is up in the air,” head
coach B rian K orbesm eyer said. “W e’re
still in the hunt.”
The 2-1 loss against the University
of Missouri-St. Louis last Saturday put
a question m ark on w hether o r not the

Cougars would m ake post season.
“It was a real good game. We hit the
crossbar three times. B ut we can’t get
down on ourselves and start to gripe. If
we continue to gripe ab o u t the
unlucky things that have happened,
then m ore than likely the outcom e of
the
gam e
will
be
unlucky,”
Korbesm eyer said.
But the Cougars are still in a tight
race to m ake the post season and one
of those team s is UM SL .
A fte r th e loss with U M SL
K orbesm eyer did the sam e thing he
does after every game, not much.
“In my eight years of coaching I

have never talked to the girls after a
win or a loss,” Korbesm eyer said. “The
thing is I ’m a sore loser and there are
things you say when you are em otion­
ally charged that you may n o t’ve said
when you have calmed down.”
The Cougars took three days off to
concentrate on their studies, and m ain­
ly to get their minds off of soccer for a
short time.
B ut the Cougars went back to work
yesterday
and
th at
is
w here
K orbesm eyer does his talking.
“1 haven’t prepared anything spe­
cial for the girls but I will tell them the
im portance of the next two games,”

Korbesm eyer said.
The Cougars received good news in
the past week when Janece Friederich
was nam ed player of the year in the
GLVC and M egan Beagles was nam ed
freshm an of the year.
The Cougars will play Ashland first
on Saturday and then W heeling-Jesuit
on Sunday.
The Cougars are now 14-3-2 and
two m ore wins could look good in the
final vote for post season.
“We have to win the final two
gam es,” K orbesm eyer said. “A nd a
16-3-2 record will give us a good shot.”
