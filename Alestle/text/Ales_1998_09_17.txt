Caution: Building rising
BY TRAVIS NUCKOLLS
NEWS STRINGER
Since the beginning of the
school year, there has been a
giant hole in the ground directly
in front of the Art and Design
Building.
Only now is it finally
starting to look like a structure
with some purpose. What you
are seeing is the beginning of the
new Engineering Building.
The building is a welcome
addition to the SIUE campus
because of the rising number of
students enrolled in engineering
programs. In 1968 there were
only two programs available in
the School of Engineering and
only 30 students. Now there are
seven undergraduate programs
and four graduate programs,
with a student body of 750.
Officials expect to add more
engineering programs.
The idea of adding an
engineering building has been
floating around administrative
offices for nearly 10 years. Work
on designs and preparing
bidding specifications as well as
actually selecting the contractor
took more than 18 months.

The design was finalized in
March. Construction began in
June and the building is
scheduled to be finished by
spring 2000 with classes being
held there in the fall of that year.
The estimated cost is just
over $28 million for the 60,000square-foot building. This price
tag
includes
equipment,
construction, labor and fees. The
building will meet all of the
physical requirements for the
school including classrooms,
research laboratories, conference
rooms
and
administrative
offices. It will also have large
areas for the display of
decorative
paintings
and
sculpture.
Among the specific types of
labs are ones designed for civil
engineering and construction
and
for
m echanical
and
industrial
and
electrical
engineering. O f course, there
will be computer labs and also a
robotics laboratory equipped
with voice - and video-sensing
robots.
An
environmental
laboratory will be used for
graduate research in the areas of
water and wastewater analysis.

SIUE M arketing Research asks the
question o f student pizza p referen ces
BY TAMARA S. KANO
NEWS STRINGER
During the past two weeks,
the Department of Marketing
Research at SIUE conducted a
survey in the University Center to
find out who the students think
has the best pizza. Students were
asked to choose their three
favorite restaurants out of Pizza
Hut, Imo's, Papa John's, Pizza
World, Domino's Pizza, Little
Caesar's and Pantera's Pizza.
Vicki
Nolle,
marketing
research assistant, said the survey
was conducted because there has
been an increasing interest in oncam pus pizza delivery
to

buildings such as the residence
halls. However, the contract
SIUE currently has with Pizza
Hut does not include delivery,
and just allows for the mini
pizzas to be m ade in the
University Center.
Nolle also stated that the
contract is good until next year,
so no matter what the result of the
survey, no changes can be made
prior to that.
"The survey was considered
a success," Nolle said. Marketing
received 167 responses, and staff
members are working on the
results. The figures will be
available next week.

Starting at 7 p.m. and
finishing at midnight, the
Friday event is open to all
students, faculty, staff and
their guests. All of the
activities will take place

behind the Commons Building
on Cougar Village Drive.
KJ Jackson is the Housing

‘Masterpieces of Central
Africa’ on display at
St. Louis Art Museum
BY KARA WOLF
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
The beauty of everyday objects from the Africa of more than a
century ago can be seen in the latest exhibit at the St. Louis Art
Museum.
"Masterpieces from Central Africa" consists of artifacts and
artworks visiting here from the Royal Museum for Central Africa,
curated by the Tervuren Museum in Belgium.
The exhibition, which opened Sept. 10, includes African
sculptural pottery, masks and figures, mostly from the Democratic
Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire. The Royal Museum was created
by King Leopold II in 1987 to hold artifacts collected in what was
then a Belgian colony. The museum is committed to the scientific
study of ethnographic artifacts, flora, fauna, and minerals from
Central Africa.
The "Masterpieces" include a silent past. Each was created to
fulfill a purpose specific to its native culture. In religion, ceremony
and daily life, tribal peoples created aesthetic forms to assist them
with work. Objects were fabricated for doing chores such as fetching
and carrying, as well as for use with magic rituals and curses.
These forms have inspired many generations of peoples, from
Americans of African descent to European and American artists.
African-Americans can find much to appreciate in these forms,
reaching into long-ago lands and heritage.
Their symbols and intents have generated much modem interest
in the ways of life of these ancient groups. European artists, such as
Pablo Picasso, have used African forms to create compositions of
great intrigue to the discipline of art. African masks were one
particular element Picasso experimented with in his cubist renderings.
This exhibit at the St. Louis Art Museum will run until Nov. 29
when it will travel to the Chicago Art Institute.
For a complete schedule of events call the museum at (314) 7210072. The hours are Tuesday 1:30-8:30 p.m. and Wednesday through
Sunday 10 a.m. to -5 p.m. Tuesday is still feature free admission.

U . S . e d i t o r s o b j e c t to i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l i s m e t h i c s c o n f e r e n c e
WASHINGTON
(AP)
American newspaper editors are
protesting an
international
journalism conference in Turkey
this weekend as "h o stile to press
freedom" because it aims to coifle
up with a worldwide code of
ethics.
The chief organizer at the World
Association of Press Councils,
Turkish new spaperm an Oktay
Eksi, says he hates government
interference with the press as
much as Americans do and is
offended by the A m erican
response.
Eksi accused the A m erican
Society of Newspaper Editors on
Tuesday of trying to stop the
conference that begins Saturday
in Istanbul without knowing its
goals.
Lee Stinnett, ASNE executive
director, who told Eksi in a letter
that his intent appears to be 'to
devise yet another collar for the
press," said the group has yet to

clearly state its intentions. He
said the Turkish government has
an abysmal record of repression
and media groups there should be
focusing on gaining freedom for
jailed journalists.
Edward Seaton, ASNE president,
said the group apparently wants
to come up with a code to which
all journalists should subscribe,
with some kind of enforcement
mechanism
to
m ediate
complaints across international
borders.
"T h ey are going out into deep
water, and it's water that they
shouldn't be sw im m ing in,"
Seaton said in a telephone
interview. He expressed similar
reservations about the conference
in an exchange of letters with
Eksi, who is senior columnist for
the widely circulated Hurriyet
newspaper in Istanbul and head
of the nongovernment Turkish
Press Council.
"T h e journalists of the world

will not and should not be
accountable to any self-appointed
group," Seaton wrote in an Aug.
19 letter to Eksi. " T h e y are
responsible only to the news
organizations that employ them,
which are in turn responsible to
their custom ers, the new s­
consuming public."
The conference runs through
Monday, with 220 delegates from
some 30 countries registered to
attend.
Among
them
are
journalists from Europe and the
United States who share ASNE's
concerns but chose to engage in
the debate over a media code.
Seaton said ASNE has taken the
tack that an international code of
ethics should not even be
proposed. He said it could be
adopted by courts and used
against a free press.
Tamer A tabarut, conference
coordinator, said the conference
will include panels on privacy,
war reporting, resolution of

"transnational
complaints"
against journalists and debate on
an international code of ethics for
media.
Eksi, who has worked for years
with the U.S.-based Committee
to Protect Journalists in efforts to
free jailed Turkish journalists,
said his organization has nothing
to do with governm ent and
receives all its funding from
media.
Ann K. Cooper, head o f the New
York-based committee, said that
while the organization shares
ASNE's concerns, Eksi is highly
respected in Turkey and has been
key in gaining access for
protection of Turkish journalists.
Eksi
cited
recent
ethical
problem s in U.S. journalism ,
including journalists who make
up stories. He accused U.S.
editors o f w anting to protect
American
journalists
from
meeting any kind of international
standards while wanting to tell

journalists in other countries how
to do their work.
"T hey claim ... we are trying to
be the tool of government which
we hate more than Mr. Seaton
arid others hate," Eksi said.
He said the goal of the
conference recognizes that in a
time when information is spread
rapidly around the globe, there is
a need for a new look at
worldwide journalistic ethics.
"T h is has become a very small
world, and we need to look at the
world from the global point of
view," he said, adding that any
enforcement under a journalistic
code of ethics would be
voluntary.
"L et's accept that journalism is
journalism. It's the same all over
the world. ... We try to achieve
the same goal, which is freedom
of expression," he said. "W hy
insult and accuse others without
knowing what they are doing?"

John Wayne tactics fail to save drunken camel driver from the law
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) — A
man accused of driving a team of
camels while drunk used John
Wayne-style techniques to resist
arrest, an Outback court heard
Monday.
In the Coober Pedy
Magistrate's Court, Ricky Wilson
Hall pleaded innocent to two
charges of drunk driving, one of
assaulting a police officer and
one of resisting arrest, the

Australian Broadcasting Corp.
reported.
Hall was driving a
wagon pulled by a number of
camels along the Oodnadatta
track in Septem ber last year
when police Sergeant Gary
Griffiths observed he was drunk
and warned him not to operate
his camel team, prosecutors
reportedly told the court.
Hall
ignored
the

warning and was later seen by
Griffiths still driving the team.
When Griffiths tried to
warn Hall again, the camel driver
struck the officer from behind,
the ABC reported the court as
being told.
A chase ensued, with
Hall jumping onto a young camel
in an attempt to escape.
But afraid of being
away from older members of its

family, the camel turned back
after a short distance and headed
back towards the wagon and
Griffiths, the ABC quoted
prosecutors as saying.
Hall then jumped onto
the wagon in John Wayne
fashion, yelling “Yahoo, yahoo!”
prosecutors said.
Hall was eventually
arrested after being sprayed with
debilitating capsicum spray.

Laughs for the thoughtless
If a black man writes it, a
black man produces it and another
black man stars in it, can it still be
racist? Can black people perpetuate
the same racism toward their peers
Danielle
*s inflicted upon them?
B elton
My mother, the big old-school
liberal that she is, asked me earlier
this summer if I’d heard about some TV network
making a comedy about a slave. I looked up
from the TV and thought, “There she goes
again.” I didn’t believe her when she first told
me. What self-respecting network would take
the business risk of making a show about slavery
and make it a comedy? Most networks don’t
even bother to invest in black shows, let alone
controversial ones. I went back to watching
music videos. Then, on a trip to Arkansas in
August, I saw a commercial for a new TV show
on the UPN (a competitor of the WB). The
advertised show fit my m other’s description. I
was surprised.
The United Paramount Network doesn’t
have an affiliate in St. Louis, but there are
around 140 affiliates in the country and all will
be carrying this new sitcom, “The Secret Life of
Desmond Pfieffer.” The show is getting much
publicity because of its controversial story line.
The action takes place during the Civil War in
Washington, D.C. Chi McBride plays Desmond,
a British nobleman who becomes President
Lincoln’s closest and most important adviser. Of
course, he's not actually an adviser, blacks
didn’t hold such positions in the White House at
that time. He’s the butler. UPN has stated that the
show will not contain any racist images and
proclaimed that it does not find humor in
slavery. Then, UPN listed nicely all the black
people who helped make this possible.
Please.
I have been defending black comedy to my
mother for the longest time. She hates the WB
and constantly is hard on comedians Jamie Foxx
and M arlon and Shawn Wayans for their raunchy
brand of comedy — what she calls embarrassing
buffoonery. But what I see as good physical
comedy is not always funny, but solid. This time,
I am going to have to agree with her: Some
things just aren’t funny.
Producers of the show contend that it is
similar to the ’80s show “Benson,” which starred
Robert Guillaume as an adviser to a dimwitted
governor. They even have one of the AfricanAmericans who worked with “Benson” as one of
the consulting producers. They can name as
many blacks on their staffs as they like. So a few
black people thought it would be OK; no one
polled the entire race. Ward Connelly believes
affirmative action should be ended, but not every
black person agrees with him. If we all agreed,
getting over the Civil War and slavery might not
have taken so long. Just because you know a

black person who doesn't mind being called a
Negro every now and then, please don’t think all
black people like to be referred to as such.
Another point the producers made was that
the question o f slavery would hardly be
mentioned in the show. The show is supposed to
focus on the Civil War and an 1800s Benson
advising a “goofy “Abraham Lincoln. Maybe
they didn't brush up on their history, but the
Civil War was the bloodiest war in American
history. Also, you cannot separate slavery from
the Civil War, since the institution played a
pivotal role in what led up to the war. It was the
imbalance of free states and slave states in the
Senate and in the Union that helped lead to the
Civil War. There were stronger feelings than the
Democratic or Republican parties of today could
ever have in the Senate at that time. Fights broke
out on the floor of Congress over the tension and
fear that there would be more free-state senators
than slave-state. More Americans died in the
Civil War than in any other, and there are more
unresolved issues with race relations due to the
Civil War and its aftermath than to any other
event in our history.
The star and a producer from the show
appeared on “BET Tonight,” a news-talk show
on the Black Entertainment Network. Both
defended the show saying that there have been
com edies that take place during wars.
“M*A*S*H” is a good example. But slavery and
the Civil War are something still painful for
many people in this country. Also, “M*A*S*H”
would have been a different show if it were done
from the perspective of the Koreans, and I don’t
think the Koreans would have wanted it to be a
comedy. Also, you don’t see Jewish people
making comedies about Auschwitz and Nazi
death camps. There aren’t any sitcoms about
Native Americans being pushed from their
homelands to live in virtual deserts. There aren’t
any comedies about Middle passage, the Irish
potato famine, Bosnia or Vietnam. And there
shouldn’t be any. To ignore the pain and hurt
associated with the people and their ancestors
who lived through it is thoughtless and cruel.
Even the best-treated slaves ran away from
their masters. It w asn’t because they were
unhappy or because they were treated cruelly.
They didn’t have control over their- own
destinies, they couldn't control whether they
would enjoy this life today or watch their family
or themselves to be sold tomorrow.
Some people say black people should get
over slavery. The point is not getting over, it’s
not forgetting. A people should never forget
where they came from or what tragedies they
had to face. It’s obvious someone out there has
forgotten.

C o m m e n t a r y ------------------------------

The good, the bad and the GOP
Republican Party Chairman
Steve Curtis made some unseemly
remarks the other day, saying two
lawmakers, Rep. Steve Johnson of
Fort Collins and Rep. Bill Kaufman
of Loveland “are not good
Republicans” because they sided
against him.
The two-sided with Larimer
County’s Republican bigwigs, who
suggested Curtis step down,
believing he was interfering with
GOP primary races and giving too
much support to the religious right.
Curtis may not like Johnson
and Kaufman, but a lot of other
people, on both sides of the
political aisle, do.
Both
are
good,
solid
Republicans; good humored, smart,
conservative about some things and
moderate on others. Kaufman has
taken more political beatings from
his own party than Johnson, but
he’s been around longer.
They think government ought
to stay out of peoples’ lives, and
that includes excessive taxes and
meddling in abortion. Neither likes
abortion. As a matter of fact, not
even Democrats like abortion. But
abortion is an individual, personal
matter, they think.
Curtis’s remark about Johnson
and Kaufman points to the “goodRepublican,
bad-Republican”
agony the party is going through.
Prior to the chairman’s election
a num ber of party members
feared if Curtis won the party
would change, not necessarily for
the better.
At the party’s state assembly
on May 30, Curtis said “principles
are
something
you
never
compromise.” He said President
Reagan's “big tent” did not mean
that “regardless o f what you
believe, you can call yourself a
Republican.”
In other words, all Republicans
are equal, but some are more equal
than others, and if you are not
equal, you had better find yourself
another party.
In the wake of that, the party’s
executive
cluster
has
been
reorganized. There have been
public exchanges over policy,
which is good. There have been
vendettas, which are bad.

Now, it is suspected there is an
enemies list somewhere, with those
who have dared to differ with
Curtis making up the bulk of the
names. In addition to Johnson and
Kaufman are Rep. Marcy Morrison
of M anitou Springs, and Rep.
Tambor Williams of Greeley and
probably a bunch of others.
M orrison has accused the
leadership of a covert campaign
aimed at unseating moderate
Republican legislators. Williams
wasn’t as vocal as Morrison, but
she saw herself being spied on at
the Statehouse and at home, and
heard the whispers about her liberal
reputation. She ignored all that,
campaigned hard and got past her
primary.
She and Morrison face tough
Democratic
opposition
in
November, and they’re getting little
help from the party because they
had the audacity to talk back.
Other Republicans also have
taken on Curtis and former
executive director Chris Baker.
Curtis fired Baker before the
primary.
Baker accused Curtis, a
conservative
Christian,
of
organizing “deep cover” operations
for several years to load races with
conservative candidates.
Baker said a Washington, D.C.,
company provided voter lists to
identify conservative voters. Those
voters then were sent cards asking
them to attend caucuses, and party
leaders also were sent the cards to
help hide the scheme. Moderate
voters did not receive the postcards,
he said.
Curtis has publicly called any
Republican who supports abortion
rights “intellectually dishonest.” He
once
challenged
moderate
lawmakers to a “holy war.”
Mr. Curtis is now in a war that
is anything but holy, because it is
with his own people. It won’t be
settled soon and Republicans, who
are looking for a big election year,
may find the sweetness of victory
tinted with the bitterness of party
fighting that could go on until the
next party election.

morning.
Valued at $10,000, the 32foot-tall bowl had been placed
atop the market to promote the
Smart Health Challenge, a
community health initiative
scheduled
to
begin
on
Wednesday.
Capt. George Lang said
Monday that police believe the
thieves used a ladder to get on
the market's roof and remove the
bowl. There are no suspects, he
said.
M arket
owner
Ken
Gronbach said he couldn't

imagine how anyone could have
removed the bowl without
having been seen.
“It’s like stealing the
Goodyear Blimp,” he said. “We
hope its a prank. But being worth
$10,000, its grand theft.”
The Smart Heart Challenge
is being sponsored by Main
Street
M iddletown
Inc.,
Middlesex Hospital and The
Quaker Oats Company. It is a
30-day program intended to
show people that a simple
dietary change of eating oatmeal
daily can have an impact on their
health and cholesterol level.
More
than
150
area
residents have agreed to take
part in the health initiative by
eating a daily bowl of oatmeal
for a month. Participants will
have their cholesterol level
checked at the beginning and
end of the challenge.

RAV€S

BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
cstu lce @ siu e.ed u

Mick Jagger is a lying,
English rat-bastard.
Time is not on my side, no
it’s not.
Time seems to be working
against me and cackling all the
way. You see, time realizes that
there’s not enough of him to go
around, the selfish jerk. No
matter how you slice it or dice it,
time catches up with you. I
haven’t realized that as much as
I have this semester. For some
reason, I feel like I’m always
running out of it.
I’m either running late for
work, not getting enough sleep,
cramming to get my homework
done or trying to squeeze five
short minutes of “special” time
for myself. O f course, sacrifices
need to be made. And
unfortunately, those sacrifices
usually come out of the latter.
It doesn’t help that I’m a huge
procrastinator. I’m that person
who says, “Hey, I can visit Great
Uncle Lou in the hospital
tomorrow. H e’s hooked up to
machines after all.” I also try to
convince myself that I can study
for a final exam on the toilet.
You know, the whole killing two
birds with one kidney stone
axiom.
I am always looking for ways
to save time, only to waste the
time I save. I consider my social
time as essential to stay sane in
my busy world, so I try to milk
as much as I can out of it. I
figure that if I can endure the
five weekdays of pure hell, I can
live it up on the weekends.
But the weekends soar by like
the Flash on crystal meth and the
weekdays drone on like the
Clinton/Starr papers. So, where’s
the solution?

BY LEIGH RAMSEY
FOR THE ALESTLE
Review o f 7 A m Jackie Chan:
M y Life in A c tio n ’
by Jackie Chan with J e ff Yang
It isn’t a literary masterpiece.
It isn’t a picture book, though it
does contain some pictures. It
doesn’t speak with Jackie Chan’s
distinct voice and style. It is,
however, the definitive Jackie
Chan autobiography. In fact, it is
the
only
Jackie
Chan
autobiography.
No
selfrespecting “Chan Fan” would be
without it. And anyone looking
for a good, entertaining read
should pick it up.
I Am Jackie Chan is a
surprisingly well-written book as
autobiographies go, especially
considering Chan is by no stretch
o f the im agination a fluent
English speaker. His fans love

him,
though,
because
he
transcends
boundaries
—
language, race and nationality.
Chan communicates through
graceful, acrobatic martial arts
techniques and dangerous stunts.
It is rumored that Chan can
neither write nor read English, so
ghost writer Jeff Yang stepped in,
creating
some
discontinuities, at
least according to
the fans I know.
True, many times
Chan’s voice
is
drowned out by his
translator and writer.
From time to time,
u n c h a ra c te ris tic
sentences such as
“Hong Kong ... has
always been a place
... where the devout
and diabolical have
tipped their hats to
one another when
passing
in
the
street”
(21)
crop up.
T h e

problem is that this native
speaker of Chinese can’t use
metaphors in English, but his
ghostwriter does. Instead, Chan
lets his body movements do the
talking. Somehow when Chan
demonstrates a punch or sings an
Elvis tune or strikes a kung fu
stance, it says more than his

broken English can.
But this book does stay in
touch, for the most part, with
what you might call the spirit of
Chan — that feeling of Jackie’s
personality
you
get
from
watching his movies.

Say What!?!
What do you think Bill Clinton
will do if he is impeached?

“What’s Hillary gonna
do? He’s just gonna do
the same damn thing
he’s been doing.”
-Emily Nowlan,
Sophomore, Sociology

CHAN------------------------------“He will look for
revenge.”
-ZiZi Chirwa,
Sophomore, Electrical
Engineering

“He’ll probably have to
resolve some problems
with Hillary.”
-Kelly Bruner, Junior,
Mass Communications

from page 6

He speaks candidly about life as a pupil in a
Chinese Opera school. Without flinching, he talks
about the canings that were given to students and
the bullying of younger children by the older ones.
One time, a student passed out from overexertion
and was unconscious for several hours. The students
practiced singing, acrobatics, martial arts and more
from 5 a.m. to 12 a.m. every day.
Humorous and sentimental segments have their
place in the book also, especially as Chan speaks about
his first parting with his parents. He makes you believe,
using colorful anecdotes about how his mother carried
boiling water in bags across town to his school so he
could take baths once a week.
“Every child,” he comments, “thinks his mother is
the best in the world, but my mother is the greatest.”
Signature Chan humor also abounds in the book,
particularly when Chan is making jest of himself. At one
point, he quips, “I could have been the world’s most
famous doctor, .instead of the world’s most famous
patient (referring to his many movie- and stunt-related
injuries).”
Chan’s love of homeland and family are lucidly
evoked as he speaks of the sun rising over Victoria

wife, or everybody in

Hartjor in Hong Kong, lighting the sky like a glowing
treasure.
About his days at the opera school and Chinese
culture, he has this to say: “It may seem strange that such
a young child [age 7] would be learning how to fight.
You have to remember, though, that to us Chinese, kung
fu isn’t just a means of self-defense. In some ways, the
history of kung fu is the histoiy of China.”
Not only will you get a brief Chinese history lesson,
but you also will be entertained. You gain insight into
Asian culture and into Chan himself. At times, it will feel
as if you’ve discovered some secret journal entries or
overheard pieces of private family conversations.
Chan also breaks the silence about his marriage and
his son, as well as about first loves and love affairs.
Even if you have never seen a Jackie Chan movie,
you can pick up this hardback book and read it quickly.
You will learn something from this book — maybe even
something about human courage, dignity and the will to
succeed.

Janece Friederich, No. 12, and the rest o f the women’s soccer team will look
to recover from a 3-0 loss to Lynn University, ranked third nationally.

Quick hits around sports T here are a lot o f issues out th ere th a t I
w ant to cover, so here we go ...
— T he C ubs co u ld m ake the playoffs, and
Sosa could w in th e MVP. Is fam ine or
pestilence n ex t?
— N ot even K en n eth S tarr could bring
dow n B arry Sanders.
— O p tim ism : T he R am s co u ld have
b eaten th e V ikings if th e y ’d had tim e for
one m o re play.
— W hen did M ark B runnell becom e Joe
M ontan a?
— Will an y o n e pick the M izzouri Tigers
o v er No. 1 O h io S tate this w eekend w ith a
25-point sp read?
— R ealism : tu rn o v e rs, bad pen alties,

sloppy player m an agem ent. T he R am s
again shot them selves in the foot.
— A fter listening to D ivision 1 football
coaches com plaining ab o u t to u g h n o n ­
conference opponents early in th e season,
I give a nod to S IU E coaches Sandy
M o n tg o m e ry
(v o lley b all)
B ria n
K orbesm eyer (w om en’s soccer) and E d
H u n e k e (m e n ’s soccer) for tak in g on all
com ers. T hanks to a to ugh conference
schedule, b u t m ore im p o rtan tly playing
n a tio n a lly re co g n ized n o n c o n fe re n c e
opponents, each team has given itself a
chance to m ake a run at post-season play.
This has w orked o u t best for the volleyball
tea m , w ho is 10-1 on th e se aso n and
p lay in g w ith co n fid en ce a fte r b e a tin g

som e ran k ed team s. T he ju ry is still out on
w o m en ’s soccer, as th ey are 1-1 after
playing tw o tough team s. The schedule was
m ost^unkind to th e m e n ’s soccer team ,
th at faced som e b a d b reak s against ranked
team s. N ow at 1-3 on th e season, th ey face
m ust-w in situ atio n s this w eekend as they
begin conference play.
— R oger C lem ens gets my vote for th e A L
Cy Young aw ard.
— W ould we be this excited if the hom e
run race was b etw ee n B arry B onds and
A lb ert Belle?
— D o you think Joe T orre is upset about
being run o u t of St. L ouis?
— Life after B re tt H ull has started at the

weakness in the defen se this year, which has them giving up an
average of over th ree goals p er game in their first five contests.
The C ougars will look to exploit this w eakness with heavy
offensive pressure led by sen io r Janece Friederich, ju n io r M egan
Beagles and freshm an Leslie H enigm an. Last season, S IU E
dom inated W isconsin-Parkside in a lopsided 5-0 victory.
‘•When we play W isconsin-Parkside at hom e we have been
very successfull b u t it seem s like w henever we play on the road,
m aybe it is th e seven h o u r ride, we don’t seem to play o u r best.
A nd it will be the first ro a d trip o f the year.”
D espite th e 1-4 reco rd this season, W isconsin-Parkside has
som ething th a t S IU E d o e sn ’t ... th ree m ore gam es played this
season. This experience edge could be a factor in a close game.
S IU E ’s next stop will be in R om eoville to take on Lewis
U niversity o n Sunday aftern o o n .
Lewis (2-2-1) will pose m o re of a th reat to the C ougars as they
com e into this w eek en d a fte r winning their last two games. S IU E
will also have to co n te n d w ith th e GLVC P layer of the W eek, Lily
Alcala, who scored five goals and added tw o assists in the Flyers’
two victories a w eek ago. T he Cougars split a pair o f gam es
against Lewis last season.
H ead coach B rian K o rbesm eyer needs just th ree victories for
career win No. 100 at S IU E .
K orbesm eyer c o u ld n ’t close th e gap on th at m ilestone last
w eekend as the C ougars fell to the No. 3 ranked team in the
nation, Lynn, 3-0.
Lynn out-sh o t S IU E 20-7. Freshm an goalkeeper Shannon
R oth stopped 10 shots to allow the Cougars to hang around in a
2-0 gam e b efore a n o th e r insurance goal in the 81st m inute sealed
the victory for Lynn.

from page 10

D ad taught m e how to k e e p score. H e taught m e how to tie a pen
to my glove and d ro p it o v er the outfield wall to get one o f the
outfielders, m aybe C u rt F lo o d or Joe Cunningham , to sign it and
throw it back to me.
We w atched S tan M usial swing for the fences. We w atched Bob
G ibson throw steam an d L ou Brock fly. We m arched in the
parade to th e new Busch Stadium , saw the old stadium com e
down.
Six m onths before D ad died, the C ardinals w ere in a long
aw aited W orld Series. By this tim e, I was grow n-up and could give
som ething back to my dad.
H e and M om w ere in Indianapolis visiting relatives. I called
him on the phone.
“How soon can you get back to St. L ouis?” I asked. “ I have
tickets for you an d M om for to n ig h t’s gam e.”
Before th e first C lydesdale set foot on the field for pre-gam e
cerem onies. D ad and M om w ere sitting in their seats with the
oth er 50,000 p eople a t th e park. Bruce Sutter and the rest o f the
C ardinals b ro u g h t th e cham pionship hom e th at night.
The day the hom e run reco rd was broken, I held my b reath
every tim e M cG w ire swung. W hen he hit that glorious shot into
the stands, I ju m p ed up an d scream ed. B ut I w asn’t p re p a re d for
the tears th a t stream ed o u t o r the rush of em otion th at follow ed
the joy.
M aybe it was w atching the M aris children honoring the
m em ory o f th e ir fath er. M aybe it was w atching M cG w ire
em brace his son. All I know is th at one person was missing who
should have been there.
It has been 15 years since my D ad died. I thought the grief was
behind me. It was not until I saw those im ages th at I realized you
never really put it b ehind you. H om e runs and heroes. Fathers
and baseball.
