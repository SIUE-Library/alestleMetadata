■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
The A lestle has been
form ally handed over to the
Departm ent
of
Mass
Communications.
Formerly under the Office of
Student Affairs, the newspaper
was returned to the department in
hopes of improving its overall
journalistic quality.
Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs, Narabeth Emmanuel, and
M ass Com m unications Chair,
Ralph Donald agreed that the
change was for the better.
Donald noted that by the
Alestle being part of the Mass
Com m unications
departm ent,
there will be help with staff
shortages that have plagued the
Alestle. During the summer, the
employee roster dropped to six
on its editorial staff The Alestle
has had chronic staff problems
with recruiting and keeping

quality employees. With the
department’s direct involvement,
Donald said he believes this
problem can be solved.
Donald said that by keeping
the paper fully staffed, section
editors can now focus more on
improving the paper along with
better campus coverage.
Emmanuel said he felt the
change was necessary, adding
that the Departm ent of Mass
Comm unications is a more
appropriate overseer for the
Alestle.
Emmanuel said he felt the
Alestle lacked two things to be
successful.
He
said
the
newspaper should be part of a
good journalistic program and
should have a “pool of good
confident writers.”
Emmanuel said that with
new direction and D onald’s
wealth
of
experience
in
journalism, the Alestle and its

readers will be well served.
The change was brought
about after several months of
planning that eventually lead to
the acquistion of the newspaper
by the departm ent of Mass
Com m unications
and
the
term ination of form er Alestle
adviser Terrance Signorello.
The D epartm ent of Mass
Com m unications
appointed
veteran
journalist,
Mike
Montgomery, an instructor in the
departm ent. M ontgom ery has
more than 20 years of experience
in the journalism field. He was
the city editor of the now-defunct
St. Louis Globe-Democrat and
was most recently the editor of
the Telegraph in Alton from 1989
to 1994. He recieved a masters in
mass com m unications from
SIUE in 1997.
The Alestle will continue to
be headquartered in the Office of
Student Publications, Room
2022, Morris University Center.

A new day at
the ALESTLE
It’s that time of year
again. Either most of us are
dreading it or looking forward
to the begining o f a new
semester. I find myself both
Danielle eagar and wonderous about
Belton
the possibilities a new school
year may bring.
This summer the A lestle went
through several changes. Once part of the
Office of Student Affairs, the Alestle has
been transferred to the Department of
Mass Communications. And, the Alestle
now has a new adviser, Michael
Montgomery, a professor in the mass
communications department. He has more
than 20 years in mass media, most of it as
a new spaper reporter and editor. He
earned his m aster’s degree here at SIUE.
With these changes, both the Alestle
and
the
departm ent
of
Mass
Communications expect to work together
to produce the best journalistic effort
possible. With the department on our side,
we expect the newspaper will get the help
it needs to give the readers the publication
they have always wanted, one that would
be worthy enough to be read from cover to
cover. We hope to be a periodical that will
win back the trust and respect it should
have. It should be a newspaper that serves
its readership, the entire campus
community, in the best way possible with
better coverage and more colorful, indepth stories.
With these goals we hope to regain
the respect and credibilty that has been
lost over the years at the Alestle. Like the
phoenix, from the ashes, the Alestle will
rise to a new era of creativity, originality
and credibility.
I hope you enjoy the survival guide,
and, like me, are looking forward to more
editions of a newspaper that truly serves
the interests of this special community.

To the students of SIUE:

NCAA Division II Great Lakes
Valley
Conference
has
garnered our first All Sports
Trophy, symbolic of the best
overall sports program in the
conference.
Yes, there exists a wide
range of activities. But with
the growth of the University’s
residency hall offerings, and
with the general growth of
our University, it’s time for
us all to take a look at how
we create an ever more
vibrant campus culture.
So, as I welcome you
all to the academic year, I
put this challenge before
you: If the organizational
support were there, if the
funding existed, if the
permission. were granted,
what sorts o f programs,
offerings
or
facilities
would you like to see?
What do we need in order
to create for all SIUE
students a well-rounded,
energetic
campus
environment
to
complement our existing
and outstanding academic
programs? As we see this
shift away from being
primarily a commuter
campus, what do you think
it would take to create a
cohesive community based
as liiuch on academic
accomplishment and pride
as on a vital campus
lifestyle? The University
itself can produce some of
the answers to these
questions. But, I am most
interested in what students
are looking for here.
There
are
many
forums and channels at
SIUE through which you
can express your thoughts,
not the least of which is
this newspaper.
The
Alestle has a history of
representing the often
widely differing opinions

Since 1968, it has been
my privilege, in one capacity
or another, to welcome
students to SIUE. With the
start of each academic year, I
have had the opportunity to
pause and consider the changes
this campus has experienced,
the challenges it has met and
the opportunities that lie ahead.
As I welcome both new and
returning students to campus, I
can’t help but be excited by the
latest
chapter
in
this
U niversity’s
evolutionary
history — a chapter that you,
the students, will have a
prominent role in.
I don’t think it has escaped
anyone’s notice that, for the
last year, a new residence hall
has been rising just south of
Woodland Hall.
With the
opening of Prairie Hall, we
welcome 500 new “residents”
to the SIUE campus. This is
another step toward building
an identity as a commuter and
residential university. Our new
residence hall also represents
an opportunity to continue our
progress toward developing a
more active and diverse “oncampus lifestyle.”
Not that there doesn’t
already exist a dynamic range
of opportunities for students —
both residential and commuter
— to explore and participate
in:
A
multitude
of
organizations, associations,
and clubs of which to be a part;
a range o f performance
possibilities, either as audience
member or performer; what is
surely one of the finest and
most extensive recreational
programs of any Illinois state
university;
. and
an
intercollegiate
athletic
program that offers the
majority of its events free of
charge.
In the past year,
SIUE’s participation in the

students put themselves in that
situation, but when fines go
unpaid and accumulate, problems
occur for the neglectful students.
When people do n ’t buy
decals, “They just keep getting
tickets and keep getting tickets,”
Vanzo said. “Usually when (I)
find out is when som eone’s
having
a severe
financial
hardship.”
Vanzo noted that Financial
Aid will pay parking ticket debt.
While this creates more time for
the students to get their act
together, it removes funds that
could be used for tuition.
To explain why some
students and staff play the “ticket
game” with SIUE parking service
workers is relatively easy — most
think they can get away with it.
On any day, a walk through
an SIUE parking lot reveals a
discarded ticket or two that
someone has removed from the
car. Vanzo said he believes some
' students feel they may not be
caught or they may think the
university will do nothing about
an unpaid parking ticket or two.
This attitude o f “it’s not
going to happen to me” leads to

the price is too high, with stickers
ranging from $60 to $110. A
parking decal for Cougar Village
costs $60, the same as what most
students pay for parking on the
fan lots around the campus.
While some might complain,
Vanzo noted that the cost of a
decal is minimal compared to the
debt in ticket fines repeat
offenders could be racking up.
W7en ticket fines grow too
large to handle, the B ursar’s
Office can help students and staff
set up payment plans adjusted for
their individual budgets. The
largest debts have ranged in the
thousands. One recent debt by a

nonstudent was around $7,200.
There is another reason for
the cost of parking stickers and
the vanishing free parking spaces
on campus. The new pavement
on all the parking lots wasn’t
free.
A ccording to Vanzo, the
state of Illionis offers no funds
for parking lot repairs. All the
money used for the 1998 widescale parking lot and road
resurfacing program came from
parking meters, pay lots, parking
tickets and parking decal sales.

EDITOR IN CHIEF
To walk the streets of
Babylon for the first time. All
your life you’ve been living in
the security of your parents’
homes and lives they made for
you. Here’s your chance to prove
you can really make it on your
own ... so grab yourself a beer.
Although SIUE’s first year
student retention is around 86
percent, it leads a person to
wonder what happend to the
other 14 percent. After all, many

of the people SIUE’s freshmen
start out with won’t be returning
sophomore year.
It’s not that students come to
college expecting to gain 15
pounds, flunk out of classes and
develop a few bad habits along
the way, it’s just too many lose
track of their responsiblities
when, for the first time, there is
no one to force them to be
responsible.
“There isn’t any transition in
our society (for students out of
high school),”
said Marvin
Peterson of SIUE Counseling
Services. “I d o n ’t think high
school students have a good

understanding of how to handle
college.”
The top five reasons students
come to Counseling Services for
help is relationships, stress,
depression, academic concerns
and financial woes. For a student
away from home for the first time
classes can become intimidating.
Also lonliness, homesickness and
long-distance relationships with
boyfriends or girlfriends from
high school can be equally
stressing.
These problems can lead to a
lack of sleep o r to weight loss,
both which could affect a
student’s class performance.

Peterson also said that one of
the major problems students have
is learning how to handle time.
Before parents and guardians set
the times for coming in at night.
Their high schools set times for
going to classes. Peterson said he
believes with students left with
an entire day for only them to
decide what they will do leads to
a mentality of “I can do anything
I want.” That anything doesn’t
always include classes.

making leads to many of the
failing
grades
and
discouragem ent students feel
their first year.
The vice chancellor for
student affairs, Dr. Narbeth
Emmanuel, said he believes
students need to learn how to
balance school and social
activity, as well as to establish a
new kind of relationship with
their familes to enable them to be
more of a support system.
“Students need to know that

it’s important to socialize, go to
parties, but ... they need to be
able to balance,” Emmanuel said.
Emmanuel suggests that
each student see the professors
and advisers to make a midterm
assessment to find out where they
are academ ically and to help
identify any potential problems.
Both
Peterson
• and
Emmanuel suggest finding the
right peer groups and utilizing the
different support groups on
campus in order to insure that
their first year is a success.
“If we can just get students
to use the reasources we can help
many of them,” Emmanuel said,
“The more we know of them (the
students) the easier it is to
develop a plan.”
Peterson also wanted to pass
the message along that it is OK to
be bored and to not let that
boredom dictate how students
handle their classes.
“To 18-year-olds, boredom
is the worst thing, (but) classes
aren’t supposed to be exciting,”
Peterson said.

P lea se d o n 't call it a dorm itory ...

■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
University Housing Director
Michael Schultz would like to tell
you that it’s not a dormitory, it’s a
residence hall. The difference
you ask?
“A residence hall has life ...
it has cable and data jacks,”
Schultz said. “Dormitories never
have that.”
The attitude
must be
working
because
freshman
enrollment is up, applications for
housing are still com ing in,
Prairie Hall is ready for business
and both residence halls are full.
Since its opening in 1994,
Woodland Hall has helped make
SIUE one of the hottest schools
in the state thanks to its state-ofthe-art facilities and technologyfilled rooms.
The growth in housing is
more apparent than ever with the
number of students living on

campus this year totaling
between 2,300 and 2,400. A large
improvement over last year when
the numbers were around 1,900.
This year Prairie Hall will be
home to at least 500 students,
offering them a chance to take
part in campus life.
Schultz said that years
before construction was begun,
administrators studied data and
learned that some students chose
not to come to SIUE “because we
didn’t have a residence hall.”
Due to SIUE’s increasing
popularity, 40 freshmen will
again be placed in Cougar
Village. Schultz said he hopes
that in the future there will be
enough residence hall housing so
no freshmen will be put in
Cougar Village.
Although things are tight,
Schultz said the situation could
be worse. The administration had
planned on renovating Cougar
Village, but the work has been
put on hold.

“If w e’d stayed on target
with the first plan, w e’d be
overbooked,” Schultz said.
Schultz said that University
Housing is still dedicated to
renovating Cougar Village.
Those plans, Schultz said,
will allow the university to utilize
the facilites for the next 20 years.
After that, he said, the facility
will be tom down and a new
apartment complex will be built
on top of it. Cougar Village is
more than 20 years old.
Schultz said it is a prority to
keep the apartment housing for
undergraduate and graduate

students and their families.
There are plans in the works to use the library and later on,
for a third residence hall. The how to prepare for midterms and
third will be a hybrid between the finals.
Schultz said he is excited
two traditional residence halls
and Cougar Village with suites about the many changes in the
that will be more like apartments University’s living styles and is
looking forward to more, positive
than dorm rooms.
Prairie Hall is for only changes in the near and distant
freshmen while Woodland Hall future.
There are just a few things
has both freshmen and upper
class students. Woodland Hall still to be done at the newer
also offers Focused Interest residence hall — the computer
lab, resource center and multi­

(wellness), languages,
business,

The residence halls
are offering a series of
programs
to
help
incoming freshmen deal
with
their
new
surroundings.
The program series
entitled, “Real Life” will
feature topics to help
students manage life on
their own on campus.
Some of the topics to be
featured in the series are:

Instructional Services
offers a bit of advice
Welcome to SIUE and your
fall term classes. Probably some
of the last advice your families
gave you before you left for
school this fall were: go to class,
do your homework and get some
help if you have trouble in any of
your classes. While I want to
echo that advice, I particularly
want to focus on getting help for
any of your classes.
That is where Instructional
Services plays a role in your
education.
First, if you get into a class
that seems too easy for you, you
may be able to receive credit for it
through proficiency or CLEP
exams. Stop by, and we will talk
about the exams available to you.
Second, most of your classes
will involve some written
assignm ents.
If you want to
discuss your ideas, review a draft,
or become more proficient in the
m echanical aspects o f your
writing, make an appointment for
a conference or stop by the
Writing Center (Peck 1419) to
work on some grammar modules.

You may want to stay ahead
of your math and science classes,
If so, come to the Math Resource
Area (Peck 1414) or get involved

We will also
m aintain a list (should be

If you are in Academic
Development classes, you have
an opportunity to refine skills that
will make you a success in your
other courses.
Use that
opportunity to the fullest! If you
are floundering in a course,
perhaps you need us.

A welcome back letter
from SIUE Housing

Discover
Scuba Oiving and

PiV<s dT<srrt<sr

P age 1 1

The staff at University
Housing proudly welcomes all
students back for an exciting fall
sem ester at SIUE! This is
certainly an exciting time for
University Housing. With the
opening of Prairie Residence
Hall, more than 2,300 students
now live in University Housing.
For the first time, the majority of
the incoming freshman class
resides on campus.
Why are so many people
deciding to stay on campus?
According to several studies,
those who choose to live on
campus are making the wisest
decision. These studies have
found that college students who
live on campus are more likely to
graduate, more likely to be
involved
in
student
organizations, have higher self­
esteem
and confidence in
themselves and are more satisfied
with
their
total
college
experience. By staying in
University Housing, students can
meet their individual needs and
stay in touch with the dynamic
atmosphere
and
expanding
opportunities SIUE has to offer.
The wide variety of housing
options at SIUE makes it easier
for students to choose a living
style that supports their needs. At
Prairie Residence Hall, facilities
and services are geared toward
students just starting their college
careers. Programs are offered to
support the developmental needs
o f these new students. At
W oodland
Residence
Hall,
freshmen through seniors live
to g e th e r in the same building.
Many o? these students are

Com m unities where students
with similar academically-based
interests reside together in the
same area. Programs and services
are provided that challenge these
students and involve them deeply
in their areas o f interest. At
Cougar Village, single student
and family residents live in
apartment settings with services
and facilities provided to support
more independent students who
may be deciding on careers and
making other life choices.
When you ask students why
they live on campus, they give
many different reasons. Some
may want to stay close to friends;
some want to be close to classes
and campus; still others find
University Housing to be the
most affordable option ... there
are literally hundreds of reasons.
One thing that most have in
common, however, is a strong
commitment to SIUE. Those who
reside in Woodland Hall, Cougar
Village and now Prairie Hall are
greatly responsible for a new
energy building on campus. They
are participating in campus
activities and getting involved in
student groups. SIUE is their
home, and they are choosing to
make it the best home possible.
As
we
celebrate
the
beginning of the fall semester, we
at University Housing also
celebrate
the
contribution
residential students make to
SIUE. We are proud o f our
students and the difference they
are making in our university
community.

Director of University Housing

Buildings, buildings everywhere
What’s where on campus?
You don’t have to walk around dumbfounded when
trying to find the less obvious places on campus. Sure
everyone knows where the University Center is. but where
are they hiding that “cracker jack” of a paper the Alestle?
And the radio station is where? And does anyone have any
idea where they're hiding the bathrooms in Alumni Hall?
Well, we can’t help you with the last one, that's one
adventure that would take too long to describe, but here's
the run-down on some of the places you won’t always find
in the directory.
Looking for the clubs? Not the party kind, the serious
kind that expand your mind and look good on resumes. You
need the Kimmel Leadership Center, located on the first
floor o f the University Center
You’re sick! Or you just need a check-up, where’s the
doctor? Health Services is located in the basement of the
Rendleman Building. There are doctors, including
gynocologists, and nurses at your command to help you stay
healthy.
Hated what that pesky editor wrote in the Alestle again,
but you don’t know where to go to complain? She’ll take
your complaints on the second floor of the University
Center.
Want to make a request? SIUE’s own radio station is
located.in the basement of the Communications Building.
Need a good walk and good scenery? Try the Myer
Arboretum, built in honor of the man who helped make the
campus you're studying at a reality. It starts where the bike
trail meets the elusive Alpha House. You can get to it by
getting off at the first road off Cougar Lake Drive. This is
also how you get to the Alpha House, a fraternity house.
A good swim and good workout can all be found on the
first floor o f the Vadalabene Center, which is near the
Alumni and Founders Hall parking'lot.
The Student Experimental Theater is more elusive than
the Alpha House, found just down from the Vadalabene
Center.
Still lost? Try information at ext. 5555 for more help.
Happy hunting.
'

Need your books? The bookstore is located
in the University Center on the first floor.

The Myer Arboretum is located off the
bike trail. The bridge can be seen when
entering C ougar Village. Good for a
walking or biking experience.

The site for many school activities, the
Goshen Lounge is in the center of the
University Center’s first floor.
Looking for free parking? Too bad, it no longer
exists on campus. All good lots are pay-lots.

The oldest and the only: The Alpha House, owned by
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. is the oldest historically
black greek letter organization and is the only Greek
organization with a house on campus. It is just off the bike
trail near the Myer Arboretum entrance.

Bored? Broke? No problem!
Activities for the money challenged
■ BY JIM DALTON
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
If you’re a young college
student, that means one thing;
you have no money. Besides the
spoiled brats who drive their
parents’ Mercedes and get a $500
a week allowance, most of us fall
into the category of monetarily
challenged individuals.
The question that logically
arises from this situation is how
can you have fun without much
money. Well, believe it or not, it
can be done. A lthough Heidi
Feisss may tell you differently,
you don't need a lot of money to
have a good time.

UC
Bowling:
In
the
basement of the University
Center, a 16-lane bowling alley is
open to students. Games cost less
than a $1 and you can rent shoes.
Nothing is cooler or more
attractive than bowling shoes,
with their big stripes of clashing
colors and little numbers on the
back. Anyway, bowling a few
games can be fun and cheap. If
bowling doesn't appeal to you,
check out the billiard tables.
SIUE Plays: The price of
tickets is less than $5. Who
knows? You may be watching the
next Robert De Niro or Emma
Thompson.
Miniature Golf: Mini golf is
cool because anyone can be good
at it. I suck at real golf, but can
compete with anyone on a course
with a windmill or giant metal
alligator.
S h o w p la c e /C o t ton w ood
Theater: The Showplace Theatre
still has that new smell to it and
the floors haven't become sticky.
Twelve large screens are housed
inside
this
very
spacious
multiplex. I once got lost in the
bathroom because it's so huge.
Student tickets only cost $3.50
and refills on popcorn and soda
are free. The stadium seating in
every theater allows short people
to actually view the movie,
without a big jughead blocking
half the screen. A couple blocks
away is the cheaper ($2), smaller,
and lower quality Cottonwood
Theatre.

Night:
Some nights you might not feel
like going out. Chillin' at home
with a friend and a movie makes
for a inexpensive, relaxed
evening..

H ai

SIUE Sporting Event: The
fan support at most of these
sporting events is pathetic. That's
unfortunate because a large
crowd always makes for a good
time. For example, the
Homecoming soccer game
normally draws the fraternities,
sororities and a good sized
crowd. When I look up into the
stands, everybody appears to be
having a great time, and it didn't
cost them a penny. Get yourself
a schedule and go to a couple of
games.
Tons of Fun: This cost-free
event is annually held at the
Student
Fitness
Center.
Activities
include
karaoke,
dancing, Life-Size Sega, a slamdunk
contest,
a
domino
tournament and a bunch of other
cheesy things. If none of that
sounds interesting, at least you
can pick up some free food. They
serve hot dogs, nachos and soda
throughout the night. This year's
festivities run from 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. Oct. 23.
The Zoo: Other cities envy
the St. Louis Zoo's free
admission. I guess because their
citizens have to pay 10 bucks to
see what we can see for free.
The zoo is a good place for large
groups, as well as children.
However, only the admission is
free. Sodas cost $17 apiece.
Fifth
Annual
Rocky
Horror Picture Show: I wonder
if the makers of this cult classic
ever guessed that their little film
would generate such a following.
The film is little more than a
mediocre "B" movie. However,
the fun part is w atching the
audience members, who typically
dress in outrageous outfits, yell at
the characters and use a variety of
props during specified scenes. At
7:30 p.m. Wednesday, the movie
and the party that surrounds it
will be on the Bookstore Patio.
UC Latenighter: The
University Center will put on a
free activity-filled event Friday.
Video karaoke, spin art, a laser
show and a variety of games go
on throughout the night. There
will also be psychic readings,
but I wouldn't put much stock in

what they tell you. Last year, the
woman revealed to me that SIUE
would renovate the Cougar
Village apartments on time,
parking would suddenly become
cheap and convenient and the
Alestle would become a
nationally renowned paper.

Intram ural Sports: The
Fitness Center offers leagues or
tournam ents in nearly every
sport. The entry fees will cost less
than $5 a person. If you played
ball in high school and want to
recapture some old sports glory,
join a league.

Looking for grub?
Here’s a good tip
If you run low on
cash, school events can be a
cheap food source. Often
cam pus
g roups
and
organizations will use free
food to entice you to their
events. By keeping an eye
peeled for the upcom ing free
food you can learn about
clubs as you fill your belly.

the Alestle."
"Hurry up," she said as she
stood behind the desk.
"OK, I'll get right to it. How
does a student go about getting a
job here on campus?"
"It's simple, but morons like
you seem to always mess it up.
First, you go outside the office
here and look at the job board.
Write down the job number and
bring it inside. Then we give you
a referral and you contact your
prospective employer. That's it.
Are we finished?"

LIFESTYLE STRINGR
When I strolled into the
Rendleman Building, I was a
little nervous. I seem to have
problems every time I enter that
building. Whether it's a rude
employee or a mistake with my
records, I have a horrific,
nightmarish experience. As I
entered, my stomach floated up
toward my neck and my heart
began to beat in loud forceful
thum ps.
The
rhythm ical,
pulsating heartbeats seemed to
rem ind me of a ticking time
bom b.
Sw allow ing hard and
taking a deep breath, I climbed
the stairs.
This was my first interview
for the Alestle, and although it
would probably be a cinch, I
didn't want to mess it up. I
certainly
didn't
w ant
the
building's extreme dislike for me
to
resurface
into
another
embarrassing disaster. At the top
of the steps, I straightened my tie
and went into the Student
Employment office. I told the
student worker that I write for the
Alestle and would like to talk to
som eone
about
student
employment. Through his wirerimmed glasses, he squinted at
me and said everyone was at
lunch, but would be back in a few
minutes. My spectacled guide
then led me to an office where he
said I could wait.
The office was dimly lit,
most of it in shadows. A small
window permitted a tiny beam of

insulting tone and manner would
have been inexcusable, but here it
almost seemed to fit. "Just a few
more questions, ma'am. Uhmm
... what kind of jobs are available
and what are the hourly wages?"
"All types of jobs are
available. There are plenty of
jobs
in food service, in
m aintenance, working in the
library, in the Fitness Center,
working as a tutor, and helping
out in the various departments
and offices. Students should just
see what job appeals to them.
Most of the jobs start at $5.15 an
hour, but some pay a little more.
For every 500 hours you work,
your wage increases by a dime."
"The Alestle is also hiring," I
informed her.
"What kind of loser would
want to work for that rag?fl
"Excuse me, miss, I write for
the Alestle."
"My point exactly."
The room was sweltering
and the dark paint on the walls
looked as if it were melting. The
woman's blatant disrespect and
the Death Valley temperature
caused the sweat to pour from my
body, but I would not leave; I still
had questions.
"Anyway, I only have two
more questions. What about offcampus jobs?"
"There's a list of off-campus
jobs on the board outside this
office along with a description
and information about who to
contact. Now, get the hell out of
here."
"If you don't mind, I only
have one more question. I was

wondering ..."
"Get out!" roared the devil
woman.
As she screamed, the walls
began to shake and the floor split
and bubbled up. Under the floor,
I could see dark red flames
spewing from a black abyss. I
knew the origin of those flames,
but I was determined to ask my
last question. The tremors, which
began to shake the office
increasingly more violently, had
thrown me from my chair. From
the crumbling ground, I yelled
out, "How many hours are
students allowed to work each
week?"
The woman offered no
response, instead she flew at me
with her claw-like hands slicing
toward my neck. The tips of her
jagged nails punctured my soft
flesh before I grabbed her wrists.
Her red eyes were now right on
top of me and her molten breath
began to bum my face. The
beastly woman really didn't
appear to be human, she was too
mutated and too strong, definitely
too strong. I could barely keep
her hands from slashing my
throat, but I was still determined
to have her answer that last
question. "How many hours can a
student work each week?"
The woman roared again, but
did not answer. The walls had
begun to crumble rapidly and
gaping holes ate through the
floor.
The entire room was
shaking or spinning, I couldn't
exactly tell. I knew that the room
would be descending to hell in a
few seconds. Her strength began

to lessen, and I seized my
opportunity and pushed her
toward one of the ever-growing
holes in the floor. Quickly I ran
outside the office, as the floor
completely collapsed.
Standing just beyond office,
I saw the woman hovering,
entrenched in a wall of flames.
Staring into those red eyes, I
yelled as loud as I could, "How
many hours can students work
per week?!"
The wall of flames grew, but
the woman wasn't burning. She
sighed and said, "Students can
work 20 hours a week, except
during the summer semester and
on break weeks, then they can
work 30 hours."
I don't
remember exactly what happened
next, but the next thing I recall is
running away across the quad. I
haven't been near the Rendelman
Building since.
♦Author's Note: The content of
this article is entirely true. I did
not fabricate, exaggerate, or
em bellish one detail of this
occurrence.
I give you my
solemn word as a reporter for the
Alestle that the entire account did
happen exactly as it was
described. Although I've been
told
I
have
problems
distinguishing
reality
from
fantasy, I assure you that such
accusations
are
entirely
unfounded.
If nothing else, I
hope this shows how far I am
w illing to go to provide my
fellow students with accurate
information.

Fighting the “freshman fifteen”

A u g u s t 25, 1998 ♦

‘ NEON - Small Size Cruise, Tilt

From potential “frat b o y s” to “fat b o y s”
■ BY JIM DALTON
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
"The Freshman Fifteen.”
That's the term for the 15 or so
pounds that many college
students gain once they get to
college. Too much beer, food, and
not enough exercise can quickly
make your favorite jeans seem
like they shrunk. Before you call
Jenny Craig, swing by the
Student Fitness Center.
The
facility is simply state o f the art.
There
are
equipm ent and
activities
to
accom m odate
anyone's fitness or athletic needs.
The weight room is stocked
with plenty of free weights and ,
Badger and Lifecircuit exercise
machines. A new addition to the
weight room is being built this
semester and it will contain the
top-of-the-line Hammer Strength
equipment. If weight lifting is not
your thing, there are plenty of
bikes, treadm ills, stairm asters,
and
other
cardiovascular
equipment. Best o f all, every
aerobic machine is equipped with
Cardio Theater, so you can watch
TV. or listen to the radio while
you bum off those calories.
Above the weight room is an
indoor eighth-mile track for all
you runners out there. If you
prefer an organized aerobics
class, there are a variety of
classes throughout the day. For
those of you that like a challenge,

W

e

l c

try Tina Kassa's class at 4:45 p.m.
Monday through Thursday. The
Fitness Center also has an indoor
pool with times for lap and
recreational swimming.
Because everybody isn't a
fitness expert, the Fitness Center
has plenty of programs and staff
to help you start your workout
routine.The
weightroom
is
always staffed with individuals
ready to answer your questions or
help you with a machine. You can
also hire a personal trainer to
supervise and organize your
workouts.
In the sports department, the
Fitness Center has a lot to offer.
Three full-length basketball
courts and one hockey/soccer
court are available for open play
throughout the day. You can also
sign up for a racquetball court or
the ping pong table. If you want
some com petition, leagues in
every sport im aginable are
available. (My personal favorite
has got to be the Whiffleball
World Series).
As you can see, the Fitness
Center has som ething for
everyone. And let me tell you
something, SIUE takes a student
fitness center fee from you every
semester, regardless o f whether
or not you set foot in the place.
You might as well take advantage
of this fine facility.

It was the dream o f the founders o f
SIUE to have a campus encased in the
natural beauty o f the forest and gently
rolling hills surrounding it. Even now the
names o f some o f our buildings reflect that
commitment to nature that SIUE has made
with its Woodland and Prairie halls.
Filled with bike trails and wildlife, there
are acres to cross and explore on our
campus. The sometimes rustic settings offer
many different plants and trees to study and
plenty o f wildlife to observe within our own

satisfaction. Take the time to admire the

Not your mother’s “hick town”

Won’t you take me
to the party town?
And you thought there was nothing to do in this
town. Jim Dalton would like to prove otherwise.
■ BY JIM DALTON
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
As I drove into SIUE for the
first time, I started to get a little
worried. Passing all the com
fields, bams and small buildings,
I thought I was arriving in some
boring hick town. As visions of
college students tipping cows
flashed through my head,
I
fretted that I'd spend all my time
in my room studying, because it
was the best thing to do.
Fortunately, I realized that
Edwardsville wasn't the Hee haw
nightmare I thought it was.
In fact, the Edw ardsville
area has plenty of things to
entertain our young minds and
bodies.
Top Five Places to Eat
1) Shenanigans: This place has an
interesting, eclectic atmosphere
with a unique college/sports
bar/restaurant/museum flavor to
it. It caters to the college crowd
with college nights and SIUE
student discounts. A good place
to have a drink with friends, take
a date to dinner or simply stare at
all the junk on the walls.
2) Imo’s Pizza: The home of the
famous Saint Louis style pizza on
a cracker. In addition to this
wafer pizza, Im o’s m akes a
number of other Italian dishes. I
recommend the toasted ravioli
which I have been known to eat
by the dozen. (Last year, I set the
Guiness world record by eating
123 Imo’s toasted ravioli in two
hours).
3) Pizza World: Although it lacks
the novelty effect of an Im o’s, it
more than makes up for it with
excellent pizza. This place is
simply good, possibly the best
tasting pizza I've ever had.
However, it's "gourmet" pizza so
the price is a little higher. A word
to the wise, pick up your pizza if
at all possible
Their delivery
service is slow. The pizzas I
ordered for Super Bowl just
arrived yesterday.

4) Cancún: This place is as fast as
Pizza World is slow. You sit
down and immediately chips and
salsa are served. Thirty seconds
later, someone takes your order
and you're eating your meal
inside three minutes. The menu
consists of a variety of Mexican
dishes that are delicious and
reasonably priced. If you like
Mexican, check it out.
5) Redz Rib Shack: To barbecue
lovers, this place is paradise.
Where else can you buy a whole
chicken platter special?
It's
perfect for those days when you
feel like barbecue, but are too
lazy to make it yourself.
Honorable Mention
A & W: With food that's
better than the average fast food
joint and the original root beer
float, it's like Dairy Queen, only
better.
Best Local Sporting Events
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)

SIUE basketball game
SIUE soccer game
SIUE baseball game
SIUE track and field
SIUE wrestling match
Do you detect a common
theme yet? Hey, admission is free
with your student ID, so you can't
say it's too expensive. The games
are here on campus, so you don't
have to drive out o f your way.
Believe it or not, readers, these
athletes are talented and they
deserve your support. Last year,
SIUE won the overall sports
trophy for the conference. The
baseball and soccer teams were
ranked in the national top ten.
Also, SIUE has the best Division
II tennis player, Mike Reither.
So go out and catch some of
these games. If nothing else, it
would make me feel better. I feel
kind of stupid running around
yelling and beating my bare redpainted chest when there are only
three people at a volleyball game.

Two years ago the S IU E w o m en ’s soccer program w ent 16-4-1
and received a bid to the N C A A T ournam ent.
Last year the C ougars fell to 16-7.
“It seem ed th a t w e d id n ’t adjust defensively,” head coach
Brian K orbesm eyer said. “We lost a lot of close ones. It was like
a shooting gallery o u t th ere. W ho ever shot last, w on.”
A fter th e e n d o f last season th e C ougars felt the year
shouldn’t have e n d ed so soon.
“We had a bad taste
in
o
u
r
m ouths. We felt like
Men’s Soccer preview
we d id n ’t fulfill w h at we
in Thursday’s Alesile
w an ted
to
accom plish,”
K orbesm eyer said.
This season’s first o rd e r o f business is for the team m em bers
to b etter them selves defensively and then, K orbesm eyer said, he
believes everything will fall in to place.
W ith som e n ew recruits an d players rising to fill voids left by
graduation, K orbesm eyer said he sees the team getting back in
contention for an N C A A bid.
“W ith th e se n ew a d d itio n s we sh o u ld be able to
propel ourselves back to w h ere we w ere tw o years ago,"
K orbesm eyer said.
The C ougars will have back Janece Friederich, S IU E ’s all-tim e
leading scorer, to help them in the 1998 cam paign, which begins
with an ex hibition m atch -u p with St. Louis U niversity on
W ednesday night in St. Louis.
Their final exhibition gam e will be against M issouri B aptist at
6 p.m. Friday at SIU E .

T here is nothing surprising a b o u t th e new w om en’s golf
p rogram at SIU E.
“We m ight be w here we w ant to be,” head coach Larry
B en nett said of his outlook on the inaugural season.
Like every new sport th at com es on cam pus, it is hard to know
w hat you have before you play the game.
V olleyball was introduced as a varsity sport at S IU E a few
years ago and head coach Sandy M ontgom ery said roughly the
sam e thing.
M ontgom ery felt she had som e quality players but until she
saw them in gam e situations, she d id n ’t know w hat she had.
The unique aspect to B en nett is th a t he will be coaching for
the first time.
"S tarting a new program is a learning experience,” B en nett
said. "R ight now I am learning all I can ab ou t N C A A guidelines,
recruiting principles, the conference, th e adm inistrative side, like
setting u p schedules and housing while on the ro ad .”
B en n ett has been with C am pus R ecreatio n at S IU E for 10
y ears a n d w hen A ssistan t A th le tic D ire c to r Nick A d am s
inform ed him of the new coaching p osition B en n ett ju m p ed at
the chance.
The new season of w om en’s golf will have two transfers and
th ree freshm en.
“W e have som e girls who can really play,” B en nett said. “We
w ant to be com petitive as soon as possible. I’m com petitive
m yself and I think I recruited the sam e kind o f player.”
T he m ain objective for th e year is to be as com petitive as they
can, as quickly as they can, B e n n e tt said.
“I guess you could say we are cautiously optimistic. We d o n ’t
w ant to go into this too optim istic because this is o u r first year b ut
th e n again given the com petitive n a tu re o f th e players, we will be
u pset if we a re n ’t com petitive this year,” B e n n e tt said.
The players will be working ou t on the Spencer T. O lin G olf
C ourse in A lton.

INTRODUCTION

,

Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) is dedicated to the traditional academic pursuits of
instruction, scholarship and public service. The University assigns first priority to excellence in education. Further,
the University values a humane, safe, and supportive environment to aid students in their pursuit of knowledge
Therefore, the President, under the authority of the Board of Trustees, has approved a code of behavior to govern

Student Conduct Code may be amended periodically. Responsibility for the enforcement of regulations associated
with the Student Conduct Code rests with the Chancellor or the Chancellor s designee. Immediate responsibility rests
with the Vice Chancellor fo r Student Affairs or designee. The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs may develop
policies and procedures for the administration of the Student Conduct Code which are consistent with the provision
of this Code.

pursuits of its students, faculty, or staff.
4.

IN THE NEW FILM " S lU r S HOLLYWOOD SCREEN KISS,"'
WRITER/DIRECTOR TOMMY O'HAVER DEMONSTRATES HIS
LOVE FOR ROMANCE, FRIENDSHIP AND DRAG QUEENS
■ BY COREY STULCE

Welcome back, I guess. For
those of you who have never
read my stuff before, I hope you
enjoy. For those who have, what
the hell is wrong with you?
Anyway, it’s back to the
grind. And I figure I’ve been
around this campus long enough
to share a couple of tips for
newcomers, or short-attention
span old-comers. So pay
attention; this stuff is gold!
For those of you who haven’t
picked up your books yet, good
for you! Wait until next week.
There’s nothing worse than
that stiflingly hot, cattle drive
into the book room. Any
professor who gives reading
assignments the first week needs
to be boycotted.
By now, everyone should
know that parking is a bitch.
Don’t worry, it’ll get worse as
the year progresses. Just wait
until they decide to close the
main road into campus for a
week. That’ll be a hoot.
So you get to campus late.
Pull into the meter lot behind the
Rendleman Building. There’s
always a broken meter there that
requires no pocket change. (Save
the change to throw at
construction workers. They love
it.) But keep an eye on your
magic meter. If it is fixed during
the day, you will get a ticket.
Now, skipping class. This is
tricky. By now, your prof has
heard every “dead granny” and
“I was diagnosed with
impromptu pelvic spasm” story
out there. But for some reason,
the old “car trouble” story still
seems to work, if you call ahead
of time and leave a message. Just
don’t abuse it.
OK, so these were freebies. I
have plenty more, but they will
cost you a quarter apiece. The
line forms at the rear.

If romance is dead, the new comedy,
"B illy’s Hollywood Screen Kiss,” will
attempt to revive it, while providing a funny,
visually striking experience. TThe film
involves one man’s infatuation for another
man, but deals with themes for everyone, be it
gay, straight, bi-sexual or even Mormon.
Who hasn’t had to ask the question, “God,
I really like/lust/love that person, but how
does he/she feel about me?” Of course Billy
(Sean P. Hayes), has it even rougher; he is
trying to decipher if the object of his affection
is gay or not.
The debut feature from writer/director
Tommy O ’Haver is full of technicolor magic,
harking back to the old MGM musicals of the
’40s. The story follows Billy, a photographer,
who uses his decades-old Polaroid camera to
bring to life the great movie kisses. His
models are drag queens and of course, his
hoped-for paramour, Gabriel.
Billy and Gabriel become friends, all the
while Billy’s tension is heightened as he
attempts to find out Gabriel’s true nature.
O ’Haver has filled the rest of the film with
wild, eclectic characters, including gaggles of
drag queens, all of whom add to the movie’s
hysterical nature.
All in all, it’s a movie about friendship and
learning that if you wait long enough,
romance will find you. O ’Haver sends the
message that, though the seas are sometimes
turbulent, love will eventually come to all.
The movie that was a smash at the Sundance
Film Festival is now playing at the Tivoli
theater in the U City Loop.
O ’Haver is currently working on a bigscreen adaptation of the “Archie” comic for
Universal Pictures. But he took a few minutes
away from preproduction to answer a few
questions about his own coming out and
writing about real life and romance.
Have you gotten a chance to see “Billy”
in an actual theater with an audience yet?
I’ve gone and seen the end a couple times.
People were applauding and it was really nice
to see.
When did your inclinations towards film
-making begin?
Pretty young. I did a lot of Super 8, stop
motion movies. “G.I. Joe Meets Barbie,” and
“Monsterslayer,” all done with "Star Wars”
figures, which was supposed to be a sequel to
“Dragonslayer.” I couldn’t get the characters
to talk, because it was Super 8.
That was as a kid. When I got into high
school and college, I was reviewing movies
for the paper and I got into theater. I was
taking writing classes at Indiana University

on the side-. You couldn’t get a film
major there, there was no production
class. I had a writing teacher who
thought’ I could make a living at it if I
just wrote, so I took that as a sign and
moved to L.A., and I worked as a
production assistant. Then I went to the
mail room. I wrote a short film that a
friend of mine directed, which was
bought by Showtime, and that was
where I finally got people to talk [in a
movie].
1 read that you did a short film
about coming out. Were you out when
you made it?

There must be some reason the
“Rocky Horror Picture Show”
keeps getting played in movie
theaters around the world. Maybe
it’s because the rules are, there
are no rules. Audience members
are encouraged, nay expected, to
yell at the screen, act out, dance,
sing and throw various objects at
each other.
It’s like a tamer version of
anarchy, with catchy tunes. But I
think the real reason young
people all over the world keep
revisiting thè 1975 film has
something to do with one of the
film ’s major themes: sex.
“Rocky” has a little something
for every taste: there’s a nice
married couple (Brad and Janet),
a feisty transvestite (Dr. Frank-NFurter), incestuous, costum ed
siblings (Riff Raff and Magenta),
an obsessive tart (Columbia), a
brain-dead hunk (Rocky) and
Meat Loaf.
Plot exam ination is not
important. But the themes, now
those are worth paying attention
to. Exploration can be a good
thing. Love conquers all. And
don’t screw with an alien and
his sister unless you want to
be shot with a three pronged
phailic-pistol.
Unfortunately, “Rocky” has
not been screened in the St. Louis
area for some time now. That’s
a shame. It really is one movie
that should be seen on the big
screen with obsessive club kids
performing in front of the screen.
I remember my first time. Ah,
back when I was a virgin. I was a
petrified naive teen, a sophomore
in high school, not even old
enough to drive myself to the
theater. Back then it was still
shown at the old Tivoli theater on
Delmar, years before its spiffy
redesign. The Tiv was still a cool
movie house, just a lot dingier,
with a better chance to get some
asbestos poisoning.
Anyway, I had no idea what to
expect. People were screaming
indecipherable things. There

were men wearing (gasp!)
lingerie. W hat the hell had I
gotten myself into? And this was
before those giant lips ever hit the
screen!
Suffice to say, it was an
enlightening experience. And I
went many, many, many more
times throughout high school and
eventually picked up on all the
fun sayings (even made up a few
of my own).
I think one of the great things
about the film experience is
that no one is shunned. That’s
probably why it’s embraced by so
many gay and lesbian teens
(besides the sexual over- and
undertones).
Now sitting in front of the
University Center is not quite the
same as in a dark, run-down
theater, but it’s the best w e’ve got
right now.
Besides, it’ll be fun to watch
wide-eye small-towners try to
comprehend what they are seeing
on the big screen.
Remember, it’s just a jump to
the left...

Snipes flick “Blade” has lots
of bite and buckets of blood
NEW YORK (AP) — In the
mood for a little gore? How about
a nice decapitation to finish off
the summer? Or maybe some
impromptu dentistry?
Be forewarned: while “Blade”
is a stylish, original twist on the
comic-book action movie, it’s
also harrowingly graphic.
The film opens at an
underground vampire nightclub
beneath
the
floor
of
a
slaughterhouse. As
dancers
gyrate, blood sprays from the
ceiling.
Enter Blade, played by Wesley
Snipes, a sword-wielding mutant
who hunts vampires in hopes of
keeping them from taking over
the world.
The film deftly sidesteps
cliches and delivers a complex
plot that’s quickly moved along
with more intelligent dialogue
than is typical for this genre.
These vampires deal in things

like politics and offshore
accounts; one of them is bored,
unshaven pretty boy Deacon
Frost (Stephen Dorff) w ho’s
threatening the world with
apocalypse.
Blade, who looks like a cross
between Robocop and Tim
Burton’s version of Batman,
fights vampires because he is
angry that one of them chomped
on his mother when she was
pregnant, causing her to die as he
was bom. The bite also altered
his genetic makeup, turning him
into a half-human, half-vampire
who can withstand traditional
vampire weapons like garlic and
daylight but still thirsts for blood.
Joining him in his fight are the
requisite codger sidekick (in this
case, Kris Kristofferson playing a
vengeful, cancer-stricken old
man whose family was wiped out
by vampires) and a young
hematologist (N’bushe Wright)

by screenwriter David S. Goyer
as “Shaft with a stake.”

somehow makes the scenes even

who works to find a cure for
vampire blood after she is bitten
by an undead corpse in a
hospital.
There’s plenty of action to
go around, especially in fight
sequences where Snipes gets to
show off his real-life martial arts
prowess. But this action is
smartly paired with a storyline
that has Oedipal and Christian
overtones.
When Blade is finally reunited
with his mother, who has become
a vampire, she acts seductively
toward him. And when his
hands and feet are impaled in a
climactic torture scene. His blood
is drained into a chalice.
The film is based on a Marvel

going to use it, they have to be
more discreet.
The ending of “Blade” clearly
leaves room for a sequel. With
any luck, Snipes and the
filmmakers will avoid the diluted
formula that has plagued the
“Batman” series.
“Blade,” a New Line Cinema
release, was produced by Amen

Imaginary Forces. It was directed
by Stephen Norrington, produced
by Peter Frankfurt. Wesley
Snipes and Robert Engelman and
written by David S. Goyer.

Lennon murderer doesn’t want album back
ATTICA, New York (AP) — The
deranged fan who killed John
Lennon doesn’t want a cent
for the album he got Lennon
to autograph shortly before
the murder.
The former Beatle signed and
dated his “Double Fantasy”
album for Mark David Chapman
outside his apartment building
the same day he was killed,
Dec. 8, 1980.
The record is being offered

Chapman,
43,
said
he
stashed the album behind a
watchman’s booth and fired five
shots from a .38-caliber revolver
into Lennon’s back as the rock
star returned home from a
recording session.
After being examined by
police as evidence, the album
was returned to the man who
found it.

the crime scene.
Chapman, who is serving a
20-years-to-life prison sentence,
said he was contacted last week

told Chapman he had the legal

album as a personal possession.

Stooge lovers convention held
BURBANK, Calif. (AP) — It’s a
gathering where people enjoy
getting a slap instead of a
handshake, pay extra to get a pie
in the face and soak up 75 years
of Three Stooges nostalgia.
The
first
West
Coast
convention of Stooge lovers was
held this month at the Burbank
Airport
Hilton
Hotel
and
Convention Center. Previous
gatherings were in Philadelphia,
home of Stooge Larry Fine, who
died in 1974.
The widow o f a later Stooge,
Curly Joe DeRita, was among the
participants at the affair.
“We’re trying to keep the
Stooges alive,” Jean DeRita said
during a break from signing
books and posters with her late
husband’s likeness.
Formed as a vaudeville act in
1923, the Stooges made about
200 film com edy shorts and
appeared in a dozen feature films
between
1930
and
1965.
Pounding each other’s heads with
mallets, tw eaking noses and
kicking shins were staples of
their movies, which reached a
new generation when shown on
television.
At the convention, Stooge-ophiles like Leo Wolene, 52, of
Northridge
were
able
to
experience something of what it
was like before the cam eras
decades ago.

Wolene took part in a replay of
a famous Stooges scene: Madame
Pompadour’s birthday, a fancy
affair that degenerated into piethrowing.
For $50, any knucklehead
could throw a few shaving-cream
pies and take home a videotape
keepsake of the performance.
“Lucky” Giorgianni, 70, of
Valencia said he remembers
racing to the movie house in New
Brunswick, N.J., to see the latest
Stooges shorts.
Besides
comedy
the
convention also had a mystery. A
$5,000 reward was offered for
information leading to the arrest
of crooks who allegedly stole 120
cases of freshly brewed “Three
Stooges” beer being trucked from
Atlanta to Burbank.
“What is this world coming
to?” said Bob Benjamin, son of
Jean DeRita and stepson of Curly
Joe. He helped found Comedy III
Productions Inc. to promote the
Stooges’ legacy and control their
trademarks.
The beer was intended for a
reception for the most ardent
followers of the Stooges, who
dubbed
themselves
“Very
Important Knuckleheads.” An
emergency shipment of 10 cases
was flown in to quench their
thirst, said Patrick Lauerman,
who handles merchandising for
Comedy III Productions.
