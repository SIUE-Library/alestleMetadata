Parking Fees to
go different route

University implements sexual
harassment policy and procedures
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor

By Melanie Adams
Editor in chief
The battle over parking sticker fees is finally over. President
of Southern Illinois University Ted Sanders and C hancellor of
Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville Nancy Belck have
approved the proposed increase for parking fees introduced to
them earlier this year.
The proposal that the President and C hancellor approved
for the increase was a modified three year plan instead of the
five year plan recom m ended by the faculty and student
senates in April.
“A fter m eeting with President Sanders and reviewing the
financing for a five year pay-out plan, there were cash flow
problem s in years two and three,” Belck said in a university
bulletin update. “We both agree that a three-year increase
plan solves the cash flow concerns and addresses the
constituencies’ desire to lower the rate increases the first two
years.”
The parking sticker increase, when first proposed, consisted
of a two year period that would have raised the parking sticker
price as much as an additional $35 this coming fall.
With the approved three year pay-out plan, the sticker fee
will increase only $20 this coming fall and an additional $20
the second year with an additional $15 in the third year of the
plan, Ken Neher, vice chancellor for adm inistration, said.
“The first year fee increase is definite but after the first year
there is still the chance of varying price within the plan
depending on the construction bids and the am ount of interest
that the revenue bonds acquire,” N eher said.
Bob Vanzo, director of adm inistration services, said in
earlier interviews that the parking sticker fee increase was
proposed in order to cover the $8.2 million parking and
infrastructure project approved by the B O T on A pril 11.
In order to pay for the project, the university borrow ed the
money and is paying it back through the sticker fee increases
and the sale of revenue bonds, N eher said.
The project, which will cover lot renovations, lighting
enhancem ents and road resurfacing, is scheduled to begin

The university is taking a
stand against sexual
harassment.
University legal counsel
Kim Kirn said a new policy,
effective A pril 9, is about
three times as long as the
former one and gets very
specific at times as to what is
and is not acceptable
behavior.
“We’ve clarified that
consensual sexual relations
between teachers and current
students are prohibited. It was
not as clear under the old
policy; now it’s crystal clear,”
she said.
’
*
Kirn said the fact that there
is a new policy has nothing to
do with any sexual harassment
charges currently levied
against the university. “The
new policy won’t affect

anything before April 9,” she
said.
The policy provides for a
sexual harassment committee
made up of 12 individuals who
are nom inated by the director
of H um an Relations. The
director receives the names
from the president of the
student body, staff senate and
faculty sepate, in addition to
the four vice-chancellors.
The names of panel
members were not available
by press time and it was
unclear if students would be
eligible for nomination.
A nother change will be
advisors for each building on
campus who will attem pt to
help resolve sexual
harassment problems before
they reach a point where legal
action might have to be taken.
Any unresolved problems will
then be referred to the
H um an Relations office.
The H um an Relations
office will conduct an

investigation and a report will
be made to a rotating
committee from the panel of
twelve.
“Sanctions can be as light
as a verbal reprimand,
including a reference for
counseling, suspension from
work or school and up to
termination. And there have
been term inations in the past.
It also allows for an apology,
which 1 think is very
appropriate,” Kirn said.
The person filing a
complaint will always have the
option of going directly to the
H um an Relations office, Kirn
said.
Training the advisors
began about three weeks ago,
she said. Kirn and John
Gilbert, general council for
the university, will be
conducting the training
sessions which last about three
hours.

Vice Chancellors to attend
June 7 student senate meeting

News Editor
Two S1UE adm inistrators
will field questions from
students at the student
senate m eeting Friday. Vice
Chancellor of Student
Affairs N arbeth Em m anuel
and Vice C hancellor of
Adm inistration K enneth
N eher will discuss, among
other topics, the new MCT

Last week, N eher m eet
with Student Body president
C hristopher Nance, Vice
President Jam es Little and
student senator A ntonio
Stephens to discuss some of
the concerns students have

about MCT.
Little com m ented on
some of the discussion that
took place.
“He, (N eher), said one of
the reasons the university
didn’t involve students in the
negotiations was because it
was a business proposition.
H e said you d o n ’t bring
students into business when
it is in the proposal stage.
The university loses its
leverage in bargaining,”
Little said.
Little does see some
problem s with the
university’s method.

by the time the contract is
signed, it’s too late,” Little
said. “W hat we have to keep
stressing here is
communications. W hen the
university keeps pulling stuff
like this, there is some type
of a communications gap.”
The m eeting will be held
in the G oshen Lounge,

approval by the Food and Drug Administration on Monday.
Epitope Inc. Orasue uses a treated cotton pad to scrape a
tissue sample from between the gum and cheek. The sample is tested
for antibodies to the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
The first generation of Orasure received approval in 1994, but
it used a less sensitive method to screen for HIV antibodies, called
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA.

Tokyo - A Japanese team that scaled Mount Everest denied Monday
that they refused to help Indian climbers who died on the slopes
during a fatal blizzard last month.
Team leader Katsutoshi Ikebe called the allegations „
“groundless,” in a news conference in Fukuoka, 560 miles southwest
of Tokyo.
Ikebe said his team had offered “as much help as possible” to
the Indian mountaineers. An earlier release said they sent a Sherpa

the hospital emergency room.
The lawsuit, filed by O ’Fallon attorney Anthony R.

University makes good on leaving students out in the dark

of View

STUDEMT GOVT.

ryl Howlett
Long live the queen! This exclam ation is often
announced joyfully by residents of the British Isles.
To them, the queen represents tradition, honor and a
link to E ngland’s glorious past. However, take a
closer look at the queen and you will find som eone
who has absolutely no political pow er beneath that
crown. This is the basis of a constitutional monarchy.
H ow ever, ju st because a country is a
constitutional m onarchy does not m ean it cannot
have some type of power. In fact, during the mid1970s, when Spain was m aking a transition from
dictatorship to a constitutional m onarchy, som e
rebels tried to overthrow the governm ent. Not so
fast, though. King Juan Carlos, seeing a potentially
threatening attem pt toward democracy, went on
television and told his people not to bow in to the
coup. N ot only did the people respond in favor of the
king, the coup was defeated. Now th a t’s pow er for a
figure who m akes no decisions for the country.
In recent years, the university has treated student
government like that of a constitutional monarchy.
The university holds all the pow er while those who
support and defend the rights o f students are
presented as just “figure” leaders. Som eone to listen
to the problem s of students, but not always capable
of doing anything against adm inistrators.
In July of 1993, the T SA -IE A (Technical Staff
Association- Illinois E ducation Association) accused
the university of unfair labor practices as it tried
contracting out student health services and Tower
L ake bus service (interesting). The university
response was th at its co n tract w ith the union
specified that it could request for bid services as long
as a certain am ount of time was given to the union.
The infam ous Coca-Cola/Pepsi Cola incident in
the sum m er and fall of 1994 dem onstrated how the
university w ent over the heads o f student
government and students to land a controversial
deal. And now, the university again has seem ed to
pull the wool over the eyes of both students and
student government.
In the case of Coca-Cola, an eight year contract
was signed w ithout any input from student
government o r students. O ne day out of the clear
blue, Pepsi m achines and their products where being
moved off of the campus. All of the changes were
done in the best interest of the university. According
to the university, Coca-Cola “offered a superior
commission rate on canned and bottle beverages as
well as superior prices per gallon of mixed beverage
fountains.”
O ne clever solution which the university took was
to contract services from Taco Bell and Pizza Hut
(tw o Pepsi com panies). W ith this m ove the
university possibly saved itself from legal action
from Pepsi. However, that move did not save SIU E
from the backlash and outrage from SIU E students.
A nother point to m ake is the university timing
when these contracts are made. It’s been pointed out
by a form er student body president that when deals
are made, it’s usually during a transitional period.
D uring breaks betw een spring and sum m er or
sum m er and fall, the university seem s to take
advantage of the sm aller percentage of students to

Faculty member attends nation’s
first Children’s Day March
Teaches students to be children advocates
By Danettc Watt
Assistant News Editor

M arian Wright Edelm an stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial
and directed a crowd of about 200,000 A m ericans to “leave no child
behind.” Edelm an, head of the C hildren’s D efense Fund, was the driving
force that led to the nation’s first Stand for C hildren Day on June 1.
Edelm an said that A m ericans needed to m ake children and their
rights “our first priority, regardless of race, creed, gender, religion or
political affiliation.”
“Everyday, 15 children are killed by gunfire; over 8,000 are abused or
neglected; 100,000 are hom eless and 1 in 10— 6.3 million) live in family’s
whose income is less than half the official poverty level,” she said.
Children can’t speak, vote or lobby for themselves, she said, so adults
must do it for them.
Eileen Borgia, assistant professor in the departm ent of curriculum
and instruction, attended the rally with a group from U rbana. A long­
time advocate of children, Borgia has in the past spoken to the state
legislators.
Borgia said one of the most im portant things people can do to help
children is to keep on top of the issues and to vote.
“G oing to the rally was one way of showing my support,” she said. “I
also teach my students about their obligation to be a children’s
advocate.”
Children living in poverty, she said, face many obstacles in their
school years, including poor concentration due to hunger.
W hile 10,000 children were marching across a bridge to the Lincoln
M em orial, about 300 people stopped by the C enter for Racial Harm ony
in the Schnucks Swansea Plaza in Belleville.
Racial H arm ony opened up about five years ago, according to Loretta
Fredrich, assistant director at S IU E ’s Early Childcare Center. The center
is the result of a story on 60 M inutes about how Belleville police were
harassing black motorists. A group of citizen’s wanted to change
Belleville’s negative image.
Fredrich, who is on the board of directors, said she and Constant
R ockingham , president of Racial Harm ony, heard about Stand for
Children in m id-April and thought it the ideal opportunity to show their
support and com m itm ent to area children.
“A bout eleven agencies were there, such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters
of Southern Illinois, the U rban League and Call for H elp,” Fredrich
said. “Each agency had a chance to hand out inform ation and give a talk
to let people know how that agency could help them .”
Edelm an and others want to continue the spirit of Stand for Children
Day and they said there are things “the average, busy person” can do.
Som ething as simple as feeding a hungry neighborhood child can m ake a
difference, they said.
A nd, often, it’s from small actions that big changes are made.

In the past students have taken advantage of the cool waters of Tower Lake pool to
keep cool during the summer. Specials being held this summer include "Family
Night' on Mondays and 'Student Night" on Thursday nights.

Tower Lake pool offers a
variety of events to keep
you cool this summer
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor

If you head out to the pool this
summer, you w on’t notice all of the
changes that have been m ade over the
year, but you’ll probably be surprised at
some of them.
A bout 20 people showed up
M emorial Day for the first day of the
swim season at Tower Lake Pool.
John Bell said the turn-out was
“pretty good, considering the (cooler)
w eather.” Bell is assistant coordinator
of campus recreation.
The pool, built in 1987, received
general m aintenance and repairs over
the year. Pipes leading to the pool,
return lines and filters were replaced
and repaired. In addition, the diving
board was removed.
Bell said the removal of the diving
board gave lifeguards a better overall
view of swimmers.
Many guests were surprised last year
to learn rafts and inner tubes were no
longer allowed in the pool. Bell said the
new rule was m ade for safety reasons.
“A child becomes too dependent on
a personal flotation device, such as the
‘no«dle.’ If it slips out from beneath
them , kids panic,” he said. “T he only
personal flotation devices allowed for
kids will be those attached to the body,
such as w ater wings. Rafts will be

allowed only during adult swim. In
o th er words, only the adults will be able
to have them and only during those ten
m inutes.”
A dult swim is just one of the new
program s being initiated this year. On
really busy days, there will be a 10m inute “adult swim” starting at ten
m inutes before the hour.
“This will be a chance for the adults
to relax a bit without the kids in the
pool,” he said. It also gives kids a
chance to get out of the pool for a short
rest.
“Family night” will be on Monday
nights from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Students,
faculty and alumni will be allowed to
bring their im m ediate family members
to the pool free of charge, even if they
do not have a pool pass.
Thursday nights will be “Student
night.” Students only will be allowed to
swim from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Bell hopes
to have a few barbeques and to make
the pool a place for students to m eet
before they go out for the evening.
The pool is open daily from 11:30
a.m. until 6 p.m. Prices for a pool pass
range from free for enrolled students to
$46 for alumni who are not members of
the alumni association. Those alumni
family m em bers would pay $20 each
and for enrolled students’ children pay
$5 or $12, depending on their age.

"Twister" storms box office, but dies out in way of plot
By Melanie Adams
Editor in Chief
Twister (tw ist’er) n. 1. a tornado or cyclone 2. a
m ediocre plot with stupendous special effects
ranking second in box office sales.
I got th e chance to see “T w ister” this past
weekend, and 1 must say, I was a little disappointed
with the plot. This Steven Spielberg film starring Bill
Paxton and H elen H unt, in a nut shell, is about a
group of people who try to chase down tornadoes
with their experim ental m easuring machines and try
to patch up a m arriage at the same time.
The film begins with a scene from Jo’s, played by
H elen Hunt, childhood. The scene shows Jo, her aunt
and h er fath er huddled in the cellar, hiding
themselves from the “fender of G od,” the strongest
type of tornado ever to touch down in Kansas. Jo’s
father is pulled from the cellar by the tornado as Jo
tries desperately to follow him. The only thing that
protects her from being swept in is her aunt May and
then the scene moves to present day.
A t this point, I am saying to myself, “Self, that was
cool! M aybe this movie won’t be as bad as every
critic says!”
Well, part of me was right and part of me was
wrong. As the movie shifts to present day, we see
National W eather Service w orkers as they try to put
together the forecasts for our weather. O ne w orker
says to another that today will be one of the worst

days in history for tornados, and with that the film
unravels to shows Bill (Paxton), Jo’s soon to be exhusband and his new fiance driving down the road in
his new truck, in search of Jo. Why, you may ask?
Well, Jo has become a scientist; a tornado chaser
(surprise, surprise), and they must find her to pick up
the divorce papers so that they may get m arried and
start a new life together. Now I say to myself, okay,
a little cheesy. But, maybe the plot will get better.
A nd it does, sort of.
It seems that when Bill and Jo were together, they
were both tornado chasers. Bill came up with a
wonderful device called Dorothy. Its use? To be
placed inside the eye of a tornado to screen data
from it so that scientists can predict the direction of
a tornado faster.

Latest Fishbone Not
Badass, Just Plain Bad
By Lenon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
A round 1988, the band Fishbone came out with an incredible
album titled Truth and Soul , which was a brilliant blend of punk,
funk, ska and underground music. They were friends with another
young, exciting band called the R ed H ot Chili Peppers. M any
thought both bands were destined for greatness and it was only a
m atter of time until the whole world discovered just how great they
were.
The year is now 1996. The R ed H ot Chili Peppers are big
alternative stars who have achieved commercial success by sounding
completely different than they did in ‘88. Fishbone also sounds
different, but they haven’t reached that same level of notoriety. The
reason is because the new album , like the last one, sucks.
T he album , Chim C h im ’s Badass R evenge, is a thoroughly
disappointing collection of songs with no point o r inspiration. The
album starts with an introductory track filled with inside jokes that
try too hard to be funny.Then things really start to go downhill. The
hard, punkish songs sound n o different th^n anything else you will
hear on the radio. The ska sounding songs, for the most part, don’t
work well. '{Tie horns sound like they w ere just thrown into the songs
for effect and d o n ’t really blend with the music. T here are many
ska/punk groups out there that do the same thing, only better. Being
annoying seems to be the only consistent them e present on the
album.
Sitting through the first half o f the album will truly test a person’s
self-control Many times I had to stop myself from skipping to the
next track. Just past the midway point, after the second interlude,
there are two songs that sound like the Fishbone of old. The horns
and guitars blend together, and provide quite a bounce of energy. I
actually started dancing in my chair thinking the band might redeem
themselves and save this record. The fun and excitem ent was,
unfortunately, short lived, and the album returned to the below
average sound found on the rest of the cuts.
Unfortunately, this album blows. It has a sound quite similar to the
last one, which was pretty bad, too. Ever since the band kidnapped
their one group m em ber (long story), they seem to have lost their
direction. Now they are just another band that the Point will play
around the time of their concert. If you want to hear the band at their
finest, find a copy of Truth and Soul, and then you can imagine what
could have been.

However, it was just a dream because he couldn’t
m ake it “fly” into the tornado. Jo, after th eir
separation, made this dream a reality and shows it to
Bill when he comes to get the papers.
Surprisingly (ha ha), it is D orothy’s first run and
before Jo could sign the papers, they must race off to
chase a tornado. Bill and the future wife race quickly
behind them to catch up because they still d o n ’t
have what they came to get and as I am sure you
have already guessed, they see a bunch of tornados
and they reminisce...
All in all, it was a m ediocre film. The love story
thing was pure Hollywood cheese, and of course, all
of the psychological stuff with Jo because of the
incident with the tornado when she was a child was a
little too predictable.
The special effects were great but after the third
tornado, a person gets tired of oohing and ahhing.
The plot, like I said, was a little cheesy, but what
else can you expect if the movie is centered around
the special effects?
This film was one of Spielberg’s lesser films, but I
did think that despite the script, H unt did a good job
for her first m ajor role. Paxton too was good, and no
m atter how hokey, their chemistry worked well.
For $6.50, I wouldn’t see it again. But for a
m atinee price, hom e video or dollar movie, I would
consider it.

It’s not easy being 12.
Just ask my sister Jessica. She can tell
you all about the w orries of life. A nd
believe me, she knows what she’s talking
about. A fter all, she’s already one-half of a
quarter of a century old...
N atural disasters? Yeah, right. A fter
seeing “Twister,” Jessica didn’t think twice
about all of the consequences if a really big
tornado came roaring through the M etro
East. Instead, she thought it would be
rather cool if a tornado ripped through the
theater while we were watching the movie:
“Then we would be hanging onto our seats
and flying up in the air and stuff after the
roof gets blown away.” Ha, ha. Real cool.
O n the way hom e that night, Jessica let
me know what was really m ore im portant
than a silly old funnel cloud. We were
listening to the radio and the d.j. was
dedicating slow songs. The first one was a
song to Jessica from Mike. Hmmm. Now
that’s im portant. “W ho is M ik e?” she
w ondered aloud. “I only know one M ike in
my class.” Hmmm. Who could the mystery
Mike be? I decided not to tell her that
maybe, just maybe, there might be more
than one Mike and one Jessica in the world.
Did I say it wasn’t easy being 12?
I take Jessica to school a few mornings a
week. I t’s really not that hard. G et in the
car. Drive down the street. Turn the corner.
Pull into the grade school parking lot. Stop.
Let her out. Drive on. T hat’s my part.
But Jessica’s part involves a bit m ore
planning. Pet the dog. Look for the cat. Pet
the cat if it can be found. Eventually make
it to the already-idling car. G et in. Turn on

the radio. C hoose a station. O h yeah,
maybe use the seatbelt. O.K., w e’re ready
to roll. WAIT! Forgot the lunch. Replay
everything I just said. O.K., now w e’re
ready. We get to school. But there won’t be
any of that sisterly affection stuff. “D rop
me off here.” “Oh puhleease.Turn the radio
off.” Um, excuse me, but didn’t you choose
that station at the beginning of this little
escapade? Just get out. A nd do n ’t wave.
Now, I ’ll just drive slowly away while she
pretends she doesn’t know me (after all,
what would her friends think?).
12. I’m telling you. It’s not easy.
T here’s so much tp worry about. For
example, you have to worry about which
CD to listen to at what time. You have to
worry about which person to have a crush
on this week. You have to worry about just
who is going to drive you to school and just
where the m ost strategic place is to be
dro p p ed off with the least am ount of
visibility. In o th er words, you have to look,
act and be cool all of the time.
H om ew ork? Deadlines? Job security?
M oney? Bills? Insurance? Stress? No
problem . Any 12-year-old will tell you
where the real stress lies. Just ask my sister.
12. W hat an age. Too bad we can’t be 12
forever.

Volleyball signs talent
for upcoming season
From SIUE Sports Information
Continuing a successful recruiting year,
the SIU E volleyball team has added four
additional signees.
H ead C oach Sandy M ontgom ery
announced this week D iane Beckm ann, of
Aviston, Kelly Saunders, of El D orado,
Ohio, Jennifer W arden, of Vandalia and
Laura W hite, of Jacksonville, have signed
letters of intent to become Cougars for the
1996 season.
Beckm ann, a two-year starter at M ater
Dei High School, capped off her high
school career with a third consecutive state
championship. This past season, the 5-foot8-inch outside hitter had 58 kills, 28 blocks
(13 solos, 15 assists) and eight assists. She
was an honorable m ention selection for the
Bellville News-D em ocrat A ll-A rea team.
A t S IU E , B eckm ann will join form er
team m ate Julie Litteken, of Aviston, who
played on the 1993 and 1994 M ater Dei
state title teams.
M ontgom ery said Beckm ann will help
solidify the defense for the Cougars.
“D iane can play all over and she is a
good passer,” M ontgom ery Said. “She can
hit either left o r right, but she adds m ore to
o ur defense.”
Saunders, a 5-11 left-h an d er from
National Trail High School, was an AllO hio sen io r team and second team
selection. The D istrict 15 Player of the Year
was nam ed the te a m ’s offensive M ost
Valuable Player. In addition to volleyball,
she will display her field event talents for
the SIU E track and field next year.

M ontgom ery said S aunders brings
another hitter to the SIU E arsenal.
“Kelly is a big, strong lefty and she
brings a lot to our strong side,”
M ontgom ery said. “We look for her to be a
big contributor.”
W arden, a 5-11 middle hitter, recorded
38 kills, 80 blocks (56 solos, 24 assists) and
32 digs this past season for Vandalia High
School. She was honored as the team ’s Best
B locker and Spiker and Most Improved
Player. W arden also plays for the Bottom
Line club team.
W arden adds another dimension to the
offense, according to Montgomery.
“Jennifer played middle in high school,
but she can play either side,” M ontgomery
said. “She has really long arms, which
m akes for good blocking potential.”
Rounding out the Cougar recruits is
W hite, a 6-1 outside h itte r from
Jacksonville High School. He* 117 kills, 28
solo blocks and .310 hitting percentage
helped JH S to an overall record of 26-10
and a C entral State 8 conference m arked of
6-1. She was chosen as the team ’s Most
Im proved Player and was a special m ention
selection to the all-conference team.
“L au ra’s size is a big plus and her
blocking is another,” M ontgom ery said.
“For her size, she has good hands and can
set the ball well.”
These four players join newcomers Kim
G ilm an, of Springfield and D onna
H en d erso n , of F lorissant, M o., who
com m itted to SIU E in early signing period.
In its inaugural season, SIU E finished with
an 15-15 overall record and 10-11 in the
GLVC.

St. Louis takes over mediocre central
Photo by Todd Spann/Alestie
The Cardinals brought out the brooms Sunday against Houston as
they swept the division leading Astros to gain a tie for top spot in the
central division. With Houston having Monday off and St. Louis
defeating San Diego, the Cardinals found themselves alone in first
place on Tuesday. The two teams are currently going in different
directions as the Cardinals are riding a five game winning streak
and Houston has lost three straight games. Both teams are still under
500 and the rest of the division is close behind.
