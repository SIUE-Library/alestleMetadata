Famous poet reads literary works at SIUE
By David Weil
News Reporter
D arlene Roy read samples of her poetry on Wednesday,
A pril 2, in the Lovejoy Library A uditorium as part of theM M
1996 Reading Series. The series is dedicated to exposing SIU E
students to talented authors of diverse cultural background.
“We are less interested in art for a rt’s sake. While that may
be im portant, we want people who have som ething to say,” said
Eugene Redm ond, organizer of the 1996 Reading Series.
R edm ond opened the reading by welcoming students with
the Swahili phrases “H abari gani,” which is a casual greeting,
and “Njem e,” a positive response. R edm ond went on to give
some brief highlights of R oy’s career as a writer.
R oy’s writing has appeared in Black Am erican Literature
Forum , Literati Chicago, Am erican Poetry A nthology and
Break Word With the World. Roy also serves as associate editor
of Drumvoices Review and has had her poetry displayed in over
fifty M etroLink trains and B i-State buses as part of the
M etroL ink/A rt Transit program .
“D arlene Roy is a m ajor figure in the literary, cultural, and
educational rebirth of this region,” said Redm ond.
Roy continued the them e of culture by greeting students
with the Swahili greeting “Ire A she,” before beginning her

i n

readings. Roy also expressed her pleasure to be back at SIU E,
her alma mater, for the reading.
“It’s wonderful to be here this morning, to be invited to read
and to come back to the university,” said Roy.
Roy went on to read several examples of her original poetry,
including the poem “Black Bridge B lues” that appeared on
M etro/Link trains and Bi-State buses. R oy’s poetry ranged from
the distinctly personal “Moving O n,” w ritten with her divorce
in mind but relating to any time of moving on, to the m ore
political “Malcolm M orphesis,” an exam ination of the hum an
pow er to change from within.
“O ne of the things we can learn from ‘M alcolm ’ is the fact
that we can change. We can come from now here to everywhere
involving everything and everybody,” said Roy.
In addition to her own work, Roy read a poem from local
w riter H enry Dum as called “ Play Ebony, Play Ivory.” Roy also
read a poem by R edm ond titled “Carryover,” a tribute to the
pow er of the residents of E. St. Louis—past, present, and
future.
R edm ond then thanked Roy and the audience before
inviting everyone to have punch and cookies outside the
auditorium .
Roy was the third of four scheduled writers in the 1996
Reading Series. The final author will be poet and critic Michael
C astro of R iver Styx magazine.

State and Local--------------------------------------Teen hacker accused of security breach
• A St. Louis teen-ager arrested last week near Philadelphia on computer fraud
charges is more than just a kid with a hobby—and far more dangerous, federal
authorities say.
Christopher Schanot, 19, of High Ridge, Mo., is a computer genius who “hacked”
his way into the computers of some of the nation’s largest companies, causing security
breaches that forced at least one company to spend thousands of dollars fixing.
Authorities have linked him to a group of hackers called the Internet Liberation
Front and say he’s capable of seizing control of virtually any computer and wreaking
havoc.

Marriage request rejected by deacon
• An all-white church that backed down from an attempt to remove a mixed-race
baby from its cemetery is refusing to marry the child’s parents or let them join the
church, the family said Tuesday.
Lila Wireman, the baby’s great-grandmother, said deacon Logan Lewis told her
the child’s parents, Jamie Wireman and Jeffrey “Bubba” Johnson, would not be
allowed to wed at Barnetts Creek Baptist Church.

Study: shots effective in blocking conception
• Weekly injections of testosterone reduce the sperm count of almost all men to
below the threshold needed for conception, according to a study published Tuesday
by the World Health Organization in London.
The 2 1/2-year study of 399 couples in nine countries found that the injections were
an effective contraception for 98.6 percent, according to the report in Fertility and
Sterility, the journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Police guard dorms after robbery attempt, shot fired
FITCHBURG, Mass. (AP)—The first-ever shooting
at Fitchburg State College had campus and state police
both trying to ease student fears while investigating the
robbery attempt.
;
One male student and one female student said they
were about to enter a townhouse-style residence hall at
about 9:45 p.m. Sunday when they were approached by
two men wearing masks. One of the men was carrying a
handgun, said school spokesman Michael Shanley.
As the two students fled inside the building, one of the
men fired into the hallway after them. Police could not
find any trace of the men but they did find three bullet
casings and one round embedded in the side of the

building. They also found bullet holes in the hallway
Neither student was injured.
Some students have questioned whether attending the
school is too risky. A flood of telephone calls to students
from concerned parents followed news reports of the
assault.
“I talked to my mom, and she said, ‘If something’s not
done, you’re not going back,”’ said Jeffrey Meola, a
sophomore from Shrewsbury who lives in the 40-student
dorm where the shooting occurred. “Everybody’s shaken
up, and if something’s not done they’re going to lose a lot
o f students. A college education is not worth my life.”
The city’s mayor agreed to supplement the college’s

security staff with city police, Shanley said. School
officials were also holding meetings with students to
discuss safety measures such as using the school’s escort
service.
“This is the first shooting incident we’ve ever had on
t
campus,” Shanley said. “One of the neighborhoods
adjacent to campus was a source of trouble at one point
but we’ve never had a shooting on campus.”
Arming the campus police, an option under review for
several months, has moved closer to reality, college
president Michael P. Riccards said. The decision to assign
weapons to qualified campus police officers comes down
to students’ right to a safe environment, he said.

University of
Oklahoma
limits access to
computer porn
N O R M A N , Okla. (A P)—
U niversity of O klahom a
officials are m oving to
elim inate the availability of
pornography
on
cam pus
com puters, a problem they
say is com m on to networks
th at have access to the
Internet.
“While no group or agency
with com puter access has the
ability to control or elim inate
the virtually unlimited mass
of m aterial tran sm itted on
com puter
netw orks,
the
university certainly wants to
do everything it can to reduce
the misuse of our system by
those who transm it obscene
m aterial, and the university
will do its best to fully comply
with the law as it relates to
obscene m aterial,” C atherine
Bishop,
the
university’s
associate vice president for
public affairs, said Monday.
T he university, Ms. Bishop
said, has established a task
force com posed o f the
general counsel’s office, the
provost’s office and the Office
of
C om puting
and
Telecommunications Services
to examine the problem .
O U “has already taken
steps to limit access to the
most obvious addresses from
which to obtain what could be
legally defined as obscene
m aterial," Ms. Bishop said.
“A t this point, it does not
ap p ear th at the m aterial
originated on the O U campus
or even within O klahom a,”
she said.
State Rep. Fred Perry, RTulsa, said that at the request
of Oklahom ans for Children
and Fam ilies, an E dm ondbased organization that fights
pornography, he spoke last
week with O U p resident
David Boren about obscene
pictures o b tain ed from the
Internet.
Perry said B oren was
surprised to learn about the
obscenity, and
th at he
prom ised to take steps to
rem ove access to obscene
materials.
“This is a tax-supported
com puter system ,” he said.
“Do parents send their kids to
school to access this kind of
inform ation?”
Bob
A n d erso n ,
the
president of Oklahom ans for
Children and Families, said it
was his understanding that
O U began blocking access to
certain com puter inform ation
on Sunday.
“ We d o n ’t think public
m oney should be sp ent to
fu rth er this addiction to
pornography that I’m sure
m any peo p le have down
there,” he said.

From a ‘Roar to a Meow’
What ever happened
to SlUE’s real
cougar mascots
B y N ik k i H a lv a c h s
For t h e A le s t le
Taking the long walk from the parking lots to the classrooms, it wasn't
too long ago that students were able to witness the walking of our
school mascot. Our mascot has been around for about 30 years but not
always in the form we know today. Do we really know the history of our
m ascot? How many people know how our mascot was developed? After
speaking with a few fellow students, 1 learned that many do not know
the unique history of our mascot.
In Ju n e of 1966 it was decided that S IU E needed a mascot. After
months of discussion, a student by the name of Chris Henderson
submitted the idea of having a
cougar as a m ascot. After
much discussion, the idea of a
live
cougar w as
brought
forward. It was not until the
fall quarter o f 1967 that the
adm inistration and student
body agreed to obtain a live
cougar mascot. The following
reasons were given when
asked why: it would build
recognition for SIU E, it would
prom ote school spirit and
unity among students and it
would
develop
a
unique
symbol for the campus.
The first mascot, Chimega,
was born on Aug. 26, 1967, at
the San Diego Zoo. Chimega
was acquired by Thom as
Blackshear when she was two
w eeks
old.
Due
to
an
unfortunate
accident,
Black sh ear was killed in a
plane crash at the age of 3 i.
His mother, Mrs. Nonette
Lewis,
agreed
to donate
Chimega to S IU E in her son's
honor. On Feb. 19, 1968, the sixmonth-old cougar arrived on In past school years, live cougars were a.visible
campus.
When S IU E first received the cougar, her name was Danie. Her name
change occurred after the 1968 “ Springiest” held a “ nam e the Cougar”
contest. The nam e Chimega was chosen because it m eans "cougar" in
the Apache language.
A student organization entitled "The Cougar Guard" was formed to
care for Chimega. They accom panied her to many athletic events,
university functions, th eater productions and various public
appearances. She even starred in a television com m ercial run on KPLR
Channel 11 for a St. Louis Lincoln-Mercury dealer.
Chim ega was retired from making personal appearances after
returning from the Illinois State Fair in 1981. Chimega remained in her
domed cage, which was divided in 1983 to house her and a younger
cougar, until she died on March 12, 1985, of natural causes. She was'
17 years and six months old at the time of her death. Chimega was
buried by the lake in front of Building II.
The second live mascot that S IU E had was Kyna; whose name meant
“ wise or graceful lady.” Kyna was of an eighth generation of cougars in
captivity. She was born on Ju n e 1, 1982, in Florissant, Mo. SIU E

purchased her on Ju ly 20, 1982, for $500. The funds were provided by
the Student Activities Special Request Fund.
Kyna was boarded until she was old enough to be placed in the
domed cage on Ja n . 22, 1983. Ju s t as with Chimega, she had to be
declawed and have her canine fangs filed. Also like Chimega, she made
trips and sideline appearances under restraints. Kyna's last public
appearance was in Septem ber of 1986, pending resolution of insurance
and care questions.
After much controversy regarding Kyna, many concerns suddenly
surfaced. Records show
that in nearly 20 years
of
their presence on
cam pus and o f their
co n tact with cam pus
personnel,
neither
Chimega nor Kyna had
caused injury to a
Cougar Guard member
or any other person.
However,
authorities
consulted and agreed
that cougars in such
circum stances retain an
“ attack reflex” for selfdefense when they get
excited. This has the
potential o f causing
serious injury.
O ther
concerns
were
the
liability,
financial costs, and
housing repairs needed
in order to maintain a
live cougar. SIU E was
forced to carry coverage
for every m em ber of the
Cougar Guard in case of
in ju ry
(costing

including the other trainers
that were involved with Kyna). The student activity fund covered just
enough for the basic essentials, but not a penny more. Kyna's cage had
been standing for a number of years and the foundation of the cage was
in desperate need of repairs. It had the potential for severe security
problems. The repairs could have ranged anywhere from $10,000 to
$42,000.
In consideration of the evidence presented, the dean of students
concluded that in the best interest of the students and the university,
Kyna's ownership needed to be transferred to M/M Exotics. M/M Exotics,
a walk-through exotic animal park, was located on 52 acres and was
fully licensed, meeting federal and state inspections.
Our current mascot was introduced in 1985 by then-Athletic Director
Lynn Lashbrook. The mascot is a cougar-costumed student called
“ Cory.” Cory has becom e the sole “ mascot” for public, athletic and
university events.
Our school is no longer unique in the idea of maintaining a live
mascot. As the years have progressed, isn't it a shame that our school
has settled for owning a costumed mascot as opposed to a real one? We
have gone from a “ roar” to a “ meow.”

By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor

Melissa W athen/A/esf/e

Jason Geminn serves up another point in his 6-3,6-2 singles victory over USI
W ednesday night at the SIUE tennis courts. The Cougars won the match 5-2.

A fter a tough w eekend, the SIU E
m en’s tennis team bounces back with a
solid victory over the University of
S outhern Indiana to tak e th eir
conference record to 3-2 and overall
m ark to 3-5.
“We needed this win. We have some
tough m atches coming up, so this win
■helps out a lot,” E than H alberg said
after the Cougars beat USI 5-2.
The Cougars started things off oh a
roll with doubles by sweeping through
the three matches. H alberg and Jason
G em inn took care of the No. 1 position
winning 8-2. Followed by N ate R eede
and Callen H anks taking care of No. 2
doubles and M att H anks and B rett
Licata winning an exciting 9-8 m atch at
the No. 3 doubles.
The Cougars did not stop there.
G em inn was the earliest to depart from
the court on singles b eating his
opponent 6-3,6-2 at the No. 2 singles.
M. Hanks needed a second set tie
breaker and a late rally to defeat U S I’s
Chris D eaton. Down 4-1 in the second,
H anks comes from behind to win 6-4,
7-6(7-3) at No. 5 singles.
“H e was down 4-1 and suddenly he
snapped out of it and got going. A nd
when he gets up, he really gets up,”
head coach Bill Logan said after H anks
match.

A n exciting three set match was won
by R eede at No. 3 singles 5-7, 6-1, 6-4
but the Cougars also dropped a tough
three set m atch with C. Hanks at No. 4
singles 6-0,4-6,6-2.
T hen H alberg topped off the
evening with a 7-6(7-4), 6-4 victory at
No. 1 singles.
Overall, Logan was pleased with
what he saw and is happy to see his
players bounce back and get a good
win.
“Hopefully this will give us a lift. If
we go into this weekend against the
tough schools of Ferris and Northwood
and m ake a good showing, it should
strengthen our players,” Logan s a id .'
Logan wants to be ready for the
conference tournam ent and he knows
if they beat the team s they should beat
then they should get a good draw in the
tournam ent. Plus, playing well against
Bellarm ine and o ther top schools will
help out also.
“Playing tough team s like Ferris and
N orthw ood will help us play better in
the conference. A nd wins like this one
sure helps the ole moral,” Logan said.
The C ougars will p re p are for a
tough weekend with top program s in
th e region. B oth Ferris and Northwood
are som e of th e best com petition
around.
The tough play should get the
Cougars in tone for the stretch run in
he conference.

Baseball wins big Softball sweeps a pair from Fontbonne
over Harris-Stowe
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter

By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor
Senior Brian G eluck hit a grand slam and a
double to drive in six runs and lead the SIU E
baseball team to a 19-8 victory at Harris-Stowe
College Tuesday afternoon.
The C ougar offense lit up the H ornets pitching
early and often in the non-conference victory that
pushed their record to 17-10.
H ead coach G ary Collins said he was pleased to
see his offense .come out and put a lot of runs on
the board. O ne of the best aspects was the
production they got throughout the lineup as 10 of
the 12 Cougars who appeared at the plate collected
at least one hit.
“It was a nice day out. The w eather was warm,
the sun was shining— it was just a good day to hit,”
Collins said.
A lthough the team was successful at the plate,
Collins was not pleased with the way his pitchers
perform ed.
“O ur pitching has been very average since we
returned from Florida,” Collins said. “W e’re giving
up too many walks and falling behind too many
hitters.”
The Cougars jum ped out to a 3-0 lead in the top
of the first when, with the bases loaded, sophom ore
M ark Briggs doubled to clear the bases.
The H ornets struck back quickly in the bottom
of th e inning, scoring three of their own off Cougar
starting pitcher John Ebersohl.
T he C ougars, how ever, struck again in the
second w hen they pushed three m ore runs home.
From that point on, the Cougars never looked
back as they added a couple m ore big innings,
please see BASEBALL, next page

Two decisive wins over F ontbonne
College on Tuesday gave the S IU E
softball team an outstanding 19-7 overall
record for the season.
The first game of the doubleheader saw
freshm an Jessica Silbe im prove her
pitching record to 7-6 with a 5-0 shutout of
Fontbonne.
Christy Perry led the offensive charge
with three hits and two RBI. Michele*
Sucich had two hits and scored a run.
Jenny Hagel added two hits and scored
two runs.
The offense picked up even m ore in the
second game as the Cougars won 16-3.
A n R B I triple from Sucich helped
SIU E score five in the second inning to
put the game out of reach early.
Lisa Ness pounded out three hits and
drove in four RBI while scoring three
times. Shortstop Jamie Thorp contributed
three hits, an RBI and a run scored.
Jen n ife r-Y o rk e and A shley H o rto n
added two hits and two runs scored apiece.
Stephanie Stinson recorded the victory
on the m ound which improves her record
to an unblem ished 5-0.
H ead coach Sandy M ontgom ery was
unavailable for com m ent on Wednesday
afternoon as she and the Cougars are in
Indianapolis for six G reat Lakes Valley
C onference games to start this weekend.
They will play lU P U -F o rt Wayne,
Bellarm ine and Indianapolis in two games

Men’s, women’s track run well outdoors
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
It was a day of personal bests for the SIU E
track, team as they com peted for the first time
outdoors at Washington University over the
past weekend.
T hree w om en runners and three men
runners went out and ran their best times in
their respective races.
“It was a great start for the outdoor season,”
H ead coach Darryl Frerker said Wednesday
afternoon. “Six runners broke personal records
and that’s a great start to the outdoor season.”
K endra Newell was one of the women
runners to break a personal record as she took
sixth in the 1500-meter with a tim e of 4
minutes, 55.6 seconds.
Colleen Casey also ran the 1500-meter and
followed just behind Newell in 8th place with a
time of 4:56.7.
In the 400-meter dash Becky Hagenbrunch
broke a personal record, taking second with a
time of 1:1.84. She also ran the 200-meter and
took sixth.
“Becky is really running well,” F rerker said.
L aquetta Dobbs also ran in the 200-meter
race for the Cougars and com peted in the 100meter. That was the first time in a while that
SIU E has had com petitors in the 200 and 100m eter dash.
Vicki Johnson was the final runner for the
women to gain a personal record and she did it
in the 3000-meter, finishing fifth overall with a
time of 10:46.85.
It was Travis Roundcount leading the way

Baseball --------------------------from p a g e 12

including a five-run fourth and a four-run
eighth that featured G eluck’s grand slam.
“Brian has been a model of consistency,”
Collins said about his offensive star. “H e has
been hitting the ball well since day one.”
Briggs finished the day 3-for-5 with four

for the men as he took second in the 1500m eter, losing by two-hundredths of a second.
“H e ran a awesome race,” Frerker said. “It
was a personal best for Travis and he just ran
really great.”
Along with Roundcount in the 1500 was
Jason Gass who took sixth place, breaking a
personal record. Chris Wolf finished seventh
and Wayne Bloem er came in 12th.
R oundcount also ran in the 800-meter in
which he won with a time of one minute, 56.72
seconds.
Keeping with the personal records, Luke
Lay did it in the 400-meter, taking 5th place
with a time of 51.2 seconds. H e then took 5th
place in the 200-meter with the time of 23.59
seconds. M att Noyes also ran the 400-meter,
taking 15th place.
The Cougars keep looking m ore like a full
track team and now they have a long jum per in
Noyes. H e took 12th with a jum p of 18 feet,
11.25 inches.
A nother good run was by Gus C oronado in
the 5000-meter in which he took third with a
time of 15:16.35 seconds. G eorge Patrylak also
ran, with a 13th place finish.
“G eorge is just getting back in form. He got
injured in the cross country season and he is on
the road to recovery.”
Overall, Frerker is very pleased with the
way his team came out strong for the outdoor
m eet and he is really looking forward to the
next outing.
“I am very pleased with what I saw. It looks
like it is going to be a very enjoyable
competitive season,” Frerker said.
RBI. Shortstop Jeff Silvey also contributed in
a big way by going 2-for-3 and scoring four
runs.
The C ougars now p re p are for a big
w eekend of action as they host three
conference opponents.
“This w eekend is huge with a capital H , ”
Collins said. “E ither we get back in the race
or we put ourselves in a lot of trouble.”
