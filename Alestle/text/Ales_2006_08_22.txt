SIUE gets to work on move-in day
by Aaron Sudholt
Alestle News Editor

Move-in day returned to SIUE Friday when
thousands o f students arrived to campus housing.
More than 3,000 students moved into
residence halls and Cougar Village apartments over
the weekend.
Even before official move-in day Friday, more
than 150 residents had already moved in. Movers
and Shakers, the move-in crews who help the rest
of SIUE move in to their housing, had already
moved in earlier in the week. International
students, along with student athletes, had moved
in already as well.
“Athletes have been in for weeks because o f
their practices,” Housing Director Michael Schultz
said.
Individuals living in the residence halls had to
come to the Morris University Center at an
appointed time and check-in before they could
move in to their rooms.
The Movers and Shakers offered assistance
moving in students to their dorm rooms, keeping
movements orderly and helping residents get their
things in as quickly as possible.

Tag prices go up since last year
by Aaron Sudholt
Alestle News Editor

With the new semester
comes an increase in parking pass
prices, which have risen from last
year’s rates by $12 each.
Parking passes for the red
lots and a yellow pass for the
residence halls have risen from
last year’s rate o f $60 to $72 per
pass. Motorcycle passes have
risen from $50 to $62 and passes
for disabled students went from
$60 to $72.
Green and brown passes
raised from $100 to $112. The
same process for getting both
passes has been kept.
At a May 2 meeting, the
Southern Illinois University
Board o f Trustees approved
several price increases for fees for
students beginning in the fall

semester. SIUE did not object at
the meeting, even though there
was a presence o f SIUC students
who voiced problems
with the proposed
increases.
Reactions
residents were
concerning the
o f the increases.
“Honestly,
don’t really care,”
senior biology major
Lara Litde said. “I
pay whatever for the
brown pass.”
Other students’
reactions were not as
positive.
“I don’t like it. It’s not fair to
us,” sophomore construction
management
major
Grant
Drawve said. “I expected it.”
Others
considered
the
benefits o f having parking

services and maintenance on the
lots.
“I think the increase at first
was bad, but it benefits the
students as a whole,”
freshman
nursing
major Jaleesa Carter
said.
Parking in the
red lots will be open
for the first week o f
classes, however after
that anyone parking on
campus outside o f the
pay-by-the-hour guest
lots will have to have
permits
or
face
ticketing.
Tickets for parking in the
wrong lot begins at $15, and will
continue up in cost until hitting
$55 for further incidents.

e-ID policy forces changing password
by Aaron Sudholt
Alestle News Editor

Following an audit by the
Illinois General Auditor Office,
SIUE e-IDs must be changed
more often.
Every 60 days students will
be required to change their user
password on their e-ID. As part
o f the requirements from the
Auditor General, the university
must increase security on its
campus computers.
“Their audit finding was our
network wasn’t secure enough,”

Academic Computing Director
John Drueke said last summer
just before the policy was
implemented.
The new policy has two
parts. First, students must change
their passwords every 60 days.
Second, those passwords must
not be any o f die previous six
passwords they have used.
This policy will require
students returning to SIUE for
the fall semester to change their
passwords before accessing their
Webmail, for example.
Services affected include

Blackboard, SIUE Webmail and
logging in to computers in
Lovejoy Library and computer
labs.
Kiosks have been set up in
the Morris University Center and
help desks have been set up in the
Cougar Village Commons and
residence hall lobbies.
For assistance, seek those
help desks or call the Faculty
Technology Center at 650-5697
or call Office o f Technology
Customer Support at 650-3739.

by a number,” Schultz said.
O f the total number o f
people moving in on campus,
1,233 were freshmen.
For
Cougar
Village,
residents were allowed to arrive
at any given time during the day,
sign in and then move into their
apartments once they had their
keys.
Rain did not cause problems
moving in, keeping the whole o f
the event itself and resident’s

valuables dry.
Before move-in day, Schultz
said that organization was
important to making sure things
went smoothly in years past.
“ We usually have good
comments,” he said. “We were
very well organized.”

I
am writing this letter
you because I have absolutely no
idea who else to write it to, or
how else to have my thoughts
heard. I cannot for the life o f me
understand why this university

Editor

We all know
what we have to do: pick out our
classes, try desperately to get an
appointment with our adviser,
finally tell our adviser which
classes we need so that they may
tell us, “ Well I’m not sure if you
... Oh yeah, that will work for
you,” (because we all know that
most o f them cannot do any
actual advising themselves), then
once we are finally in our classes

to
wait until some otfier mishap
(like the class gets closed, the
requirements for major/minor are
changed ... ) goes into action.
If you have been dropped
from your class, accidentally
signed up for the wrong one,
couldn’t get into the one you
really wanted or have to run
around campus getting a million
different signatures from three
different buildings all the while
checking Cougarnet every five
minutes to make sure the opening
still exists. I cannot understand
why SIUE does not let students
sign up for classes on their own,
like all other universities in the
U.S.
Wouldn’t it be simpler to just
have an initial meeting with your
adviser a month or a few weeks
before the actual sign-up date, so
the adviser wouldn’t feel as
rushed to get you signed up and

could actually advise? This
meeting could go over what you
have taken and what you will
need to take. Then the adviser
would simply lift a hold on that
student, so when the date o f
matriculation comes around the
student could log onto the
Internet, pick his or her class and
select “add.” This is how it works
at many other universities. I say it
is high time SIUE jump on the
bandwagon'.
O f course, the student would
still lose his or her place in the
class if he or she did not pav
tuition. This would
make
everyone’s lives easier and more
efficient. Hopefully someone will
take into consideration my issues
with our current system and make
a change. Please SIUE, we really
need it.

Perspective: It should not cost more to be poor
Being poor is not cheap.
People who live in low-income
areas o f urban America pay more
for many things.
That’s not shocking news.
But it is surprising just how much
more goods and services cost the
___
people who are
least able to
afford it. The socalled “ghetto
tax” is detailed in
~ a new report
from the Brookings Institute,
“From Poverty, Opportunity,”
available
at
www.brook.edu/metro/pubs/200
60718_povop.htm.
The report makes clear that
the conventional strategy for
fighting poverty, demanding jobs
for the poor, is an inadequate

From
the
Wire

remedy unless paired with
protection against price gouging
on everything from furniture to
mortgages.
Doubters should add up the
numbers, as Brookings scholar
Matt Fellowes did. He crunched
national data, as well as
information from 12 cities from
across the country.
The research shows, for
example, that about 4.5 million
lower-income families pay at least
2 percentage points more in loan
interest rates than families with
incomes o f $60,000 to $90,000,
9.2 percent annual percentage
rate compared to 7.2 percent. The
same disparity was found in first
mortgages. In 2004, the average
APR was about 6.9 percent for
low-income
households,

compared to 6 percent for
households with incomes o f
$60,000 or more.
“We’ve got to be thinking
more about what happens to poor
people’s income, how much more
they have to pay for everything,”
Fellowes said in an interview.
By his estimate, cutting the
costs o f essential goods and
services in urban America by just
1 percent would put as much as
$6.5 billion in the pockets o f loW income consumers. That number
alone should be enough to ignite
a new debate about addressing
poverty in this country.

“There’s nothing to do here.”
If I had a dollar for every time
I heard this phrase last year ...
well, I wouldn’t be dining on
Ramen noodles quite so often.
We’ve • all
heard it - and
probably thought
it - before. Often
times, it appears
that SIU E has
very little campus
life. Maybe it’s
because we have
such
a
large
Megan
c o mm u t e r
McClure p o p u l a t i o n .
Maybe
it’s
because so many students are here
to “get a degree and get out.”
Whatever the reason, this
assumption is not true. On any
given day, a number o f activities
take place on campus. For
students, finding entertainment is
just a matter o f taking advantage
of the opportunities at hand.
This fact is especially true
during Welcome Week. Even as I
write this, the Goshen Lounge is
packed with students gathering
for the Activities Fair. As I walked
through earlier, the excitement
was contagious. It was great to see
such enthusiasm from so many
groups o f students.
The list o f Welcome Week
activities is extensive. From the
pig roast on Wednesday to Rocky
Horror on Thursday to the Block
Party on Friday, there is most
definitely something to do every
day this week.
However, opportunities for
fun aren’t restricted to special
events. Don’t forget to take
advantage o f the warm weather as
summer comes to a close. Cougar
Lake Pool and the Marina are still
open for the season. Also, now is
a great time to get in a game o f
tennis or sand volleyball before
the weather turns cold.
Additionally, the fall sports
season is about to kick off, making
this a great time to cheer on the
Cougars. Student organizations
are also starting up the year,
providing students a multitude of
ways to get involved on campus.
As for right now, though,
Welcome Week activities are
available to fill students’ free time.
Just pick up a schedule and you’re
on your way.
So - for the next week, at
least - there’s something to do. It’s
simply a matter o f taking
advantage o f the opportunity.

Bring on the champions
Cougars ready to take
on top-ranked team
by Matthew Bruce
Alestle Sports Editor

Practice season is over and
it’s time for the season that
matters to kick into gear. And for
the SIU E men’s soccer team,
things will be kicking into high
gear.
The Cougars kick o ff an
ambitious 2006 schedule when
they take on NCAA-Division II
defending champion Fort Lewis
College, the No. 1 team in the
nation, at 5 p.m. Friday in
Denver.
The Cougars are by no
means in a slump. The Cougars
enter the regular season as the
No. 4 team in the country.
“We’re highly regarded, but
we are not going to dodge
anybody,” SIUE Head Coach Ed
Huneke said. “They are the top
dogs, so it is going to be a good
dogfight.”
If SIU E wants to be
successful in its season opener, it
will have to hold the Skyhawks’

The Cougars won the
game 4-2 on penalty
kicks and advanced to
the NCAA Division II
Quarterfinals for the
third time in five years.
Beveridge was the
Cougars’
secondleading scorer with
seven goals in 2005. He

Outstanding Offensive Player in

“They have a good striker in
Cunliffe,” Huneke said. “H e’s
going to have to be contained.
Also,
we’ll
have
to
be
unhampered by the altitude. And
then we are going to have to play
good soccer.”
Huneke has made it clear
that he wants to pit his team
against
championship-caliber
opponents early in the season to
prepare them for the playoffs.
SIUE does not stop at Fort
Lewis with the high level o f
competition during the first
month o f the season. The
Cougars take on No. 12

noon on Sunday, Aug. 27 in

MEN’S SOCCER/pg.15

Spikers enter new season strong
Solid preseason
gives coach promise
for young team
by Nicholas Johnson
Alestle Sports Stringer

Katy Hartwig /Alestle

Sophomore setter Mallory Clements goes vertical in a recent
practice. Clements takes over the setter position after four-year
starter Krystal Majernik left with 4,159 assists.

If SIUE Head Coach Todd
Gobcr was anxious about his
team’s fate in 2006, the SIUE
volleyball team did a good job o f
putting some o f those worries to
rest with a solid showing in
August.
The Cougars are coming off
a superb preseason that was
capped off by a solid two-week
run heading into the season,
which gives Gober a reason to
breathe easy. The Cougars have a
new style o f play, but the goal is
still the same: to win.
“Last year we were a really
physical, power team. It was
pretty much bump, set, kill,”
Gober said. “This year, we’re
more bump, set, throw it to the
deep corner, make a big dig, tip
(it) over the block and then
finally get a kill. So we’re going
to be a more defensive-oriented
team. (Well) kind o f scramble
around, just dive all over the
place, get the ball o ff and really
work hard to get the points. It’s

going to be a different mix for
us.”
Sophomore
Mallory
Clements and senior Tricia
Happe led the team o f 19, which
includes six new players.
Clements, the team’s new
starting setter, was a dominant
force in many drills, and was the
grand champion o f the team’s
sand
court
volleyball
competition. She takes over the
reins left vacant by four-year
player Krystal Majernik, whose
4,159 career assists are second alltime on the SIUE list.
Gober was impressed with
the leadership Happe has shown,
as well as her confidence in her
game. Happe will be the team’s
starting opposite hitter.
“She’s our attitude on the
floor,” Gober said. “ So she’s
going to have a huge role
however we use her.”
Sophomore Kate Hofeldt
and junior Kim Potthast will start
as the team’s outside hitters. The
middle hitters will feature a
rotation o f freshman Lisa
Heitkamp, sophomore Kelsey
Hubert, junior Ruth Shurts and
senior Jamie Jones.
“That’s where your fast
offense comes is how quickly you
run your middles. That’s going to
be a challenge for us,” Gober

said. “I see us having the
potential to be a very explosive,
quick team like we were last year.
And I think we’ve got a great
group o f young ladies competing
for the middle-hitter position.”

“I see us having
the potential to
be a very
explosive, quick
team like we
were last year.”
-Todd Gober,
SIUE Head Coach
The team’s role players
include sophomore Emily Rahn,
junior Sadie Zurliene and
freshman Tiffany Turner.
Gober
believes
the
scrimmages against the alumni
team was the defining moment o f
the preseason. H e and SIU E
assistant coach Katie Gilman
stressed the importance o f
competitiveness and intensity
during the preseason, which

MEN’S SOCCER
from pg. 11

press release o f his decision to
schedule such tough opposition
earh in die year, ‘i t will give us
and our players an idea at the
start what we need to do to be a
champion.”
SIUE is coming o ff an
uplifting preseason campaign.
Huneke found an unexpected
sign o f hope in the team’s ability
to punch the ball to the back of
the net.
The Cougars played three
preseason games, including a
match with Eastern Illinois
University on Sunday, and scored
four goals in each o f the contests.
“ It
was
somewhat
uncharacteristic in terms o f our
offensive output,’’ Huneke said.
“Typically goal scoring is not that
easy, especially early in the year.
But I like nice surprises.”
There are still a couple o f
lineup questions looming in the
air, but Huneke has figured out
who his starters will be for the
most part.
All-American senior Kevin
Thibodeau will flank the
Cougars’ backfield, playing in the
middle with newcomer Zach
Bauer, a sophomore transfer from
Boston University.
On the outskirts, the
Cougars will field senior Mike
Zaegel and freshman Randy Roy.
“ Randy is proving the move
to college to be a good
transition,” Huneke said.
In the midfield, the Cougars
will remain virtually the same
with seniors Mike Banner, John
Matthews and last year’s leading
scorer Victor Pacheco returning.
Junior St. Louis Community
College at Meramec transfer
Patrick Brazill joins the pack in

the middle.
The scene at the goal posts
will be the same as last year with
juniors Nicholas Frasca and Greg
Crook sharing duties at the
keeper slot.
Huneke will also expect
freshmen Tim Weir and Kevin
Bielicki, sophomore Bob Ridder
and junior Ross Beveridge to
provide some punch.
“ We have a lot o f new
players providing contributions,”
Huneke said. “Some still have to
prove themselves.
“Depth is always important,”
Huneke said. “ There’s always
going to be injuries. It can be a
long grueling season if you don’t
have any depth on your team.”
The jury is out on the team’s
character, but the outlook seems
good.
“I don’t know yet. It’s still
early,” Huneke said. “Typically
defense has been one o f our
hallmarks, but if we keep scoring
like this, we will be right there on
both sides o f the ball.”
The Cougars hit Korte
Stadium for their home opener at
7 p.m. Friday, Sept. 1 when they
take on Christian Brothers
University, a team that handed
SIUE a loss in its season debut
last year. Huneke knows that
SIUE will be a big date on many
o f its opponents’ schedules.
Huneke said one o f the
team’s biggest challenges is
“being ready to live up to our
high rankings and status when
good teams are putting a target
on our backs.”
