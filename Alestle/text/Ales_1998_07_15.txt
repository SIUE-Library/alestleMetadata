One more soldier comes home

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
Students living on campus housing will have
to wait a little longer to receive their phone bills
from the new campus phone system.
Due to the implementation of the new
campus phone system, a rush was placed to get
the access codes out to the students on campus
housing so they could use the phones. Phone bills
will not be ready until the end of July. They will
be distributed the second Thursday of August.
According
to
Telecommunications
Coordinator Terry Meredith, the system wasn’t
originally scheduled to be activated until the fall.
At the time, neither the Bursar’s Office nor the
Telecommunications Office was capable of
handling billing.
For students worried about their bills, they
can find out their current billing statements
through
the
Housing
website,
ww.siue.edu/TELECOM/, by using the ID
numbers given to them and their seven digit
telephone authorization codes.
Students can also start paying off their

Arboretum is completed and open for the public to enter
■ BY DANIELLE BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
The Donal G. Myers Arboretum
was dedicated and completed last
Tuesday evening in a ceremony to
commemorate the completion of an
idea Dr. Myers proposed over 10
years ago.
The arboretum, which features
stones erected in dedication to past
foundation
presidents, beautiful
woodland and a bridge over large off­
shoot pond of Cougar Lake, was
funded by money raised by the

Foundation Administration, a fund­
raising vehicle for the university. By
holding annual fund drives and
contacting SIUE alumni to generate
funds, the administration was able to
bring Dr. Myers’ dream to life.
Besides the bridge, a fountain has
also been placed in the lake the bridge
spans over. The opening to the
arboretum is located along the former
Delyte W. Morris bike trail and near
the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity house.
The opening features a stone sign
with engraving of the names of people
and families who helped contribute.

The arboretum continues along a trail
that leads into a portion of the
woodland, along a trail of stone
benches with the names of former
foundation presidents and their years
served engraved in them. Other
benches can be also found with the
names of contributors to the arboretum
engraved in them. As the trail
continues it leads towards the small
lake and the bridge that spans over it.
The Myers Arboretuem’s bridges
are open, and students and staff are
encouraged by the foundation to
partake in them.

Retirement options grow for thousands of university employees
CHAMPAIGN, 111. (AP) — Until this
month, Jane Stalter had not thought
about her retirement plan because she
was automatically enrolled in the
one system available when she was
hired by the University of Illinois 11
years ago.
Now she has several choices. And
she likes it.

enhance the beauty of the landscape.

More than 70,000 employees of
public universities and community
colleges across the state are now or
will soon become eligible to decide
where and how to invest their
retirement money.
Their options are:
- staying with the traditional plan
from the State Universities Retirement
System, with benefits at retirement
dependent on a formula based on age,
years of service and salary.
- enrolling in a “portable”

benefits package that will allow them
to take their retirement account with
them to another job or roll it over into
an IRA.
placing their money in one or
more of 40 types of investment
vehicles, including mutual funds and
money markets. That will give
employees a chance to make more
money than in the traditional plan, but
it will also open them up to the risk of
losing money.

Famous footage of Kennedy assassination goes on sale
DALLAS (AP) - 35 years ago, a
dressmaker with vertigo climbed
a wall so he could get a clear
vantage point to film President
Kennedy’s motorcade through
downtown Dallas.
When Abraham Zapruder
aimed the telephoto lens of his
Bell & Howell home movie
camera, he hoped to capture
something
to
show
his
grandchildren. Instead, he gave
the nation a visceral close-up of
one of its most horrific moments.
For years, conspiracy theorists
have played and replayed bootleg
copies of Zapruder’s 26-second
film of Kennedy’s assassination.
Starting this week, anyone
can buy a digitally enhanced
videotape for $19.98 at a video
store and watch the murder at
home. Some copies were shipped
Friday, but most go out today and
will be available across the
country by the end of the week,
Natalie Olinger, a spokeswoman
for MPI Home Video of Orland
Park, 111., which made the

video, said.
Some suggest Zapruder’s
family and the video producer are
trying to profit from the crime.
But the family wants the film to
be available to historians and
others who frequently request
access, and they also hope to
recoup the estimated $350,000
cost of enhancing and preserving
the film, James Silverberg, the
family attorney, said.
The 45-minute video, called
“Image of an Assassination: A
New Look at the Zapruder Film,”
consists of a 40-minute preamble
and six separate showings of
President
Kennedy’s
head
exploding when hit by a bullet.
If the comments of tourists
visiting Dallas’ Dealey Plaza on
Sunday is any indication, the
Zapruder film still provokes
strong reactions.
“I don’t think it should go on
sale, just out of respect and
consideration for (Kennedy’s)
family,”
Pamela
Tate
of
Glenwood Springs, Colo., said,

visiting the scene of the crime for
the first time. “It kind of
cheapens the situation.”
Dale Strickland of Los
Angeles, standing about 100
feet from where Kennedy was
shot, said the film should be
made public.
“I'm kind of surprised it’s
taken this long to become
available,” Strickland said. “I
don’t know that it really tells you
anything, but how can you
restrict something like that from
the public, with what we believe
about the dissemination of
information?”
After Zapruder made the
film on Nov. 22, 1963, Life
magazine bought rights to
the
footage
for
$50,000.
ABC’s “Goodnight America”
first showed the film on
television in 1975, and bootleg
copies have abounded.
The original copy of the film
sits in a gray, metal file cabinet at
the National Archives, in a room
kept at a frigid 25 degrees to

preserve it.
Last year, the federal
Assassination Records Review
Board declared that the American
public owns the film. The
government and the Zapruder
family are negotiating payment.
The government has offered $3
million, and the Zapruders have
asked for $18 million.
Robert Groden sells his own
assassination books and videos
from a spot near the infamous
Grassy Knoll, from where some
believe a second gunman
shot Kennedy. The official
explanation is that Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone, shooting the
president from the Texas School
Book Depository.
Groden, who previewed the
new video for Dealey Plaza
visitors on a television set atop a
garbage can, said the picture is
improved over earlier versions.
“The clarity
and
the
sharpness
are
absolutely
exquisite,” Groden said, just as
Kennedy’s skull was ripped open

by a rifle shot. A woman in the
crowd gasped and hurried away.
Despite
being
“gruesome,
shocking and vulgar,” it’s
probably the most important film
clip in the nation’s history,
Waleed Ali, executive producer
for MPI Home Video, said.
“Parents should be cautious
about showing it to children
under the age of 11 because it is
disturbing, but this needs to be
out in the hands of the people,”
he said.
Then again, the gore of the
Zapruder film still won’t rival the
violence of its Hollywood
competition.
“We
went
to
see
‘Armageddon’ last night, and
that was disgusting,” Becky
Schumacher, a nurse from
Buffalo, N.Y., said.
“I would watch it because I
was in the eighth grade when he
was killed,” she said. “It made
such a huge impact. The whole
country was afraid of what was
going to happen next.”

A definition of myself Letters to the editor
Danielle: the crybaby, the angry woman, the shell
Lately I’ve become ultra-sensitive. I cry at the
most mundane or contrite instances. I start to cry during
the sappiest scenes in a film or television show. I cry
during programs I normally never cry at, like when VH1 shows "The Jackson Family: An American Dream,”
arguably
one of the worst movies Angela Bassett has
Danielle
ever
been
in. I find myself crying, and I’ve seen that
Belton
movie at least five times and never cried once.
No, I am not pregnant. I’ve just become really sensitive as
of late.
I’ve always been this “all feeling” type of person. When I make
mistakes, I carry them with me for the rest of my life. I remember
things that I’ve done wrong since elementary school that I still feel
guilty about to this day. I’m extremely hard on myself when I think
I may have hurt someone. I never really forgive myself, in hopes that
carrying the guilt will remind me not to make the mistake again. My
anger works the same way. I carry it inside myself. I hardly ever
voice myself when I’m angry. Even in my dreams I appear to be able
to fight back or scream when I’m attacked or irritated. It’s like there
is both a barrier in reality and in my subconscious that keeps my
anger forever repressed.
Even when it’s obvious that I’m right, I sometimes second
guess myself. Writing has always been that outlet for me. When I get
upset, I write. That has been the only release that I’ve ever had. I’ve
kept a diary since the third grade. Writing was the only way I could
act out my fears and frustrations.
There have been so many times in my life that I’ve felt helpless,
or like I didn’t have a voice. I'd feel as if someone were standing
behind me, holding my arms behind my back. I wanted to release the
anger or pain like anyone else, but instead it stayed inside of me.
Forcing me to always be in a state of awkwardness.
It’s like when I was a child on the playground, and how I used
to always sit on the swing alone while everyone else ran around and
screamed to the top of their lungs and played. 1 remember my
classmate Tomma walking up to me and asking why I never
screamed. And I asked her why would I want to, why scream? What
was the purpose in it? And she told me because it was fun.
I didn’t want to scream then, but now sometimes all I want to
do is scream, because that’s how I feel sometimes. I feel trapped in
a persona I didn’t create, trapped in one that was molded for me over
time by my school and my peers. I was always Danielle, the calm
and rational nerd, and if I acted outside of those boundaries, people
thought I was crazy. And that fact remains to this day.
When I get angry, which doesn’t happen often, the person who
I am directing the anger towards never takes me seriously and never
sees the real reason, the always obvious reason why I am angry.
They always assume it’s PMS. And I won’t lie; PMS does affect my
mood. It makes me act out an anger I normally would never show.
But it’s because the person just treats me like I’m irrational or out of
my character, and the anger is never really released. Instead I feel
awful for losing my temper, and I curse myself.
My mother has a similar problem, so I guess it's either learned
behavior or genetic. That killer conscious I have, must be. It can't be
good to never let the frustration out, but I don’t. I don’t scream, and
I won’t let myself cry during all those sappy programs, no matter
how much I want to. Since elementary school I’ve been trying not to
be “weak,” as I was often called. Fourteen years later, I’m still trying
to resolve issues that happened in the third grade.
My emotions never allow me to forget how human I actually
am, no matter how much I wish they wouldn’t.

AIDS Awareness for
African-Americans
The euphoria that marked
the 11th World AIDS Conference
in 1996 was missing as
researchers gathered in Geneva
for the 12th international
meeting. This year, the focus
returned to the epidemic’s
relentless march.
The hope sparked two years
ago by protease inhibitors has
also dimmed. Two new drugs
reduce the number of pills that
must be taken daily. But the
drugs
are
expensive
for
developing countries, which
have 90 percent of HIV
infections.
Worst of all, some countries
still deny they have an
AIDS problem.
In America, denial remains
strong in the group hardest hit
today: African-Americans.
Surgeon General David
Satcher blames black ministers
and civil rights groups for not
speaking out more forcefully
about what is becoming “an
epidemic of color.”
Prevention — frank talk
about transmission — remains
the only sure way to avoid this
fatal
disease.
International
conferences can be of little
help if silence is allowed to fuel
its spread.

unwanted harassment.
It’s now up to public and
private employers, both large and
small, to evaluate their sexual
harassment training for new
and current employees. They
must let all workers know
what constitutes unacceptable
behavior. And they must commit
to promptly and thoroughly
investigate complaints
and
dealing
appropriately
with
harassers.

Happy Trails to You
Happy trails to Roy Rogers.
The world may be divided into
those who think Roy Rogers is a
restaurant and those who know
him as King of the Cowboys. The
differences in perception are not
just historical.
Rogers, who died Monday
at 86, epitomized the United
States in the 1950s, both on
the screen and in his personal
life. His America was a place
where the good guys always won
and the bad guys always lost, and
where “Happy Trails To You”
was a metaphor for how most
Americans expected to live
their lives.

Sexual Harassment and
the Supreme Court
Sexual
harassment
is
intolerable in the American
workplace.
The U.S. Supreme Court
made that clear in two recent
rulings.
But what exactly is sexual
harassment?
The court didn’t fully define
that. The uncertainty is an
additional reason why ongoing
training programs and fair
procedures
for
handling
complaints are so important for
supervisors and other employees.
Depending on what is said, a
compliment on one’s clothing
could be either appropriate and

Federally Funded Viagra
for All?
The federal “mandate”
issued late last week that would
force states to pay for Viagra for
Medicaid patients is mindless.
It also demonstrates Uncle Sam’s
untoward
lurch
into
the
boudoir, exposing states — and
taxpayer money — to indecent
possibilities for abuse.
The new law, directed by the
Clinton administration, requires
states to cover the prescription
drug when such coverage is
medically necessary. Viagra
costs $8 to $10 a pill. Medicaid,
the insurance program for the
poor and disabled, is paid for
with state and federal dollars.

the nation, should be outraged.
The federal government should
immediately
rescind
this
directive.
It hasn’t been made clear
if the drug is safe or necessary.
The potential for clinical and
financial abuse of Viagra — not
to mention the health danger
when it is taken by people on
certain medications — is such
that states deserve the option
to choose Medicaid coverage
of Viagra.
Covering Viagra will cost
state and federal agencies $100
million a year. Texas health
officials should join officials
from New York and Wisconsin
who have boldly said they won’t

Spiraling-Down Birth
Rates
With good reason, it has
long been an article of faith that a
high incidence of out-of-wedlock
births among black women is a
major cause of poverty among
black Americans.
Thus the recent report that
birth rates for unmarried women
in the U.S. are trending
downward — and dramatically
so for black women — is
good news.
A report recently issued by the
National Center for Health
Statistics indicates the incidence
of births for unmarried black
women under 30 is in
particularly steep decline.
Researchers
credit
the
increased use of contraceptives,
improved sex education —
including an emphasis on
abstinence — and the AIDS
epidemic
as
possible
explanations for the downturn in
this key social indicator.
This
is a
heartening
development. Regardless of race,
children born to unwed mothers
are at much higher risk of living
in poverty, becoming victims of
child abuse and getting involved
with crime.

I ’ll be the first to admit that I
want to be famous, to a certain
degree. That’s why I’ve gotten
into the communications field. I
figure it will give me more
outlets to find success in the
entertainment world.
Unfortunately, since it is
a field where appearance
matters, my options are
becoming limited.
You see, I’m a big guy,
always have been. And there’s a
sort of unwritten rule about big
people succeeding in the world
of entertainment: only one at a
time. That means I’ve got to waif
for someone to die of some
obesity-associated illness.
You don't believe me? Well
maybe this list will help prove
my point.
How many famous fat-guy
actors are alive right now? One,
John Goodman. And he’s from
St. Louis, a double whammy
for me.
What about chubby Burt
Reynold’s sidekicks? One, Dom
DeLouise. (But, he’s in my dead
pool for next year, so keep your
fingers crossed.)
Did I forget to mention portly
lead singers? Oh yes. The guy
from Smashmouth, who some
say I have a resemblance to,
but it’s not getting me any
record contracts.
A TV sitcom would be nice.
But oh, Drew Carrey’s already a
fat guy on TV. My bad.
So, my options are limited. I
may have a shot at becoming this
generation’s hilarious obese
comic who dies of a drug
overdose (i.e. John Belushi and
Chris Farley), but that doesn’t
sound too enticing.
So my options are either wait
around, or lose some weight.
Let’s see which happens first,
shall we?

got a few more wrinkles and gray hairs, but
the boys still have the skills to pay the bills.
The trio has better staying power than Viagra,
which is their most impressive attribute.
While most rap and hip hop groups from
the ‘80s have faded into oblivion, the Beasties
have stayed consistently popular. Their secret
is never having released a bad album.
1986’s “License to 111,” their frat-boy party
debut remains firmly in Billboard’s Top Pop
Catalog albums, while their other three studio
releases remain very popular sellers.

Who says you can’t
be equally annoying and
entertaining at the same time?
Tell that to Fred Schneider,
the perky,
flamboyantly
dressed co-lead singer for the
B-52’s. Schneider, along with
his cohorts, Kate Pierson,
Cindy Wilson and Keith
Strickland, rocked the house
at Riverport Ampitheatre last
Wednesday.
Twenty years ago, the
group from Athens, Ga.,
started
performing
their
quirky songs about lobster
attacks and planets named
after chicks and made waves
in the New York club scene.
With the girls’ bouffant
hairdos and Schneider’s odd
choices
for
musical
instruments (walkie talkies,
toy pianos), they paved the
way for the ‘80s new wave
movement and scored hits
with songs like “Private
Idaho” and “2% Girls.”
They suffered a setback in

1985 when original guitar
player, Ricky Wilson, died
from AIDS, but they had a
major comeback with 1989’s
“Cosmic Thing,” their biggest
commercial success to date.
Cindy Wilson left the
group, in the early ‘90s, but
has since rejoined for the
band’s 20th anniversary tour.
The foursome have not lost
a step in two decades and
performed to an energetic
house in St. Louis. Wilson
and Pierson harmonized
gorgeously on such favorites
as “Roam” and “Strobelight.”
And Schneider stayed
true to his quasi-freakish self,
with his nasally singing style
on “Planet Claire” and “Is
That You Mo-Dean?” and
plastic wardrobe.
Two new tracks were
played and appear on their
recent greatest hits CD called
“Time Capsule.” “Debbie,"
their single, was an ode
to “Blondie’s” frontwoman,
Debbie
Harry,
while
“Hallucinating Pluto” calls
back to their early outer space
inspired classics.

On campus, standards for rape differ from those in the “real world”
LEWISTON, Maine (AP) —
During his freshman year at
Bates College, a young man had
sex with at least three women:
teen-age sex that was awkward
and at times drunken. He never
thought it was a crime.
Now 19, he is learning the
hard way that what constitutes
rape at many of the nation’s
colleges and universities is far
different from what is prosecuted
in state courtrooms.
He was expelled, pending
appeal, and branded a rapist by
a college committee for conduct
that, his lawyer says, would
never have been prosecuted in the
“real world.”
“He’s pretty traumatized
and dumfounded,” says attorney
Julian Sweet. He insists his
client’s sexual activity was
consensual and no different
from encounters on many
other campuses.
In the spring, Sweet sought
an injunction in state court,

successfully modifying, but not
stopping, a hearing by the
college’s conduct committee.
And while those court documents
identify the student only as
“N.S.,” they do contain many
other details:
The student, whom the
college also hasn’t identified, had
sex twice last September with
a drunken freshman who
repeatedly shooed her roommate
out of their room so she could be
alone with him, according to state
court records.
After a December dance, his
partner was a senior he had slept
with before.
In February, he spent
the night in the room of
another freshman, who filed an
anonymous complaint right away
with the college. The following
month, she filed a formal
complaint against the young man.
Complaints from the other two
women followed. Whatever
happened in the room has not

been publicly documented.
John Cole, attorney for
the small private college,
acknowledges that the allegations
of rape, heard by the school’s
Student Conduct Committee,
might not hold up in court. But,
he says, they don’t need to.
“The college does not have
any obligation at all to set
standards the equivalent of
criminal law. Instead, it sets its
own standards,” Cole says. “It is
a phenomenon that is going on on
every campus in the country.”
Rosanne Yates of the Sexual
Assault Crisis Center in Lewiston
has a clear vision: as long as a
woman feels she has been
violated and raped, then she has.
But Sweet, calling rape a
serious
crime,
asks
that
charges be based on cold facts,
not perceptions.
Washington lawyer Terry
Pell says college women may be
unfairly protected in many cases.
“On
many
campuses,
women's advocacy groups have
pushed very hard for a certain
view of what the law and
standard of conduct should be.
And it is very one-sided and
extreme,” Pell, senior counsel at
the Center for Individual Rights,
a conservative public interest law
firm, says.
Neither such views nor such
allegations are likely to find
support in the larger society.
“The facts of these cases
don't support the charge of rape,”
Pell says, adding that such
allegations often prove to be
“incredibly murky.”
The FBI, often used as a
model for state law enforcement
officials, defines rape as “the
carnal knowledge of a female
forcibly and against her will.”
But Bates also says rape occurs
if a person cannot give consent

— if, for example, the victim
is asleep, unconscious or
substantially impaired by alcohol
or drugs.
“Bates has changed the
definition of consent,” Sweet
says. “That seems to be a huge
and dangerous step away from
the
standards
that
have
traditionally been applied to
adults, and these students claim
they want to be treated
like adults.”
None of the women accusing
the young man took their
allegations to police. Instead,
they relied on the Bates
committee, which includes both
students and faculty.
Complaints by the two
freshmen
resulted
in
his
expulsion, but he appealed the
decision and his case will be
heard by the Student Conduct
Committee again in September.
The senior filed the complaint
after the accused was allowed
to appeal.
Sweet is waiting to hear if
the college will throw out that
charge before they decide
whether to sue Bates for libel.
That’s what student Adam
Lack did earlier this year at
Brown University in Providence,
R.I., after he was punished for
allegedly raping another student.
Lack,
who
eventually
settled with the university,
claimed that the disciplinary
proceedings were flawed, partly
because
accusations
were
unsubstantiated.
The
mechanisms
for
handling campus crime have
come under increased scrutiny
because of cases like these.
“We don’t automatically
expel a student if they are
charged with something, because
they aren't always guilty,” Nestor
Gonzales,
spokesman
for

Oklahoma State University,
which has 19,350 students on its
Stillwater campus, says.
Many large universities
bypass student council courts,
which are common at smaller
colleges
such
as
Bates.
Rather, campus police handle
complaints, make arrests and
file
charges
through
the
district attorney.
Critics say student panels,
which
normally
handle
complaints
of
cheating,
plagiarism, behavior problems
and the like, often are not
qualified to hear serious crimes
like rape.
Why then do so many
colleges use them?
Partly because a federal law
encourages their use and offers
funding
that
no
college
administrator likes to lose, Gary
Pavela of the University of
Maryland at College Park, an
authority on student-conduct
courts, says.
Still, he warns: “You don’t
want college campuses to
become an enclave away from
the criminal justice system so that
the privileged can adjudicate
with their own system.”
At Bates, students are
divided on whether the Student
Conduct Committee is qualified
to deal with complaints like rape.
Shawn O’Leary, a student
who acted as an adviser to one of
the young man’s accusers,
defends the board. He says the
accused failed to meet the
standards of conduct set by the
school, and therefore the college
has the right to expel in order to
protect fellow students.
Senior Ruth Mills disagrees,
saying an allegation of rape is too
serious. “I think that belongs in a
court of law.”

donuts, just to name a few.
The disc starts off with a fast
and furious cut called “Super
Disco Breakin” and concludes
with a sly, slow track called
“Instant Death,” which is a cross
between lounge and dentist office
Muzack. In between are 20 tracks
of pure mayhem.
“The Move” is remniscient
of their second album “Paul’s
Boutique” and features a
renaissance style harpsichord,
R2-D2 samples, a Mexican

epilogue and rhymes like “I don’t
mean to brag, I don’t mean to
boast. But I’m intercontinental
when I eat french toast.”
Other highlights include a
Beck-influenced cut called “Song
for the Man” and their first
single, “Intergalactic” complete
with a robotic background. The
album provides enough new
sounds for their upcoming “In the
Round” tour which lands in St.
Louis on August 8. I”ve got
my tickets.

and Chicago State universities.
Some other school groups will
join the plan later this year.
Current employees have a
year to decide if they want to
change retirement plans, while
new employees will have 60 days
to choose a plan.
SURS expects about onethird of new employees to
manage their retirement account
themselves, a quarter to choose
the traditional option and the rest
the portable plan.
SURS expects most current
employees who have been at their
jobs for a while will stay away
from the self-managed plan,
because they would lose a large
amount of money in the transfer,
Beedie said.
One thing doesn’t change no
matter which plan an employee
chooses: they still have to
contribute about 8 percent of
their salaries to their retirement
account, and the state still
contributes matching money.
But with the traditional and

portable plans, how that money is
invested
is
decided
by
professional money managers
hired by the SURS board of
trustees. With the self-managed
plan, the employee decides how
much of their money is going to
be invested in accounts such as a
money market or growth stock.
Tom Koob is a vice
president at TIAA-CREF, one of
the three companies chosen to
offer investment vehicles for
employees
in
the
self­
managed plan.
He said giving employees
the option to make their own
investment choices is the norm at
public university systems in most
other states, so Illinois is just
catching up with the trend.
And the move will make
Illinois schools more competitive
when trying to attract faculty and
academics from other states
because many professors will
now be able to roll their
retirement funds from their old
schools into the Illinois system,
something not possible under the
traditional plan, Koob said.

Schmidt w onders if it will be his normally pleasant disposition.
The right-handed Schmidt started 8-1 and was the first NL
pitcher to win eight games, but has since lost four in a row over
his last seven starts. He pitched well enough to win several times,
but m ost of the losses were deserved; he gave up at least four
earned runs in four of his five starts leading up to the break.
“It’s discouraging,” Schmidt said. “Every tim e I pitch, it’s the

THE SHOW MUST NOT GO ON!

So when
you become
a Childreach
sponsor and
receive pictures
and letters that
speak o f hope, you’ll
know that you have helped to
make a real difference in
• the lives of a needy child,
family, and community

nfortunately for children
living in some of the poorest
countries in the world, it ^
takes more than fading
m
marks on a wall.
Childreach,
one of the oldest
and largest child
sponsorship
''' m * ¡I ^
organizations,
measures growth
by the number of
hospitals, wells
for clean
water, and
self-help
programs
we build
in partner­
ship with
the proud families and
communities where our
sponsored children live.
Childreach is not a
quick fix or a handout.
It is child sponsorship
at its best— a caring,
continuing relationship
that leads to measurable
progress over time.

U

Childreach.
It works.

Elephants in circuses are not trained with love and treats. They endure years of brutal
training. Is this entertainment? Circus Facts;
• Since 1983,21 people have been killed and 34 people seriously injured by
performing elephants.

Yes! I want to know more about Childreach.

M ost; incidents of elephant aggression have involved elephants which have

been routinely beaten throughout their lives.
Please help Kim Basinger and the Performing Animal Welfare Socicty put an end to
the use of elephants in circuses.
