MESA exposes students to science’s possibilities
By David Weil
News Reporter
On Saturday, Feb. 10, junior high students from Alton will
becom e the second group of students to take part in the Midwest
Engineering and Science Association (M E SA ) Pre-College
Program. The program was inaugurated in the fall by Ron
Banks, assistant to the dean of the S IU E School o f Engineering.
The goal o f the program is to expose junior high students to
the many exciting possibilities of science. In order to accomplish
this goal, students must gain vital hands-on experience.
“ We transport the students to the SIU E main campus, and we
spend Saturday doing hands-on scientific activities,” Banks said.
The program was initiated in the fall, with over 30 students
from Lansdowne, Martin Luther King, Clark and HughesQuinn-Rock junior high schools in East St. Louis participating.
Students applied for participation in the program through their
individual counseling offices, and those applications were then
sent to B anks and other faculty participants.
“ We came up with a really diverse group of students, students
who really wanted to give up their Saturday mornings for this
program ,” Banks said.
Banks said he hopes to increase the level of interest young

students have in the field of science. B y taking advantage of
access to new and exciting technology such as the Internet,
students can learn to enjoy learning.
“ We have our faculty tnembers work with students and they
have a great time while learning about science and engineering,”
Banks said.
Banks, director o f the school’s Minority Engineering
Program, said he sees the value of reaching students who would
otherwise receive little exposure to the types of instruction
found in the science and engineering program.
“ In order for us to increase (the number of) minority students
in the study o f science, we have to expose them to these kinds of
activities at this age to help m ake an impression so they can
m ake decisions about the future,” B anks said.
“ This way, we can build a pool of students who will become
interested in science at the junior high level, and then they can
m ake curriculum decisions in high school that will help them in
their college plans.”
Thus far, the program has been effective in luring students
away from their usual Saturday morning routines, as evidenced
by a 65 percent fall attendance rate.
Banks said he believes the program has been a success in

Gov. Jim E d gar’s influence on an Internet project, which
puts technology and manufacturing modernization resources
literally at the fingertips of Illinois businesses, has recently
drawn high commendations from the Illinois Coalition, a non­
profit, non-partisan organization that focuses on enforcing the
state’s economy through science and technology.
Project C O M P E T E , as it is called, will bridge the gap
between present-day training options and more m odern, up-todate training availability through the use o f Internet Web sites.
Thomas V. Thornton, president o f the Illinois Coalition,
gave his thoughts on the project in a recent telephone
interview.
“ C O M PET E will be good at updating w orkplace skills,”
Thornton said.
“The Web is a constant update o f training and information
... the developm ent o f a Web site will provide access to what
they (workers) want ... it will give them the opportunity they
need to be com petitive, establish a com petitive price, lower
production costs, reduce environm ental w aste, keep em ployees
informed and develop new product lines.”
Thornton w ent on to say that Web sites can be updated at
any time, unlike other training m aterials that endure longer
publication or incorporation processes.
“ Virtual reality offers a greater amount o f functionality than
reality,” Thornton said.
S IU E will be the hom e o f the Southern Illinois
Manufacturing Technology Extension Center, one o f seven
regional manufacturing extension centers that will essentially
teach m anufacturers how to use the C O M P E T E system and
will have a format similar to that o f agricultural extension
centers.

Residents oppose new police station at expense of historic homes
• Collinsville city leaders may alter plans for a new police station site
after hearing from residents who oppose tearing down two historic
homes. About 45 people packed the City Council chambers Monday
night, with a handful criticizing the city for considering destroying the
Kennedy home and Beidler Hotel, both on East Church Street.
“ I don’t know why the police station cannot coexist with the two

Bomb destroys a U.S. military training facility
• For thousands of Americans living in Saudi Arabia, the kingdom
seemed one of the few havens in the Middle East, a region plagued by
terrorism. That sense of security vanished Monday when a bomb
destroyed a U.S.-run military training facility, killing five Americans
and a Filipino and injuring 60 people. On Tuesday, a seventh person
died from injuries suffered in the bombing, according to U.S. Defense
Department spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Scott Campbell. Six Americans
remain in critical condition at hospitals in Riyadh. Despite three claims
of responsibility, it is still not clear who carried out the attack. It is also
not known whether it was an isolated incident or part of a wider
campaign against the ruling al-Saud family and the Americans who
work for them.

O ver the summer, many changes took place concerning parking that
came as a surprise to some returning and new students and staff. Not to
mention the price o f parking decals going up, L o t 12, which was once a
free lot, becam e a regular decal-required parking lot. These changes
caused many students, faculty and staff to wonder why we have to pay for
these changes in higher parking decal fees.
A s reported by R obert Vanzo, director o f Adm inistrative Services,
there have been many misconceptions concerning who takes care of the
costs for maintenance on the parking lots, installation o f the new
em ergency telephones and the outside lighting. To set the record straight,
the university is responsible for generating all revenue for these repairs
and new equipm ent. The university does not receive any type of state
appropriation for parking as many may have assumed.
A large-scale project is in the works to upgrade parking lots, to install
more em ergency telephones, to add an additional parking facility on the
west end o f campus and to increase lighting around campus.
Vanzo states that people often request changes on campus concerning
these and other issues. He simply replies, “ If we want enhancements, we
must unfortunately be willing to help pay for them .”
A s parts o f this university community, we all need to join together to
m ake this a better place to learn and a b etter place for current and future
students and staff.

Dr. King deserves right to a holiday more than Abe Lincoln
It was rather unfortunate to witness the high
level o f ignorance flaunted by the young man who
wrote the “ Abraham Lincoln deserves holiday just
like Dr. K ing” article. You would think on a college
campus this type of ignorance would be monitored
and amended.
I, for one, was quite thankful for the Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday. It is not often that one can
refrain from the “ M aster’s ” task, w ithout the
commemoration of a thief, exploiter and invader
such as Christopher Columbus. I hope the day was
not totally wasted by the young man, because there
is a lot of U .S. History he needs to be familiarizing
himself with.
For starters, he can begin by reading the speech
given by Lincoln at Peoria, 111., on Oct. 16, 1854.
M aybe this will enable him to distinguish the
difference betw een giving a man freedom and
equality, or sim ply allow ing him to leav e a
plantation. Just because a person is no longer on a
plantation, does not indicate that person is free.
Therefore, it’s very misleading for the young man to
proclaim in his letter “ Lincoln was responsible for
freeing the slaves 100 years before K ing’s ‘I H ave a
D ream ’ speech.” A few quotes from Lincoln’s
speeches will further give evidence o f my point.
Lincoln said in his speech at Peoria, “ W hat next?
Free them, and m ake them, politically and socially,
our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this;
and if mine would, we well know that those o f the
great mass of white people will not.” In short,
Lincoln is saying, ‘Just because I plan to free the
slaves, does not mean I intend for them to have
equality. T hey w ill rem ain a p eop le o f sm all
im portance, subservient and inferior to white
authority.’
Lincoln freed blacks in the sam e manner you
would free an animal. In freeing an animal such as
a horse, you would relinquish it o f its duties, like
pulling a plow, etc. You would then allow the horse
to leave the closed-in property and let it roam freely
in the wild. This is exactly what Lincoln did. Not
once did he bring to question equality, human and
civil rights. Lincoln openly admitted these were
never his intentions. This is why there was such a
dire need for King to come along and attach civil
and human rights to the worthless freedom Lincoln
gave.
W hat do you think the Em ancipation
Proclamation meant to black people before the
King era? How could black people even imagine
they w ere free when they could n’t even do
something as natural as release their bowels in a
white restroom without fear of their skull being
fractured?

L et us not for a moment think that Lincoln lost
sleep worrying about the cruel treatm ent o f slaves.
Lincoln’s decision to abolish slavery was prompted
by the fragm ented condition of the Union. Saving
the Union was Lincoln’s only ambition. H e stated
this in his Proclamation o f Em ancipation speech on
Jan. 28,1863.
“ I am not, nor ever have been, a fanatic against
slavery as a dom estic institution, nor have I ever
been connected for an hour with any party or
association, which struck at slavery in that
character.” Lincoln goes on to say, “ When I strike at
slavery, it is because slavery strikes at my country,
and for that I would strike it down.”
G iven this inform ation, it would be rather
contradictory to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday. He
freed slaves, but denied them equality. If you don’t
have equality, you’re a second class citizen. If you’re
a second class citizen, you’re not free. If you’re not
free, yo u ’re a slave. So what did Lincoln do
concerning slavery? Virtually nothing.
This is why for the past year King has been

I am writing in response to Christopher L.
Clayton’s editorial, which was seen in the Tuesday,
Jan. 23 edition o f the A lestle.
In his article, Clayton suggests that we should
honor Abraham Lincoln because he freed the
slaves. Clayton also gives the notion that Lincoln
deserves to be honored more so than Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., because he “ started 100 years
earlier.”
First of all, I’m not discussing w hether or not
King should be celebrated. My claim, and sole
purpose for this letter, is to suggest that Lincoln
should not be honored.
U nderstand that I disagree with Clayton’s claim
that Lincoln freed the slaves (if you believe they
are free). I will credit Lincoln with signing the
Em ancipation Proclam ation; however, Lincoln’s
motives w ere not to free slaves, nor did he seem to
believe them to be his equal. Lincoln was very
willing to let slavery exist. This can be seen by
examining the Em ancipation Proclamation.
The Em ancipation Proclam ation only applied to
states o f the Confederacy, not the the Union. That
meant the slaves in the Union were not freed until
later. So, as you can see, this was not an
abolishm ent of slavery.
Furtherm ore, the Proclamation was signed in
January o f 1863, but did not go into effect until the
end of the year. Lincoln was in no rush for freedom
for all. Som ething even more interesting is that if
the Confederate states had re-joined the Union

recognized for the freedom o f blacks, and not
Lincoln. You would think that the young man
would have no problem celebrating K ing’s birthday;
after all, wasn’t King the preferable, passive, loving
“ N egro” ?
A word to the wise for the young man who wrote
the article: “ It is better to be quiet and have people
assume you are ignorant than to open your mouth
and unknowingling confirm it.”
If, for some, reason, the curriculum at S IU E has
not been constructed to facilitate your learning in
certain areas, I would be happy to school you in my
spare time.
For the people who continue to be deceived by
anim ated Am erican H eroes, M alcolm X warned us
about them. He said, “ A man who tosses worms in
the river isn’t necessarily a friend o f the fish. A ll the
fish who take him for a friend, and think the worms
have no hooks in them, usually end up in the frying
pan.”
Anthony Smith
Junior
before the end of the war, then they would have
been able to keep their slaves. You see, Lincoln
was not interested in the slaves’ w elfare, he was
interested in maintaining the Union and keeping
the country together.
A nother reason for the Proclam ation was to
k eep E u ro p e out o f the war. With the
Proclam ation, the Union looked morally right and
the Confederates looked morally wrong. Europe
was interested in the w ar because they w ere
trading goods with the South and w ere possibly
going to help them. The Union had to stop this and
morality was the key.
A nother note is that Lincoln was also credited
with mentioning in his campaigns that he did not
see B lacks as his equals. He took a strong stand on
this despite claims that he him self had a Black
heritage. A s a m atter o f fact, Lincoln was call ed
“ A braham A fricanus the First” because of his
wooly hair and dark complexion. You see, there is
a lot to be learned about Lincoln. In all fairness,
Lincoln was not pro-slavery; however, I don’t see
Lincoln as deserving to be honored.
One last note is that I don’t understand why
Clayton says that Lincoln is “overlooked.” Besides
the point that Lincoln is glam orously celebrated in
school books, there is a holiday named after him. I
think Lincoln is being honored when he shouldn’t
be.

letter to the editor_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Your mother doesn't live here, so pick up after yourself
I find it utterly appalling that so many students at
SIU E have so much disrespect for their university.
Trash, such as em pty soda cans and potato chip
bags, litters the lawn and w alkways; however, with
the recent inclem ent w eather, my concern has
travelled indoors. M ost notably, the U niversity
Center has fallen prey to uncaring students.
During the Christmas break, U C managem ent
paid $20,000 to have the furniture in the Goshen
Lounge updated from its 1960s m otif to a more
modern color schem e. Tables w ere resurfaced using
a high-grade m aterial, and chairs and couches were
re-upholstered for the first time since 1967, from
orange to wine. A lso, the $20,000 allotted for this
project was only for the small number o f furniture
pieces in the G oshen Lounge; a total of $77,000 will
eventually be paid out to re-upholster and refinish

all 113 pieces of furniture used publically in the UC.
Now, only two w eeks after the initial stage o f the
project has been com pleted, students blatantly
disregard the signs requesting no food or drink
consumption in the Goshen Lounge. Two Weeks!
What has been the result? Already, an unrem ovable
soda stain has been detected. Not only are the signs
disregarded, but increased num bers o f trash
receptacles are also ignored. A s a result, crumpled
balls of wrappers, as well as half-empty and fully
consumed cans and bottles, lie on the floor and
tables.
What is so difficult about properly disposing of
your trash? Why can we not show a little more care
to ensure the lasting attractiveness of our “new ”
furniture? If you were at home, would you just toss

a wrapper on the living room floor because you w ere
too busy watching television and then just leave it
there when the show had ended? Probably not. And
yet, some people do in the midst of a conversation
here on campus.
You are paying for these services and deserve to
have them continue looking attractive. A lso, this is
home to many students living in Tower L ak e and the
R esidence Hall. If you cannot treat it as your home,
then, please, try to give it the respect o f someone
else’s home in which you are visiting.
This has been the opinion o f one University
C enter Board and Student Senate member.

SIUE starts Primary Care Nurse Practitioner program
By David Weil
News Reporter
Beginning in the fall o f 1996, graduates of the National League of Nursingaccredited baccalaureate programs will be able to further their education at
SIU E in the Primary C are Nurse Practitioner program. Upon completion of the
program, graduates will becom e eligible for certification by their specialization's
examination board.
The need for primary care nurses is on the rise throughout the country.
“The need arose because o f the need for health care in rural areas (where
there has been a lack o f practicing physicians),” D ean Felissa Cohen, of the
School of Nursing, said.
G raduates will also be prepared to provide health services in a variety of
settings. Urban and suburban areas also face rising needs for primary health care
providers.
G raduates o f the program, according to Cohen, will “ be able to handle

UNIVERSITY CEN TER B O A R D

chronic health problems that don’t necessitate a physician's care.”
Advanced practice nurses would work under the supervision o f a physician
in a variety o f settings. Clinics around the area, such as the community nursing
service unit at the E ast St. Louis Center, utilize nurses as prim ary care givers
under the direction of a qualified physician.
The new program will consist o f a 50-semester hour curriculum. In addition
to courses in statistics, advanced clinical assessm ent, nursing theory, physiology,
pharm acology and research, students will be required to com plete a minimum o f
500 hours of approved clinical participation. Clinical experience must m eet
guidelines presented by the National Organization o f Nurse Practitioner
Faculties.
A pproxim ately $350,000 in new state resources have been earm arked for
program funding. M oney will be allocated for the hiring of new faculty, as well
as the purchase of new equipm ent necessary for the program. A lso included will
b e additional staff at the community nursing service unit at the E ast St. Louis
Center.

Researcher analyzing enzyme that provides AIDS cell entry
L A S C R U C ES (AP)— New Mexico State University
biochemists are tracking an enzyme— integrase— that
helps A ID S penetrate human cells, where the virus then
uses the host’s own genetic mechanisms to replicate
itself.
The human immunodeficiency virus, which causes
A ID S, could be compared to a hacker breaking into
somebody’s computer and using the computer to copy
the hacker’s software over and over. This uncontrolled
malfunction causes the failure of the system— in this
case, the body’s immune system.
If scientists can learn how the protein integrase helps
HIV break into a normal cell’s genetics, then they may
be able to prevent that chemical process, says Colleen
Jonsson, who heads a four-member research team at
NMSU.
“This protein is involved in finding the key— this is sort
of the key to get to the door,” Jonsson says.
Jonsson, 36, has had integrase under surveillance for
five years. With $53,000 in research grants, she is
preparing a paper to be published this year on how
integrase operates within other viruses as well. Those
include MLV, which causes leukemia in mice; HTLV1,
which causes leukemia in humans; and HTLV2, which
causes no known disease, she says.
“We have right now in our lab all four o f those
(integrase) enzymes, MLV, HIV, HTLV1 and HTLV2.

the D N A, the chemistry of it, then we can start blocking
that chemistry.”
That moment of contact between the LTR and
integrase could be the weak link.
“ You could either target the part of the integrase that
is doing the recognition or you could target the part of
the LTR that’s required in the recognition,” Jonsson
says.
Once HIV gets inside the human cell, it becomes a
stable component of the human host’s cellular genetics.
“ Once it’s a part of your stable genome, then it
doesn’t have to worry about maintaining a copy of itself
outside the genome, which is very difficult.”
It’s living off the human host.
“ So now, your synthesis machinery will just be busy
making copies of the virus,” Jonsson says.
Jonsson, who earned her Ph.D. at Purdue, comes
from a medical family. Her father, Valgard Jonsson, was
laboratory director for the Department of Health
Services and Hospitals for the city of St. Louis until May
1994.
More and more, his daughter feels she is following in
his footsteps.
“ In the past year, I’m becoming more active with the
public health community down here. I’ve been doing a
project with hantavirus serum work, so I’ve been going
out into the community and talking to people and doing
more public health actual work,” she says.
“It floored me when I realized how excited I was
about doing something that was
very related to what my dad did.
I’m just evolving into this pattern,
like maybe it was there for me all
along.”
Ironically, she might have

so much. One of my best friends is
a sculptor. I did a lot of drawing
and silk screen. I’ve just started
painting. It helps me a lot to do
the art. It releases a lot.”

But when you’re doing art, you’re
sort of ‘in there’ with it. You’re

two.”

My strategy is to look at the integrase activity of all four
enzymes so that we can understand how this works in a
very specific, detailed way.”
The virus is a strand with chemically active tips at
either end called LTRs, for “long terminal repeats.”
Jonsson says integrase inserts these tip-ends into
human DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) inside the cell,
where the virus begins to replicate itself, using the host
cell machinery.
Once inside, another enzyme called reverse
transcriptase, or RT, allows that replication.
“RT takes the virus R N A genome and makes it into
a virus DNA genom e... compatible with your DNA. It’s
actually making a copy,” says Jonsson.
The integrase helps integrate the virus’ DNA copy
with the human DNA.
Once the virus D N A is in the host cell’s D N A, then
endless multiple copies theoretically can be made—
perhaps hundreds a day.
The drug AZT, which has been used against AID S,
seems to inhibit this replication process, Jonsson says,
but it has no effect on integrase.
Jonsson’s team is hoping to find a weakness in the
enzyme’s relationship with the LTR tips.
“ We want to understand exactly how integrase
recognizes the LTR,” she says. “If we can understand
how it recognizes its LTR, then w e’ve got it. Because if
we know what the interaction is between integrase and

'From Dusk Till Dawn' plot not up to speed with acting
By Lenon M aguire
Lifestyle Reporter
Quentin Tarantino and George
Clooney are criminals on the run who kid­
nap a family to get across the border in
the new film “From Dusk Till Dawn.”
Once in Mexico, they go to a bar that
opens in the evening and closes at sunrise,
hence the title. They later find out that all
the workers in the bar are vampires, and
try to escape. That’s it. That’s the plot.
This is the latest Tarantino script to hit
the screen. Tarantino does not, however,
direct this gory, bullet-ridden, high body
count action picture. The man behind this
one is Robert Rodriquez, best known for
his shoot ‘em up pictures “ El Mariachi”
and “ Desperado” (which comes to video
in early February).
“ From Dusk Till Dawn” is shot with an
over-the-top, comedic feel similar to
Rodriquez’s other two pictures, making it
a perfect candidate for a second feature at
the drive-in this summer. Even with all its
big names and special effects, this show is
never as good as it could be.
The movie starts with a scene in a
small convenience store where the Gecko
brothers (Tarantino and Clooney) get into
an argument with the locals and, in true
Tarantino fashion, kill everyone they can.
They then hop in a Winnebago with the
Fuller family, which includes Harvey
Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu, to
get past the border patrol. Once in

George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino shoot 'em up in "From Dusk Till Daw n"

Mexico, the Geckos are supposed to wait
for their connection at a bar called the
Titty Twister. (I won’t even describe the
neon sign).
Once inside, women are dancing top­
less on every other table, supporting the
lack o f taste displayed by the name o f the
bar. After a few drinks, the Gecko boys
start shooting again. Once the commotion
dies down, the workers in the bar, includ­
ing the band, turn into creatures o f the

night and try to feed on the customers.
Now the criminals and the hostages have
to band together in an attempt to make it
out alive.
Tarantino’s script was written very
early in his career. Special effects man
Robert
Kurtzman
commissioned
Tarantino to turn his story into a screen­
play that would display his special effects.
Part o f the deal was that Kurtzman would
do all the special effects work on

“Reservoir Dogs” for free.
To get Rodriquez, Tarantino rewrote
the script for him. The main flaw is the
absence o f the clever, intriguing dialogue
that made his other movies great. Even
with a rewrite, there are no remarks that
will be remembered like the waitress
speech or the royale with cheese speech
that made Tarantino’s other scripts great.
As far as acting goes, there were solid
performances. Even Tarantino does a
decent job. Clooney plays a tough guy
very well and is quite convincing. His
presence on the screen is one o f the high­
lights o f the picture. It does, however,
take a while to get used to him spewing
forth profanities in every sentence.
This collaboration between Rodriquez
and Tarantino had great promise. (The
two met at the Toronto Film Festival in
1992 where their films “Reservoir Dogs”
and “ El Mariachi” debuted.) For the most
part, however, it has produced a run-ofthe-mill action picture with some decent
special effects combined with good cam­
era angles and tracking shots. The prob­
lem is that with two o f the best people
working in films today, this movie should
offer more.
If you are dying to see this movie, go
to a rush hour show because you might be
disappointed paying six bucks or more. If
you can hold out another month or two,
wait until it coipes to the Cottonwood,
because it is worth their price o f admis­
sion.

Various styles are collaborated in 'The Rebirth of Cool Volume 3'
By Lenon M aguire
Lifestyle Reporter
In my last review, I mentioned that compilation albums are very abundant. To prove
my point, I am going to review another this week. The last album was dedicated to kids
shows, while this one is dedicated to a certain style. The problem is that there is no way
to categorize the music on this album, even though the songs are musically similar.
The title o f the album is The Rebirth o f Cool Volume 3: Subterranean Abstract
Blues, and it features Tricky, Portishead, the Beastie Boys, and others. It would be
wrong to call this a trip-hop album. Trip-hop is, however, on this album, along with
blues, acid jazz, and retro-sixties guitar rock. It also contains car alarms, sledge ham­
mers, police sirens and other samples o f every day sounds. All o f these are hidden
between the soundtrack music, industrial noise, post-rave beats, and pseudo-easy lis­
tening. While Moby produces all o f these things at blistering speed, Rebirth o f Cool
produces sounds at a more laid-back pace, allowing the listener to sit back and groove.
Each track on the album compliments the preceding track very well. The songs
almost seem to blend together in a mix o f samples, noise, and static.
The album starts o ff with “ Friendly Pressure” by Jhelisa, which immediately sets
the stage for the rest o f the album. The song begins with a quiet, melodic guitar solo
before bursting into a mix o f 303 bassline thuds, drum beats, and samples.
The Portishead song is titled “ Revenge o f the Number.” Beth Gibbons’ voice comes
through with chilling clarity to reach out and haunt the listener. Anyone who knows
Portishead knows that their re-mixes get new titles because they become new songs.
This one is not available on the domestic single. I’m not sure about import.
Tricky contributes with “ Hell is Round the Comer,” featuring a sample o f “ Ike’s Rap
11” by Isaac Hayes, which was also featured on the Portishead album Dummy. They’re
both from the same town, so it makes sense they would use the same sample. Between
the sample and the bass is the constant sound o f static which adds greatly to the dark
mood o f the song.
Bomb the Base has the second best line on the album in their song “ Bug Powder
Dust (LA Funk Mob Remix).” Upbeat lyrics in this song, such as “ I got a vegemite
sandwich from Men at Work,” contrast the dark mood o f some o f the other songs very
well. Good stuff.

The album ends with “Get It Together” by the Beastie Boys featuring Q-Tip. You
can get the song on the 111 Communication album, but I was still glad to hear it here
because it has one o f my favorite lines in the past couple o f years: “Ad Rock is down
with the lone/... /She’s the cheese and I’m the macaroni.” That,my friends, is true love.
If anyone ever said that to me, I would melt. More people should write lines like that.
The world would be a much more romantic place.
This is a solid album full o f musical surprises. A fan o f modem sampling machine
music should enjoy this one. If you like Portishead and Tricky, or wish Moby would
record his next album on valium, this album is for you. The laid-back sound is perfect
for relaxing alone or hanging with friends in the dorm room. If your friends do come
over, be careful because they might want to take the CD when they leave. It’s a good
one. It’s hip. It’s happening. And best o f all, it’s cool.

Duckey not all he was Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt go
‘quacked’ up to be at
bananas in y12 Monkeys'
UCB Comedy Jam
By Darryl Howlett
Lifestyle Reporter

j

On Saturday night, three com edians set out to tickle the
funnybones o f S IU E students. A s part o f the U C B Comedy
Jam, M elanie Comarcho, G uy T. and Shuckey D uckey each had
their moments.
G uy T., who served as m aster o f ceremonies, did a terrific job
of keeping the flow of the com edy show going. His urban, inyour-face style of humor kept the audience in laughter. I loved
it when he talked about the university putting him in the only
hotel in Edw ardsville— the Comfort Inn. Joe Torry (Guy T.’s
brother) must be proud to have another family m em ber who
happens to be funny. Look for Guy T. in bigger and better things
in the future. H e clearly was the best comedian of the night.
Comarcho, I must admit, held her own on the stage. She
talked about the ways o f men like there was no tomorrow. If I
didn’t agree with her, I probably would have been upset;
however, how can you get upset about men being dogs or men
using that M agic S h a v e ® stinky stuff? Seriously, I was quite
impressed by Comarcho and hope to see her on the comedy
circuit soon.
The last comedian o f the evening was none other than
Shuckey D uckey himself. Unfortunately, this main attraction’s
comedy never went farther than his opening “ shuckey duckey
quack, quack” routine. The rest of his m aterial was long and
minimally funny at best. He reminded me of B ill Cosby.
H owever, at least C osby’s punchline after a long dialogue is
worth the wait.
Som e m embers o f the audience were not pleased with
D uckey’s perform ance and becam e vocal about it. D uckey held
his own long enough to finish his perform ance, then G uy T. took
over the show, defending Duckey. G uy T. brought two men up
on-stage and literally em barrassed them to the max. The best
those guys could do was talk about G uy T.’s mother.
O verall, the show was entertaining. I enjoyed myself, but if
not for Torry and Comarcho, shouts o f “ we want our money
back” would have undoubtedly been heard.

From the rusting, crowded underground dwelling to the cold, top-side scenery with a dirty sky, it

is great as the unstable fanatic Jeffrey. Willis, however, does the best job. I liked his “ D ie H ard”
action-hero stints, but he wisely puts the tough guy on the back burner and convincingly plays a
man who questions his own sanity. In a great plot twist, Willis believes he is m entally unstable,
and Stowe thinks he’s a time traveler sent to save the world.
That is only one o f the clever twists in the film. Gilliam should be credited with making this an
intelligent, involving picture. A fter all, with another director, it could have easily ended up as scifi garbage. Slick look, explosions, overindulged special effects, over the top acting: I can see the

Lady Cougars unable to dent Knights’
armor-bounce back to outclaw Panthers
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter
Last week the S IU E Lady Cougars Basketball
team split their two gam es at the Vadalabene
Center.
On Thursday the Cougars lost to Bellarm ine,
who are tied for first in the G reat L akes Valley
Conference, by a score of 82-70. On Saturday
they bounced back to defeat Kentucky W esleyan
71-61 in another G LV C game.
The Lady Cougars are sitting with a 12-5
record overall and 7-4 in the conference.
Thursday’s contest showed why Bellarm ine is
one of the best team s in the conference. The Lady
Knights started out quickly, scoring 12 of the first
14 points, and led by nine at the half.
The Cougars started to execute in the paint in the
second half after head coach Wendy H edberg
instructed her team to take care o f the ball and
look for good shots.
Senior guard Terri Evans led all scorers with
18 points, even though she sat out a portion of the
second half with an injury.
Alicia Harkins and Am y Tuetken contributed 13
points each to the Cougar attack while B eth
Brown was an inside force with 12. Sophomore
Leslie Phillips rounded out the group of five
Lady Cougars in double figures, finishing with 11.

“ I’m happy with our perform ance,” H edberg
said. “ We made a couple of critical m istakes down
the stretch. They fouled us, so we were able to
stop the clock, but we missed free throws that we
had to m ake.”
On Saturday, the Cougars forgot about their
Thursday loss and outclawed the Panthers of
K entucky Wesleyan by ten.
The Cougars started out slowly, letting the 4-14
Panthers tie the game midway through the first
half, but the halftim e advantage went to the Lady
Cougars 32-27.
In the second half, K entucky W esleyan would
not die. S IU E held a 48-47 point lead with just
over nine m inutes rem aining. Scoring seven
unanswered baskets, the Cougars pulled away to
victory.
Evans threw in a game-high 22 points, while
grabbing five rebounds. Freshman Kim Low e and
Tuetken each added 11 points.
The Lady Cougars will hit the road next week
to face IU P U -F t. W ayne on Thursday and
Indianapolis on Saturday.
Because Ft. Wayne is tied with Bellarm ine for
first in the conference and Indianapolis is close
behind SIU E , H edberg said she believes there is
a lot riding on the upcoming week.
“This w eek could be the turning point of the
Jerem y Paschall/A /esf/e
season,” she said. “ We will be a definite underdog Freshman guard Heather W ilson looks for a teammate
against Fort Wayne, and we always have trouble during a recent game at the Vadalabene Center.

Jack Margenthaler
presents John Pruett with
an award in front of a
standing ovation at the
Vadalabene Center
Saturday night. Pruett was
honored for leading the
nation in field goal
percentage last season.
Pruett was lost for this
season due to an
automobile accident.
Right: Pruett in action last
season for the Cougars.
The undersized center, shot
71.5 percent from the field
to lead the nation.

The SIU E m en’s basketball
team is very good at keeping
fans entertained all the way
until the final buzzer, but now
the Cougars must figure out
how to win more o f the tight
games.
A fter losing a tough double
overtim e to Quincy, the men
came into last week looking
for a couple wins. Once again
the gam es w ere tight and
hard-fought, but the Cougars
could only pull out a victory in
one of the contests.
On Thursday, the Cougars
d efeated
a
scrappy
Bellarm ine team 74-68 before
falling Saturday night, in front
o f a large crowd at the
V adalabene Center, 95-91 to
K entucky Wesleyan.
In the B ellarm in e gam e,
the C ougars and Knights
battled back and forth for the
entire first half with neither
team going in front by more
than three points at any time.
The Cougars w ere able to
take a 34-31 lead into the
locker room at halftime.
The Cougars were helped
when B ellarm in e’s Steve
M ercer, the leading scorer in
the G LVC, had to be taken to
the hospital to have a cut
stitched after he bum ped
heads with Jason H olmes just
a few minutes into the game.
M ercer returned later in the
gam e, but never got on track
as he finished with seven
points in 11 minutes.

With the 6-7 M ercer out of
the game, S IU E looked to go
inside and senior cen ter
Ronnie Henderson was there
to respond.
Henderson was the gam e’s
high scorer with 23 points
w hile also grabbing nine
rebounds.
N athan K reke also took
advantage o f the lack o f inside
strength for the Knights. He
finished with a game high 12
rebounds and chipped in with
14 points.
Holmes rounded out a trio
o f Cougars in double figures,
tallying 16.
On Saturday, the gam e got
o ff to an em otional start as
last year’s starting center John
Pruett, who was lost for this
season due to injuries suffered
in an autom obile accident,
was at the Vadalabene Center.
B efo re the gam e, Pruett
accepted a plaque in honor of
his leading the nation in field
goal percentage last season.
With the team charged up
from having their team m ate
back on the bench, the
Cougars got off to a quick
start.
K reke led the S IU E charge
scoring 10 early points before
picking up two fouls that
placed him on the bench for
much o f the first half.
“ N athan cam e out with
desire and em otion,” H ead
coach Jack M argenthaler said
after the game. “ But the two
early
fouls
killed
the
momentum .”

Even with the foul trouble,
the Cougars stayed in control
for m ost o f the half, but
M argenthaler said he thought
it started slipping away with
around two minutes left in the
half.
In the second h a lt the foul
trouble caught up with the
team .
“ We had to start a different
line-up in the second h alf
because of the foul trouble
and by the end o f the game,
everyone on the court was in
foul trouble,” M argenthaler
said.
The foul trouble he talked
about eventually led to three
Cougars fouling out of the
gam e and two others finishing
with four fouls apiece.
With all the fouls called, it
was just up to the Panthers to
m ake free throws and down
the stretch they were able to
do just that to seal the fourpoint victory.
H olm es led the Cougars
with 18 points and K reke
finished with 16. Henderson
and Chris. Harris each chipped
in with 15 points.
E v en though they lost,
M argenthaler was able to find
some positive things to take
aw ay from the game.
“This was our third straight
gam e shooting at least 50
percent,” he said. “ Our shot
selection has been much
better and that’s something
we need to continue.”

“ M aking a Splash in the G reat L akes Valley Conference” was the theme o f the m edia guide
for the Southern Illinois University at Edw ardsville wom en’s soccer team and the women
kickers led the wave o f Cougar student-athletes on the 1995 fall Academ ic All-conference
team.
On the Academ ic A ll-G LV C team , S IU E wom en’s soccer featured eight players, including
four athletes who are repeat perform ers on the list. The Cougars’ volleyball squad had five
players selected to the team. Women’s tennis and m en’s cross country rounded out the
Cougars’ athletes on the team.
A thletic D irector Cindy Jones said these Cougars represent the true meaning of studentathletes.
“ I’m very pleased, and I think they should be commended for their efforts,” Jones said. “ I
think it speaks to the student-athletes’ capabilities to balance their academ ic endeavors and
their athletic dem ands and it also speaks to the level o f talent academ ically and athletically the
coaches are recruiting.”
While the Cougars’ athletes were excelling in the classroom , the S IU E team s were enjoying
success on the field o f competition. During the fall, the wom en’s tennis team went undefeated
in the regular season and won the G LV C Tournament. With an overall mark o f 8-6-1 and a
conference record o f 4-4-1, the wom en’s soccer squad advanced to the “ Final Four” o f the
conference post-season tournament. In their inaugural season, the volleyball team made the
league post-season tournament, going 15-15 overall and 10-11 in league action. The wom en’s
cross country team placed fourth in the G LV C championships and the men harriers, who were
ranked in the Top 25 throughout the season, finished third in the championships.
The conditions for being named to the team included maintaining a cumulative grade point
average (G PA) o f at least 3.00 or attaining at least a 3.20 G PA in each of the preceding two
sem esters, being a starter and not being a freshman or first-year transfer.
