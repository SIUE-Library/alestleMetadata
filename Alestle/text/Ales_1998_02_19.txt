SIUE accommodates students by making
computer technology more accessible

Students take advantage of e-mail provided downstairs in the University Center. This is
one way SIUE uses computer technology to accommodate students. Housing is also
doing its part by making a new internet connector accessible to all housing residents.

Metro-east students invited
to SIUE for Career Awareness
■ BY D O R E E N

NEWS STRINGER
On Feb. 20, from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. the schools of
Engineering, Dental M edicine
and the School of Nursing will
be hosting its first annual Career
Awareness Fair in the Goshen
Lounge. The fair is designed
to fam iliarize grade school,
high school, and com m unity
college
students
with
quantitative programs.
Dr.
Cornell
Thom as,
representative
of
M inority
Affairs at the Dental school said
that he is excited about the fair.
“We are looking forward to
meeting students from all over
the metro east who are interested
in the sciences,” Thomas said.
“There will be information on
the program s offered and
recruiters on hand for . the
students to speak with. W e’re

hoping that it comes off very
well.”
Ron Banks, assistant to the
dean of the school engineering,
said the Career Awareness Fair
is a great opportunity for young
students to view academ ic
programs that are offered at
SIUE.
“We are targeting the
younger students to make them
aware of the careers offered in
the sciences,” Banks said. “The
school of nursing and the school
of engineering as well as others
have excellent programs.”
Banks said there is faculty
with industry experience who
have excellent dialogue with
students.
There will be representatives from
the departments of computer science,
construction, civil, electrical, industrial
and mechanical engineering, chemistry,
anthropology, biological sciences,
school and college relations and the
Environmental Resources Training
Center.

In
cooperation
with
University Housing, the Office of
Inform ation
Technology
is
offering several programs that
will enhance student’s knowledge
and use of the campus computer
network.
A ccording
to
Michael
Schultz, director of University
Housing, one such program is the
equipping of the computer labs in
Woodland Residence Hall and
the Cougar Village Commons
Building with new software
programs to assist residents with
their academ ic pursuits. This
allows students free access to the
Internet and other campus
information systems.
Data jacks, currently in use
in
W oodland
Hall,
allow
residents instant access to the
world through e-m ail and the
world wide web without using a

modem and tying up phone
lines,” Schultz said.
Currently W oodland Hall has
the data jacks and Prairie Hall
will also incorporate this feature
upon com pletion in August.
Cougar Village will also receive
data jacks as part o f the
renovation process that will
occur between this summer and
next spring.
According to Tim Brown of
the Office of Inform ation
Technology, the new method of
connecting to the internet that is
being phased in by OIT is the use
of the ethemet card instead of the
modem.
“The ethemet card is 50 to
200 times faster than a modem.
A lso, one doesn’t need to
disconnect the ethem et card (as
opposed to a modem). There is
continuous availability,” Brown
said .

White house taking case for U.S.
military action in Iraq to the public
W ASHINGTON (AP) —
President C linton, laying the
groundw ork
for
possible
airstrikes against Iraq, said today
that America’s military is ready
to carry out its mission and “the
American people have to be
ready as well.”
W hile saying that a diplomatic
solution is preferable, the
president said the United States is
prepared to act unless Saddam
Hussein soon allows free and
unfettered
inspections
of
suspected weapons sites.
And Clinton warned that the
United States was willing to keep
using force until Saddam relents.
“If he seeks to rebuild his
weapons of mass destruction,”
the president said, “we will be
prepared to strike him again.”
In a speech at the Pentagon,
Clinton said Saddam has used
chem ical
w eapons
against
foreign adversaries and even
against his own people. And if
America’s allies do not act now,
Clinton warned, Saddam “will

conclude that the international
community has lost its will. He
will then conclude that he can go
right on and do more to rebuild
an
arsenal
o f devastating
destruction.
“And someday, some way, I
guarantee you, h e ’ll use the
arsenal,” the president said.
Clinton
cautioned
that
airstrikes alone would not
eliminate Saddam’s arsenal. “But
it can and will leave him
significantly worse off than he is
now in terms o f the ability to
threaten the world with these
weapons or to attack his
neighbors.”
Clinton said United Nations
inspectors have faced "lies,
stonewalling, obstacle after
obstacle after obstacle.”
Saying he still hopes for a
diplomatic solution, Clinton said
it must be “a genuine solution
and not simply one that glosses
over the remaining problem. A
diplomatic solution must include
a clear, immutable, reasonable,

simple standard: Iraq must agree,
and soon, to free, full and
unfettered access to these sites
anywhere in the country.”
Clinton spoke at the Pentagon
after
being
briefed
on
preparations for possible strikes.
His speech was broadcast live on
major television outlets.
“Let there be no doubt we are
prepared to act,” the president
said. “But Saddam Hussein could
end this crisis tomorrow simply
by letting the weapons inspectors
complete their m ission.”
Clinton
said
Saddam
committed him self at the end of
the Gulf War in 1991 to allow
free inspections. “One way or
another we are determined to see
he makes good on his own
promises,” the president said.
Rallying Americans to support
his decision, C linton said, “I
know that the people that we may
call upon in uniform are ready.
The American people have to be
ready as well.”

Fam ilies grieve after police m isidentify teen killed in w reck
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) —
Two southwest Missouri families
were left grieving after police
m isidentified the victim of a
traffic accident that killed a 17year-old Republic girl.
A 1991 Honda Accord driven
by Rachael Howell struck a guard
rail near the U.S. 60-65
interchange near Springfield
early Saturday, the M issouri State
Highway Patrol said. The impact
tore open the driver’s side door
and dragged Rachael, who was
driving alone, underneath the car.
She died later at a Springfield
hospital.
Police found only one purse in

the seat of the car, and it held
identification for Erin Carlson,
16, of Brookline. More evidence
pointed to Erin, including a
picture in the purse that hinted
the girls had similar builds. Also,
the car’s registration records had
Erin’s name on them.
“The picture looked like it
m atched,” Springfield police
spokesm an M ike G reen said,
though an exact identification
based on the picture was nearly
impossible because o f Rachael’s
injuries.
Erin, who was sleeping at a
friend’s house when the accident
happened, had loaned the car to

Rachael and left her purse inside.
Holding Erin’s identification
and knowing of the registration
records, police called her mother,
who then rushed to Cox Medical
Center South. She was met by a
hospital chaplain.
“They said they tried to do
everything they could at the
scene, but she was dead on
arrival,” said Robbin Carlson, 43.
“They asked me if they could
call anyone.
“The officer cam e in and
handed me Erin’s driver’s license
and her insurance card,” she said.
“I can’t remember anything after
that.”

Hours later, relatives of the
Carlsons swarmed to the family
home. It was one of those friends,
calling his girlfriend to tell her of
Erin’s death, who discovered that
police misidentified the victim.
“I’m thankful and sad at the
same tim e,” said M ichael
Carlson, 43, who caught the first
flight home from a business trip
in Boston after hearing the news.
“I feel like I’ve been given a
second chance. A t the same time,
I feel bad for (R achael’s
family).”
Police said their mistake
couldn’t have been avoided.
“Nobody feels worse about it

than we do,” Green said. “We do
the best we can with the
information we have.”
The only other way to identify
Rachael would have been
through m ore extensive tests,
such as fingerprint or DNA
analysis, Green said.
Though the Carlsons were
glad to have their daughter alive,
they said Saturday was a difficult
day.
“I’ve had a life taken away
and given back,” Robbin Carlson
said. “I ’m beside m yself for
Rachael’s father.”
Rachael was buried Sunday in
Republic.

Jilted bride lunches with groom on the eve of Valentine’s Day
NEW YORK (AP) — Now
what will people think of the
jilted bride?
N icole
C ontos
drew
sympathy worldwide when her
fiance left her at the altar and
bolted alone to the Tahiti resort
where they were to honeymoon.
Newspaper headlines and talk
shows labeled Tasos Michael the
loser and Ms. Contos the winner

for boogying at her wedding
reception to “I Will Survive.”
Three months later, the two
were spotted having a daybefore-Valentine’s-Day lunch on
at the swank Hotel Delmonico in
Manhattan.
“I don’t wish to comment
right now,” Ms. Contos, 27, said
Saturday, but told the New York
Post she “never shut off my

feelings for him .”
It’s over, at least according
to Carol Contos, the Manhattan
schoolteacher’s mother.
“They did have lunch, but
that’s it,” she said Saturday. “You
know, it’s Valentine’s Day, it was
for old tim e’s s a k e ... And he flew
back to London.”
Are they back together?
“Oh, no,” the m other said.

The story of the jilted bride
made the rounds in November
when
35-year-old
M ichael
abandoned her and 250 guests at
a Manhattan church. She went
ahead
with
the
$100,000
reception and then told her tale of
heartbreak in the tabloids for
weeks. A tequila company paid
for a Caribbean trip for her since
Michael had snagged the Tahiti

honeymoon.
That was it until Friday,
when the television show
“Extra” nailed the pair coming,
arm in arm, out of the hotel. She
ducked when she saw the camera,
but he looked right into the lens
and smiled.

Letters to the editor

Just another daily brainwashing

Assorted editorials from
around the United States

Things are a little different on the other side o f the fence

Here are excerpts from newspaper editorials on Karla
Fae Tucker, the death penalty and the national budget
Feb. 6
The News & Observer,
Raleigh, N.C., on budget and
tobacco money:
President Clinton took a
calculated risk in making the
budget he proposed hinge so
heavily on money that currently
exists only in the imagination.
Mysteriously projecting that a deal
with the tobacco industry will
yield $65.5 billion for the federal
government in the next five years,
he has already earmarked most of
it for health and science research,
and designated significant chunks
for child care and education.
Those programs address real
needs and would have many long­
term benefits. They are too
important, in fact, to be dependent
on the very iffy prospect of a
tobacco
settlement.
The
administration should be prepared
to find the money somewhere else.
At this point, it’s simply not
clear whether granting the tobacco
industry immunity from future
class-action and state lawsuits, in
exchange for $368.5 billion over
the next 25 years, would be in the
public’s best interest. Such a
settlement could
elicit the
industry’s agreement to disclose
internal documents and to stop
marketing to children, while also
yielding a tidy sum for anti­
smoking and other health-related
programs. Putting tobacco money
toward the kinds of efforts Clinton
proposed would be a fitting
atonement for an industry that has
for years lied to and exploited the
public, particularly young people.

Feb. 5
The Salina (Kan.) Journal,
on Karla Faye T\icker execution:
W hat happened inside the
walls of the prison in Huntsville,
Texas, Tuesday evening was a
tragedy.
What happened outside those
walls was an obscenity.
Inside, witnesses and officials

of the state of Texas gathered
seriously and somberly to watch
Karla Faye Tucker be poisoned to
death in a process veterinarians
would not use on an old dog.
Outside, there was a party
going on. People cheered at the
news that Tucker was going to be
killed on schedule, and cheered
again at the announcement that she
was really dead.
To sing and dance and cheer
at the news that another human
being has been killed is
disgraceful, no matter who that
dead person is, or was.
The people who act that way
are more of a threat to society,
more of a weight upon the Earth,
than a dozen Karla Faye Tuckers
could ever be.
If this is what the death
penalty does to us, and it is, then
we should be rid of it. If Tucker’s
execution helps us to see that, it
will have been worth something
after all.

Feb. 5
The Post and Courier,
Charleston, S.C., on Clinton,
foreign policy:
At this time of impending
presidential weakness, the nation
needs a bipartisan foreign policy.
President Clinton’s legal problems
create a shadow of uncertainty that
could
weaken
American
leadership in the world. Clinton
can, and should, minimize that risk
by asking for Republicans’ advice
and support in protecting and
advancing the nation’s interests.
What to do about Iraq’s
defiance of the United Nations is
the most immediate and most
serious cause for concern. As the
United States attempts to put
maximum pressure on Saddam
Hussein to allow U.N. weapons
inspections, it must assemble a
united front with other nations
ready to support the use of force as
a last resort.

Children are lied to a lot because they're seen as vulnerable and they must be sheltered.
Quite often, this is very appropriate. But some lies just seemed a little less than
appropriate. I can remember all the lies I was told as a child: George Washington chopping
down the cherry tree, Davy Crockett killed a bear when he was only three years old,
Christopher Columbus discovered America, babies came from storks, etc. I was told them
all. yet, even as a child I was skeptical. I’m glad I was always the inquisitive type. I was
Danielle the only one in my Bible study class that wanted to know where the dinosaurs fit in during
the book of Genesis. In it, God was creating things in days, and in my books they were
Belton
saying that dinosaurs have come and gone in millions of years. Needless to say, I didn’t
get an answer. When you're a child, you never do.
But it’s sad when an adult is still getting brainwashed. I don’t blame children for believing just about
everything they’re told. They are children and therefore impressionable. But adults need to stop trusting
others for their information and take it upon themselves to seek the truth.
I received a letter the other day. In the beginning o f this letter, (which had no signature or return
address) 1 was informed of a group of people that the Alestle wasn’t paying much attention to. The writer
pointed out that we had run many stories about BSA (the Black Student Association) on campus, and
although the issues concerning BSA may be important, what they (the w riter’s group) had to say was just
as important. Instead of receiving a piece of information that could be followed up and researched, I
received a slanderous internet printout against Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. To my
knowledge, since I’ve been here, the Alestle has never run a story on Louis Farrakhan, although he may
have been mentioned during the Million Woman March last fall, yet I still received this particular letter.
It was the second letter in it’s nature that I have received.
In this letter I was asked to seek out the “truth,” but I was only left wondering “the truth according
to who?” An illegitimate internet source that couldn’t be proved? The sad part about it all is that a person
would have to believe this to actually send it. I wondered who fell into the brainwashing pit that day? it
was just another lost soul trying to find themselves in the radical, right wing groups of today, and was
slinging mud in the direction of things they didn’t understand. I was “informed” in this letter that “We’re
at a time in American history where it’s almost a crime to be a white man.” This is brainwashing at it’s
best. Many have claimed that white men are under some sort of attack when the only oppressors of white
men are other white men. White males dominate the number of senators, CEO’s of corporations, House
of representative members, judges, lawyers, businessmen, team owners, and SIU presidents. Every
president and vice president of the United States has been a white male. White males make up the
majority of the work force, they run civic government, they run big business and they own all major news
outlets. This leaves me to wondering, how this person came to this conclusion. Those aren’t exactly the
signs of an oppressed group. Now the poor and middle class, whether white or black, have always had to
bear the burdens of our government, but what does that have to do with white male oppression? I cannot
say the same things for white males as I can for blacks or women. It would be nice if I could say that this
is a country based on liberty and quality and that all is fair. But this is the same country that declared that
“all men are created equal” and at the same time condoned slavery. We are, after all, a country of
paradoxes.
I was not surprised by the letter. It was my second. The first letter was about Morris Dees. The letters
don’t bother me, I actually enjoy reading them. They remind me of elementary school and my daily
brainwashing there. It’s just funny how people can find themselves believing in things that are illogical
just because they’ve become convient to believe in. The beliefs are almost like scapegoats for their own
illogical behavior. I don’t know what could cause one to believe such things, but is a apparent that things
are a little different on the other side of the fence outside mainstream society.

U.S. economy will not be jeopardized by attack on Iraq
ATLANTA (AP) — The U.S.
econom y is strong enough to
withstand any “oil shock” that
might follow an assault on Iraq,
the president o f the Federal
Reserve Bank of A tlanta said
Tuesday.
Jack Guynn renewed his rosy
econom ic forecast for this year
and also played down the im pact
of A sia’s financial crisis.
G uynn did note that “ oil
problem s have in fact wreaked
havoc” in the past with the U.S.
economy.
But he said .the current U.S.
econom y now is better able to

absorb any oil disruptions
stemming from a Persian Gulf
crisis.
“I think if you look at the
balance we currently have in the
U.S. economy, w e’re better able
to sustain some kind of oil shock
than we would have been in
some of those other periods. I
think that’s im portant,” Guynn
replied when asked about the
potential im pact if President
Clinton carries out threatened air
strikes on Iraq. His comments
came in a question-and-answ er
session following a speech to the
M idtown Rotary Club.

He also was optim istic in his
speech that there would be no
harsh U.S. fallout from the
problems that have undercut the
currencies and financial markets
o f Asian countries.
“A big unanswered question
for 1998 is w hether the Asian
crisis will be a small tap on the
brakes or a big, tw o-footed
brake-locking skid off the road,”
he said. “I expect it will be the
form er - a m odest slow ing
effect.”
He also said that even as
A sian im port prices fall, he
doesn’t think they necessarily

foretell lower retail prices for
U.S. consumers.
“It’s my hunch - and the
em pirical evidence on this is
decidedly
m ixed
that
consumers may not see the sharp
price drops many people are
forecasting,” he said.
G uynn said a variety of
factors - such as U.S. importers
wanting to protect the long-term
health of their Asian suppliers
and their relationships with them
- may m ean low er price
increases at the retail level
instead o f price cuts.
He also said the impact of the

A sian dow nturn on the U.S.
Southeast will be lim ited
because less than 15 percent of
the region’s exports go to the
A sian crisis nations and the
export
mix
is
largely
interm ediate goods - such as
chem icals, plastics and wood
products - that are needed in the
production of final goods.
As a Federal Reserve bank
president,
G uynn
makes
recommendations on monetary
policy and last year was one of
the regional officials who had a
vote on setting interest rates.

Christian school teacher attacks husband outside church with a knife
TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) —
A teacher at a Christian school
borrowed a knife from a student
and stabbed her minister husband
with it in a schoolyard, police
said Saturday.
No charges were filed in the
case. Police did not release the
names of the couple because no
charges were filed and the
w om an involved has m ental
health problem s, police Capt.
Ronald Berg said.

Police could pursue charges if
Mrs. Goetze is determined to be
mentally competent, even if her
husband does not wish to
cooperate, he said.
The attack happened Thursday
when the 31-year-old teacher at
Trinity Baptist Christian School
stabbed her 31-year-old husband,
an assistant pastor of the church
that runs the school.
Police found the couple
covered with blood in the private

school’s yard outside the church.
B efore attacking her husband
with the 4-inch stainless steel
knife, the woman reportedly
yelled “H e’s going to kill our
son” or “H e’s going to take our
son,” police said.
M any
of
the
students
witnessed the attack, said Berg.
However, B rother Ronnie
Mills, pastor of Trinity Baptist
Church and head o f the school,
said there were no eyewitnesses.

Police could not get anyone at the
church to come forw ard with
much information, the Texas City
Sun reported Saturday.
The teacher often borrows the
knife from a 17-year-old student
to cut open boxes, police reports
state. The student was allowed to
bring the knife to school every
day because it’s a Swiss Army
knife, Mills said.
Police identified the woman
only as a teacher or teacher’s aide

at the school. But the newspaper
quoted
unidentified
school
sources as identifying the couple
as teacher Tammy Goetze and
minister, Jason Goetze, both 31.
G oetze suffered a large
laceration on his scalp, a cut neck
and a cut to his hand in the attack,
reports showed. Mrs. Goetze was
cut on her right low er leg.

Small town America plans to keep big city vice at bay
PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) — If
you’re planning to start an escort
service in Pikeville, h e re ’s a
name worth considering: “Scarlet
Letter Liaisons.” Or how about
“Cinderella Companions” ?
Your date won’t be wearing a
Scarlet Letter. But she will be
carrying photo ID on her chest
with the word ESCORT in big
bold letters.
And come midnight, you’re
on your own again, or else your
Cinderella may be arrested as a
curfew violator.
Oh, and forget those sexy
miniskirts. Hemlines must be no
higher than 6 inches above the
knee, necklines no lower than 4
inches below the collarbone.
It’s all spelled out in an
ordinance passed by Pikeville
(pop.
6,500),
small-town
America’s answer to the vices of
the big city.
The law, w hich regulates
everything from cleavage to what
escorts can drink on the job, was
enacted after a Pikeville man
named Eugene E. King went to
City Hall for a license to operate
LaFemme Erotica/Fantasy Girl
Escort Service.
He says he wanted to hire out

exotic dancers for birthday and
bachelor parties but was told he
had to apply as an escort service.
Instead of a license, Pikeville
enacted an ordinance designed to
stop him.
“The ordinance was so tight
you couldn’t run a church under
it,” says King.
M ayor Steve Combs is an
attorney and acknowledges that
the ordinance might go a bit too
far.
But
he
says
small
communities like Pikeville, a
coal town three streets wide in
the Appalachian foothills, have a
right to protect their way of life.
“I guess it was a small-town
city commission’s best effort at
protecting our people from
something
we
were
all
vehemently opposed to,” Combs
says. “I don’t think we need it
here. We like to grow, but that’s
one way we don’t want to grow.”
He says the city is trying to
regulate something it sees as the
slippery slope to prostitution,
drugs and organized crime. Larry
Webster, an attorney and local
new spaper satirist, calls the
reaction archaic.
“Apparently those things are
only tolerable if done in the

privacy of the Oval Office,” he
says with a laugh. But Pikeville
isn’t alone.
W hen a Chippendale-like
male dance troupe announced it
was coming to London, Ky.,
(pop. 7,200) 18 months ago, the
county quickly passed an
ordinance banning nude dancing.
Last month, M orehead (pop.
9,000) adopted its so-called
“bikini ordinance” in a record
two days after a bar advertised
for
dancers
for
“adult
entertainment.”
“I think a lot of the big-city
morals and the big-city vices are
now creeping into our smaller
tow ns,” says Morehead Mayor
Brad Collins. “I feel this is one
way to try to stop it.”
King says he came up with the
party service after his hardware
store was robbed and his
restaurant equipm ent and air
conditioning businesses went
bankrupt.
The
parties
would
be
videotaped; his fee would be
$150 an hour, split evenly with
the dancer and the videographer.
He never even got the
application form.
Three days before Christmas,

BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) —
An orangutan couple that have
become celebrities in Thailand were
reunited on Valentine’s Day after
being separated for a year.
The orangutans, Mike and Susu,
whose nearly human "marriage” had

a nationwide television audience in
1996, were moved to separate
quarters in lanuary 1997 after Susu
gave birth to a son, Monsit.
Mike, now 12, was jealous of the
attention showered on the infant and
his handlers at the Lop Buri Zoo, 115

kilometers (70 miles) north of
Bangkok, feared he would harm him.
The Nation newspaper reported
Sunday that Mike had regained his
equilibrium and moved in with his
family to a new, 1.5 million-baht
(dlrs 30,000) ape house at the zoo.

“Escort,”’ the ordinance reads.
“Said identity card m ust be
visible at all times on the upper
right front portion o f the escort’s
torso while the escort is
providing escort services.’’Not
much fun, says Webster.
“Imagine that your station in
life had come to the point that
you had to hire a prom date, and
then you go to take this escort
with you that has a sign that says,
“Hello, my name is Trixie. I was
hired. This guy can’t get a regular
date,” ’ he says. “Not going to
happen.”
King says he went to great
pains to establish a reputable
business. He says that when he
advertised for dancers on the
Internet, he let applicants know
that no prostitution would be
allowed. To make that clear, he
says, he deliberately set his fees
25 percent lower than the prices
charged by so-called “fullservice” escorts.
After the storm hit, he even
tried changing the com pany’s

Military leaders have said in
recent days that U.S. casualties
should be expected.
Defense Secretary W illiam
Cohen said Monday he had
signed orders that would send
5.000 to 6,000 more troops from
armor and helicopter units to the
Kuwait region.
That would bring U.S. ground
forces there to about 10,000,
including about 1,500 troops who
are on maneuvers in Kuwait, and
3.000 soldiers from Fort Stewart,
Ga., who got their orders Monday
to deploy to Kuwait. More than
25.000 U.S. troops are in the
Persian Gulf region, along with
320 aircraft and two aircraft
carriers.
The troops are intended to
deter Iraq from moving against
Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.

and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Ohio, also planned to
address
Middle

European citizens by satellite.
Clinton has been unable to match
the international coalition that
went to war against Iraq in 1991.
Albright, known for her ability to
discuss
foreign
policy
in
laymen’s terms, was expected to
visit several other U.S. cities
while Clinton edged toward a
military blow.
A CNN-USA Today-Gallup
poll released Monday found that
54
percent

surveyed said they favored more
diplomatic action, up from 46
percent Feb. 1. Sixty-four percent
said the goal should be to remove
Saddam from power, while 31
percent said air strikes should be
used to "substantially reduce”
Iraq’s capacity to develop
weapons of mass destruction.
The poll, which had a margin
of error of plus or minus 3 to 5
percentage points, depending on
the question, surveyed 1,014

Palestinian authority shuts down west bank broadcasters
RA M A LLA H , W est Bank
(AP) — Under pressure from the
U nited States and Israel, the
Palestinian A uthority clam ped
down Tuesday on expressions of
support for Iraq, shutting down a
major West Bank radio station
for six hours and ordering
dozens of other broadcasters to
get new licenses.
At a m arch in Bethlehem ,
hundreds of Palestinian students
burned U.S. and Israeli flags and
shouted “Saddam, we want the
ch em icals,”
and
“B eloved
Saddam, hit Tel Aviv.”
Palestinian
radio
and
television stations have been
ordered not to broadcast any
commentary related to the G ulf
crisis. On Monday, Palestinian
police
closed
Shepherd’s
Television, a Bethlehem station,
after it broadcast footage of a
banned dem onstration and aired
a call-in show on which callers

made pro-Iraq statements.
A police official speaking on
condition of anonymity said the
station was closed because it
incited against the Palestinian
A uthority
and
“higher
Palestinian interests.”
The Voice of Love and Peace,
Ram allah’s largest radio station,
was closed for six hours Tuesday
while station officials met with
Palestinian authorities who
reiterated their demand that no
Iraq-related com m entary be
aired.
“This isn ’t dem ocracy,”
station owner Mutaz Bseiso said
afterward.
Palestinian
A uthority
officials refused to comment on
the closings.
A high-ranking Palestinian
security source, also speaking on
condition of anonym ity, said
there were “new arrangem ents”
for licensing radio and television

stations. “We are asking all the
stations to submit their licenses
for exam ination,” he said.
Owners of the 34 privately
run radio and television stations
in the West Bank were told they
needed new licenses from the
Interior Ministry. Tarek Kayyal,
owner o f Fame Television in
Hebron, said that would require
a security clearance that would
be virtually impossible to get in
time to stay on the air.
“The bottom line is they want
to close us dow n,” he said.
Daoud Kuttab, who runs a
television
station
out
of
Ramallah, criticized the move as
" a very dangerous precedent”
that made a mockery of the rule
of law.
“It seem s we are in an
undeclared state of emergency,”
he said.
Abdul Sattar Qasem , a
political science professor at An

Najah University in Nablus, said
the Palestinian Authority wanted
greater control over the media so
it could concede to Israeli
demands without criticism.
U nder pressure from the
United States, the Palestinian
Authority last week banned proIrafi protests, but the order has
largely been ignored, and some
protests have deteriorated into
clashes with Israeli soldiers.
About 400 students marched
Tuesday
from
B ethlehem
University, carrying Iraqi and
Palestinian flags and shouting
“Saddam ,

and
“ Beloved
Saddam, hit Tel Aviv.”

The ordinance won final
approval on Jan. 26. About a
week later, King and his wife

Lexington for a fresh start.

He says he’s given up on the
escort business.

perforine
for meet at S I U E this weekend

■ BY C O R E Y S T U L C E
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
A humorous play about death will be
perform ed at the C om m unications
Building Theatre beginning this weekend.
“ Shadow B o x ,” the Tony aw ard
winning play by M ichael Cristofer is
directed
by
W illiam
G rivna.
Performances will be held Feb. 20-21 and

27-28 at 7:30 p.m. and M arch 1 at 2 p.m.
G rivna described the show as being
“about dying, involving three terminal
patients and their fam ilies.”
Death is usually not treated as comedy,
but G rivna insists there are some very
funny situations in the production.
“It is a dram a with some very funny
scenes and I hope the audience will relate
to it because at one time or another we are

all
confronted
with
death,” Grivna said.
One o f the
reasons G rivna chose
this particular play is
because death is a
universal concept that
affects everyone.
SIUE theatre
students will m ake up
the cast o f “ Shadow
Box.” Grivna said that
young
people
tend
to ignore death and
the play w ould be a
good way to encourage
his
students
to
contemplate mortality.
Grivna will be
available
fo r
a
discussion o f “Shadow B ox” - with
m em bers of the audience after the
show on Feb. 21.
Tickets are available at the SIUE Fine
A rts Box Office, $7 general admission
or $5 for senior citizens and students
with a valid ID. Information about the
show is available at (618) 692-2774
or toll-free from St. Louis 621-5168,
Ext. 2774.

WWII veteran recalls the bombing
and capture that changed his life
■ BY S T E P H E N W H IT E
LIFESTY LE REPORTER
It was a cloudy day over Berlin during W orld W ar
II. A B-17 bom ber flew 28,000 feet above the ground,
piloted by a crew o f nine young men, the oldest only
22-years-old.
There was a pilot, a co-pilot, a navigator and a
bom bardier — all com m issioned officers. A lso aboard
was an engineer, rad io operator, ball turret gunner, tail
gunner and tw o ace gunners. It was only their fourth
m ission, but it w ould be their last.
On Oct. 6, 1944, after a bom bing run on the
D aim ler Benz aircraft engine factory in B erlin, a
G erm an an ti-aircraft shell severed a large oil line on
the m assive B -1 7 ’s m ain engine.
“The G erm ans shot us dow n,” Forest W ilm outh, the
engineer, said. “T hey shot us at 28,000 feet w ith an 88m illim eter shell. T he engine caught fire, the fire got
back to the tanks and before the wing burned off and
she went in to a tight spin, we got an order from the
pilot: ‘Hit the silk .’”
At 24,000 feet, nine men m ade a leap into the
unknow n. All survived the jum p, but that was ju st the

beginning of a long ordeal that would leave Forest
W ilm outh injured perm anently by a string of health
problem s related to w artim e traum a.
He broke both o f his collar bones when he landed in
Germ any over 50 years ago. Upon hitting the ground,
he was greeted by a G erm an soldier with a subm achine
gun in a VW Jeep. Im m ediately, he was taken to a
G erm an Air Base with several other U .S. airmen.
C ivilians stole his parachute ju st for its silk.
L ater at the prison cam p, Stalag Luft Four, he
developed stom ach ulcers from poor nutrition —
ulcers that left scars detectable by X-ray 30 years later.
“We never got enough to eat,” he said. “Two or
three tim es a week the G erm ans w ould give us a few
vegetables like turnips and kohlrabi. Never any m eat.”
As a prisoner o f war in Germ any, he w alked over
600 m iles across the country from one prison to
another during a three m onth period.
F inally, on M ay 2, 1945, the 101st A irborne

“The first thing they did was
give us a shower in the coldest
water I’ve ever been in.
“Then they burned all of our
clothing and everything except our
personal items. We were outfitted
with British uniforms and flown to
Brussels where we were turned
over to Americans,” he said.
After failing a physical exam
and undergoing several weeks
of treatment for ulcers and nerve
problems at a hospital in Colorado
Springs, Colo., Wilmouth was
discharged on Sept. 26, 1945 with
a 50 percent disability.
He is now 72, a member of
Meadow Heights Baptist Church in
Collinsville, 111. He credits his
ability to overcome illness to the
power of God.
“When I became a Christian,
my
health
improved
tremendously,” he said.

Page
He was drafted into World War
II in 1943 as a 20-year-old. He
spent 33 years with the U.S. Army,
retiring as a sergeant. He is a
lifetime member of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars and the National
Rifle Association. He is also a
Shriner and until two years ago he
led the annual Shriner’s Parade in
Belleville, 111., for seven years.
“I’ve never seen that parade,”
he said, chuckling. “But I’ve been
in it. Last year I told the parade
organizer that I couldn’t make it
because my wife was just getting
out of the hospital and I couldn’t
leave her home alone.”
Forest remembers it all, the
good and the bad. He speaks in a
deep, lyrical, sonorous voice.
When he calls upon his memory,
he is able to recount the past as
precisely as clockwork, telling
stories with the timing of a good
stand-up comic. It is only when his
beloved wife, Margaret Wilmouth,
is mentioned, that his controlled

12

♦

and reserved diction breaks free
into escapades of short, romantic
vignettes.
Margaret, whom he married in
1945, died in April, 1995. Forest
remembers one day in particular
with her as “a day of absolute
tranquility.”
“I had an uncle that had a boat
on Rattlesnake Ferry on the Big
Muddy River,” he said, his deep set
eyes glazing in fresh tears. “It was
a beautiful, mild day in September.
We went up the river to the bend
and saw dozens of giant pecan
trees. The only thing we could see
or hear was nature. We could hear
the geese squawking and could see
the squirrels carrying nuts to and
fro. Me and Margaret sat under a
giant pecan tree that was hollow at
the top and split in two. I started to
see golden honey bees flickering in
the sunbeams. We laid there until
evening, just the two of us,
daydreaming. Compared to the
war, this was pure bliss.”

Giant pig makes a great
attack animal on the farm
CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — She’s no dainty
Miss Piggy decked out in pink and pearls. She’s
Tunia, the 230 pound man-chasing pig who defends
her home with the ferocity of a mad dog when she’s
not eating or sleeping.
Tunia, a black and white sow of questionable
breeding, earned her weight in piggy snacks this
week when she chased an intruder from her
ow ner’s backyard.
It was late morning Wednesday when Tunia’s
owner, Kimberly Herron, heard Tunia barking like a
dog, tapping her pink snout against the back door.
W hen Herron opened the door, a strange man was
standing there.
Suddenly, Tunia shot past her and chased the
man to a com er of the yard. The man was just steps
ahead of the pig when he hoisted himself over the
back fence and fled.
“If it w asn’t for Tunia, I don’t know what I
would’ve done,” Herron said Friday as she stroked
her porcine pal in her living room. “I’m not able to
run from anyone or defend myself. I’ve got to have
protection.”

Herron said she suffers from partial brain
damage and paralysis from a 1981 car accident.
While her condition has improved far beyond what
doctors predicted, she would be no match for
an intruder.
Tunia wags her straight skinny tail and sits on
command for a cookie.
“When she hears a noise, she gets up and
barks like a dog. She doesn’t know she’s a pig,”
Herron said.
Herron developed a fondness for pigs when she
spent tim e as a girl on her uncle’s farm in
Wisconsin. She once owned a Russian Boar, but her
husband had to kill him after he repeatedly charged
at people and the backyard fence.
“He had these really big tusks,” she said.
W hen H erron’s husband gave Tunia to her in
November 1996, Tunia fit in the palm of her hand.
“She was supposed to be one o f those potbellied
pigs,” she said. “Now, my husband teases her and
tells her she’s big enough to go on a spit.”
But as long as Herron has a say in it, Tunia will
have a seat at, not on, the dinner table.

Screenwriter Eszterhas plans to recruit
comic Drew Carrey for next picture
CLEVELAND (AP) — Hollywood screenwriter
Joe Eszterhas says he wants television star Drew
Carey to star in his new movie about a Cleveland
man trying to cope with a failing marriage.
“M ale Pattern B aldness” is to be shot in
Cleveland, Eszterhas’ hometown, starting in May.
Eszterhas said Carey, also a native Clevelander,
would be a natural to star in the $40 million
Paramount Pictures movie.
“Personally, I want Drew to do it and I think
we have a good shot at getting him,” Eszterhas
told the Akron Beacon Journal in an interview

published Saturday.
The movie will be directed by Betty Thomas,
whose credits include Howard Stern’s “Private
Parts” and “The Brady Bunch M ovie.”
“I love the idea of Drew, Betty and I working on
this together,” Eszterhas said Friday while in town
to promote his Hollywood satire, “An Alan Smithee
Film: Bum Hollywood Bum ,” which opens in
Cleveland Feb. 27.
Eszterhas’ last film, the semi-autobiographical
“Telling Lies in America” with Kevin Bacon, was
shot in Cleveland in August 1996.

Man does 104 mph in a 45 to dry his car
GREAT FALLS (AP) — A
man ticketed for doing 104 mph
in a 45 mph zone offered a novel
excuse: He was ju st air-drying
his newly washed truck.
Cascade County Sheriff John

Strandell said Raym ond Lutz,
28, was cited for reckless driving
Sunday afternoon when he was
picked up on radar. He faces
a fine of up to $300 and 90 days
in jail.

W hen he was stopped by a
deputy, Strandell said, Lutz
explained “that he had ju st got
done washing his truck and was
trying to dry it off.”

the line-up after being in an
automobile accident a few weeks
back to put SIUE ahead. He drained
a three-pointer of his own to give his
team the 47-44 lead. This turned out
to be a lead SIUE would never
relinquish as they went on for the
10-point win.
Sames had a solid 22-points and
eight rebounds while Shum finished
with 18 points going 3 of 6 from
downtown. Tim Holloway and
Travis Wallbaum both had 11
points. Beny contributed 10 points
in just
over
15 minutes
of play.

Kreke adding two in the closing
seconds of the game. Kreke is
second on the SIUE all-time blocks
list with 19.
Sames paced the Cougars with a
17-point night and added eight
boards. Shum followed up his 18point performance against IUPU-Ft.
Wayne with 15 points in the win
over St. Joseph’s.
Kreke scored 12 points and
worked the glass for 12 rebounds.
He could break the 1,000 career
point mark with 20 points
this weekend.
SIUE is currently 15-8 overall
and 9-7 in the conference with the
GLVC tournament coming up on
Feb. 24.
The Cougars tangle with Quincy
in their final home game tonight at
7:30 p.m. and then cross the river to
battle Missouri-St. Louis on Saturday.

Both teams have fallen to SIUE
earlier in the season. The Cougars
downed UMSL by 12 points on Jan.
10 at the Vadalabene Center and
defeated Quincy on Jan. 31 by nine
points in front of a crowd of over
2,400 spectators.
‘W e dominated the boards in the
last game against Quincy,”
Margenthaler said. “We need to do
that again.”
Although UMSL is struggling
with a 2-14 conference record,
Margenthaler is looking for them to
be up for their last home game of
the season.
“It’s a tough process when you
know you’ve already qualified for
the tournament,” Margenthaler said.
“We need to try and build our
momentum in these last two games
instead of losing it.”

note; looking

competition

SPORTS REPORTER
A pair of road victories secured a
spot in the Great Lakes Valley
Conference
tournament,
but
avoiding a let down will be the task
at hand this weekend.
Wins over Indiana/Purdue-Ft.
Wayne and Saint Joseph’s last
weekend leave the SIUE men’s
basketball team in sixth place with a
chance to move up to fifth
this weekend.
The Cougars put on an offensive
show
in
a
90-80
victory over IUPU-Ft. Wayne
on Thursday.
Rusty Sames and Tommy Shum
had nine and eight points
respectively in the first half, but the
Cougars found themselves down
two at the break.

“This was a great offensive
effort,”
head
coach
Jack
Margenthaler said. “We built up
some much needed momentum.”
The Cougars specialized on the
other end of the court against Saint
Joseph’s on Saturday night in
Rensselaer, Ind.
Everyone who saw action
contributed at least one rebound for
SIUE in a 75-63 win over
the Pumas.
“Defensively we played the best
that
we
have
since
the
last Quincy game,” Margenthaler
said.
The Cougars owned a narrow
34-31 lead at the intermission, but a
balanced offensive attack helped
SIUE pull away.
SIUE had a season-high eight
blocked shots with Berry leading
the team with four and Nathan

D efending South D ivision cham ps ranked no. 7 in nation
■ BY JASON TRIPLETT to back-up last year’s fifth place
SPORTS REPORTER
As of Jan. 21, the Great Lakes
Valley C onference baseball
coaches picked Lewis University,
the defending North D ivision
cham ps and Southern Illinois
University at Edwardsville, the
defending
South
D ivision
champs, to win it all again.
Is it altogether too early to
make predictions about a 50
game season? The NCAA
Division II Top 30 Preseason Poll
thinks not, putting SIUE at No. 7
in the nation and Lewis at No. 14.
The speculations will come to
an end on Feb. 28 when the
Cougars baseball team will open
the regular season w ith a
double-header against Missouri
Southern State.
Cougar head coach Gary
Collins has held practices indoors
and out trying to prepare his team

finish in the NCAA Division II
Baseball tournament
“Preseason is going really
fast,” Collins said. “We’re getting
close; I need to work the pitchers
from the mound and the weather
hasn’t helped.”
The Cougars are returning 5 of
10 starters and 36 of last year’s
37 wins from the pitchers mound.
Pitching and defense win games
and Collins has that and offensive
w eapons to aid in the quest
to repeat.
On the mound, Ryan Cox
amassed a 7-4 record with a 4.25
earned run average and 69
strikeouts. The All A m erican,
right-handed
junior
from
Stewardson, II. started 12 games
for the Cougars last year. Another
righty, Aaron Rakers from
Trenton, II., is enduring high
expectations from a team that lost
only one key pitcher from
last year.

On the offensive side of the
team, senior Rob LaMarsh, from
Brussels, II. will be employed for
more duties than just powerhitting. LaM arsh knocked 11
home-runs last season with a .343
batting average with 52 RBI’s.
LaMarsh will also take a bigger
chunk
of
the
pitching
responsibilities than he had
last year.
The
Cougars
also
are
returning two more offensive
threats with LaMarsh. In Collins’
estimation, seniors Mark Briggs
and Mike Robertson along with
LaM arsh make the three best
hitters on the team.
“In these three hitters,”
Collins said, “we have power
and consistency.”
Briggs hit .364 with 7 home
runs and led the team in RBIs
with 61. Robertson led the team
in batting averages at a mark of
.411 and 41 RBIs respectively.
Collins isn’t ready to throw

the GLVC championship victory
party just yet. He knows that his
team is a “big inning” type of
team that isn’t going to flash a lot
of speed on the base paths.
“We are not a stolen base
threat, w e’ll have to hit and play
defense well,” Collins said. “We
are going to have to take
advantage
of
opportunities
to win.”
The preseason coaches poll
last year had SIUE at no. 3 so the
competition isn’t counted out yet
in the GLVC.
“There are 4 or 5 teams in the
league that w e’ll have to look out
for,” Collins said. “Lewis
(University) always has a good
team and don’t forget about (the
University of) Southern Indiana.”
The Cougars first home game
is a double-header against
McKendree College on March 3
at 2:30p.m.

Cougar’s softball ranked
No. 1 by GLVC coaches
for the 1998 season
■ BY SARAH FINLEY
SPORTS EDITOR
Cougar softball has a lot to
live up to this season after being
chosen to win their division.
The Great Lakes Valley
C onference’s softball coaches
chose
SIUE
along
with
Lewis University to win their
respective divisions.
SIUE
finished
with
a
perfect 21-0 record last season
while Lewis finished with a
19-2 record.
SIUE was chosen as the top

pick receiving eight first place
votes and Lewis received seven
first place votes.
The Cougars compete in the
Southwest division with other
teams such as Quincy, Southern
Indiana, and Kentucky Wesleyan.
Lewis University competes in
the Northeast division with
IU PU-Fort
Wayne
and
Wisconsin-Parkside.
The Cougars start their season
on Friday, February 28th against
M issouri-St. Louis at home.
Missouri was ranked 4th by the
coaches.

■ BY BRIAN ANDERSON
SPORTS REPORTER
Southern Illinois University
Edw ardsville
finished
its
grueling regular season schedule
with a loss to the Fighting Illini.
SIUE’s Tim Michel continues
to wrestle well this season as he
recorded the lone victory for the
cougars with a fall over H.
Simpson of Illinois. Michel took
the spot of injured Jessie Montez
in the 126 pound position, but
Montez plans to be back for the
post-season tournaments.
The Cougars top wrestler,
Titus Taylor saw his winning
streak come to an end as he lost
narrowly in the Illinois match.
Titus is now 16-5 and heads into
the regional tournam ent as a
heavy favorite to qualify for the
Division II National tournament.
“Titus has been w restling
very well since Christm as
break,” head coach Larry
Kristoff said.
The cougars only ranked
wrestler, No. 4 Jason Carter, has
been out with an injury but
should be ready to qualify
for Nationals.
More information and final
predictions will be given on each
Cougar wrestler competing in
the regional tournament.

A sore right knee will keep
center David Robinson out o f the
San Antonio Spurs’ next two
games.
“The All-Star center will be
re-evaluated Friday and could
return for the weekend games
against Utah and Phoenix,”
coach Gregg Popovich said
today.
Tests showed that Robinson
has “jum per’s knee,” a common
problem among NBA players.
The condition is caused by a
roughening of the cartilage under
the kneecap.

EAGLESON
Disgraced hockey impresario
Alan Eagleson has become the
first elected member of Canada’s
Sports Hall o f Fame to be ousted.
The organization’s board of
governors said today that
Eagleson was expelled to uphold

the reputation of the hall.
The unanimous decision was
actually reached Feb. 5, when the
board of directors last met but
they delayed announcing the
decision to give hall officials
time to inform those governors
who were not at the meeting.
Eagleson is serving an 18month jail term for defrauding
Hockey Canada, the NHL, the
NHL Players Association and
Labatt Breweries of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
He has been disbarred and
been asked to surrender his
Order of Canada honor. There
are also calls for his ejection
from the Hockey Hall of Fame.

HALL
New York Jets kicker John
Hall was arrested on charges of
carrying m arijuana and drug
paraphernalia.
Hall w as stopped Monday
while driving a 1990 Ford
Bronco that he was thinking
about buying, said North Port
Police Lt. Kevin Sullivan. Police
stopped him because a computer
check
show ed
the
plates
belonged to a 1984 BMW.
The arresting officer smelled
burning marijuana in the car,
Sullivan said. Hall, free on $240
bond, is to be arraigned
March 13.
Police said they found 5
grams of marijuana, about a fifth
of an ounce, along with a pipe
with burnt residue. Hall told
officers
he
had
sm oked
marijuana earlier in the night,
according to the arrest report.
NFL
policy
prohibits
marijuana use by its players, but
the league does not test at this
time of the year. Hall could face
a fine and a suspension.

WILKINS
The St. Louis Rams are
pursuing free-agent defensive
end Gabe Wilkins of Green Bay,
and have reportedly offered him
a multi-year deal.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch
reported Tuesday that both the
Rams and NFC West rival San
Francisco 49ers are believed to
have made multi-year offers of
around $4 m illion a year to
Wilkins. The newspaper said the
Rams’ offer is believed to be
larger am ount than what was
stated in the earlier contract.
Rams coach Dick Vermeil and
executive vice president Jay
Zygmunt met with Wilkins and
his agent, Tony Agone, Sunday
in Baltimore, where Agone is
based. Then Wilkins visited with
49ers officials Monday.
Wilkins, 26, is an unrestricted
free agent. In his First full season
as a starter in 1997, he had 50
tackles, 5 1/2 sacks and two
defensive touchdowns.

Steinbrenner looking into rumors of tampering in Arizona
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - New York Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner said Tuesday baseball is checking rumors
that Arizona has tampered with Bemie Williams.
Williams, scheduled for a salary arbitration hearing
Wednesday in Phoenix, is eligible for free agency after
this season. Since Andy Benes signed with the expansion
Arizona Diamondbacks, rumors have swept baseball that
Williams will sign with Arizona after the season.
Benes and Williams are represented by the same agent,
Scott Boras.
“I d o n ’t know w hether that’s the case or not,”
Steinbrenner said of the allegations. “I hope it isn’t
because that would certainly be tampering in the worst
way if there’s any contact whatsoever. We’ll just have to
see on that. There are people looking at that.”
While the owners’ Player Relations Committee hasn’t
conducted any investigation, executive council

spokesman Rich Levin said the council was aware of the
allegation.
In the past, executive council investigations have
dragged on for months, even years, without resolution.
“The Arizona Diamondbacks have not been advised by
major league baseball that any type of complaint has been
filed with their office,” the Diamondbacks said in a
statement. “Any inquiries to our office appear to be a
backdoor reference to potential tampering charges with
simply do not dignify a response. There will be no further
comment from our organization unless we are notified
that a complaint is filed.”
Yankees manager Joe Torre, who talked with Williams
by phone Monday, said the outfielder will report to camp
by Friday.
“Bemie said he was looking forward to being here and
he didn’t want to be a distraction,” Torre said. “There’s

going to be some distractions, but he’l l ... try to just get rid
of this contract stuff and have baseball questions then.”
Williams is seeking a $3.7 million raise to $9 million,
which would be a baseball record for a one-year contract.
The Yankees are offering $7.5 million.
Reliever Graeme Lloyd is day-to-day after slightly
straining a lateral hip rotator Tuesday. Lloyd felt
discomfort after completing half of his scheduled 12minute stint off a bullpen mound. The left-hander is
recovering from double hernia surgery last December.
New York player development vice president Mark
Newman said the Yankees remain interested in pitcher
Orlando Hernandez, but added the matter is not “white
hot.” The Cuban defector is the brother of 1997 World
Series MVP Livan Hernandez. Newman isn’t confident
about signing Ricardo Aramboles, the highly regarded 16year old Dominican pitcher Ricardo Aramboles.

Young ump takes stand against rowdy Little League coach
MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - A
15-year-old freckled-faced boy
took the witness stand to testify
against a Little League coach
accused of shoving him after a
rowdy game.
Kyle Bova was one of two
young umpires working the game
played by 10- and 11-year-olds

1 9 9 8

on Oct. 5, 1996 in Milford.
Coach Richard Bums, 39, was
charged with breach of peace for
allegedly shoving Bova into a
fence when the youngster called
off the game in the second inning
because the adult coaches began
taking the game too seriously and
screamed at the calls.

“It (the game) didn’t finish
because the coaches got out of
hand,” Kyle said. “They were
yelling and got thrown out of the
gam e.”
The
young
ump
told
prosecutor M ark Hurley he
ordered the coaches off the field
“for
sw earing
and

BLACK HISTORY M O N T H

unsportsmanlike conduct.”
He said Bums marched his
team off the field and then
returned and pushed him into a
gate.
“He pushed me from my
shoulder into the fence,” said
Kyle, who was then a seventhgrader.

S o u th e rn

Illinois

“My back hurt a little bit.”
Kyle told his parents what had
happened and they took him to
the police department to file a
complaint.
Burns is charged with breach
of peace, a Class B misdemeanor
that could reap six months in
prison and a $1,000 fine.
