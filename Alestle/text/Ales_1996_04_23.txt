Prisoner is probed after TV is damaged
• A prisoner in the St. Clair County Jail is being investigated for damaging
public property after allegedly smashing a TV set.
Jerry Dotson, 30, a prisoner in the “M” block at the jail, was removed at 9
a.m. Sunday to another cell area after fellow inmates accused him of smashing
the tier television set, valued at $250. According to a report from the St. Clair
County sheriff’s department, Dotson, who was being held on probation
violation, said he tipped the television stand, picked it the set and smashed it
on the floor because he was being “picked on” by other inmates.

letter to the editor.

Is a minimal level of economic security good for all?
At the risk of boring the A lestle’s readers to
death, I will once again address Matt Gross’
questions and contentions over my editorials
concerning the guaranteed annual income.
Hopefully more people than just he and 1 are
enjoying this exchange.
In his most recent letter, Gross compares apples
and oranges. For instance, in reply to my assertion
that Sweden, Denmark and Norway had higher
Gross National Products per capita than the US, he
shows that these countries actually have lower
“ National Products.” Gross' World Fact Book
measures the Gross Domestic Product, not the Gross
National Product. The distinction is an important
one. A country’s GDP measures only the total goods
and services produced within the borders of that
country, while GNP measures the total national
goods and services produced whether they are
located within the country or outside of it. This
makes the GDP per capita a much less valid measure
of a nation’s living standard. Small countries such as
Sweden, Denmark and Norway are greatly under­
counted by this measure when compared to large
nations such as the US which owns vast natural
resources and land. The GNP per capita is generally
accepted as the best measure (though far from
perfect) of a country’s standard of living. GNP per
capita in 1993 for the four countries in questions
were: Denmark: $26, 510; Norway: $26,340; Sweden:
$24,830; US: $24,750. These numbers are significant
because the US used to have much more equal
distribution of wealth and income than we do. In
addition, Sweden, Norway and Denmark have much
more equal distributions of wealth and income than
we do. Our GNP per capita is so high largely because
of the enormous wealth that has been inherited and
invested by our upper class.
Gross claims 1 have overlooked these countries’
high unemployment rates. Yet, as I pointed out in my
previous letter, our unemployment rate is artificially
low due to the way we measure it. Many social
scientists feel that if a common m easure of

unemployment were used for all advanced
economies, unemployment figures would become
incredibly similar. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
complies records of alternative unemployment rates.
In 1993, for example, the official unemployment rate
was 6.8 percent, however, it was 10.2 percent if all
“ recently discouraged” workers were counted.
Gross' claims of a low US unemployment rate are
not valid.
Gross also claims that unemployment has not
risen since 1950. This reminds me of the time Rush
Limbaugh tried to claim that there was no holocaust
of Native Americans because there is roughly the
same number of them living in the US now as there
were back in the 1870s! The truth is that
unemployment no matter how you measure it
fluctuates from year to year. For instance,
unemployment was only 2.9 percent in 1953, but a
full 9.7 percent in 1982 during the Reagan recession.
Further, an increasing trend of unemployment has
been identified since the 1950s in the LIS. In the
1950s the average unemployment rate for the decade
was only 4.5 percent. In the 1960s it rose to 4.8
percent, the 1970s saw a rate of 6.2 percent and the
1980s averaged 7.3 percent. But again, we are not
unique. Gross is quite correct when he asserts that
Sweden is approaching double-digit unemployment.
What he does not tell you is that Sweden spent the
1960s, 70s and 80s rarely peaking a rate of 1.9
percent. Global unemployment is now higher than at
anytime since the Great Depression. Machinery in
the Industrial age was made for mass production and
it resulted in mass employment. This is no longer
what is happening. Now lean production requires
computerized automation that results in lean
employment.
Gross Claims that if automation is producing
joblessness then the underdeveloped countries
would be better off than we are. Apples and oranges
yet again. I am sure he realizes that these countries
have not yet industrialized and of course, Ihey are
not going to be as well off as the advanced nations.

Most of the world is still in the process of, or has yet
to be, industrialized. My comparisons are valid only
for advanced nations and Gross knows it.
Finally, Gross states that I find him insensitive
because he believes “people should earn their
money.”
“Some people work harder and produce more
and therefor should make more money," he says. I
completely agree. But can a Chieano migrant laborer
earn the same amount of money from equal amounts
of hard work as a Wall Street executive? What about
those individuals who inherit great wealth and never
have to take meaningful employment? What about
“ unearned income" from stock ownership, as it is
called? What 1 said is that people should not be
treated as commodities. Someone should not starve,
smother or freeze to death because they can not find
a job. Socialists support a meritocracy, but this can
only be achieved by neutralizing the ascribed
advantages that the wealthy inherit that allow them
to rig the game. I am glad to know that Gross
supports the social welfare state. He must then feel
that the disabled and the elderly should be paid
money even though they have not “earned” it.
Should young children with poor parents have to go
to work? What I have argued for is a minimal level
of economic security for all. It would pay $6,000 per
year on average, though it would increase over the
course of one’s life.
This proposal, instead of restricting how
Americans spend their money, as Gross claims,
would instead greatly enhance it. Do the poor really
have meaningful consumption choices? Do you
think an extra $6,000 a year at the expense of a few
millionaires is a restriction or an enhancement to
your freedom?

commentary.

For politicians and the media: Keep it simple, stupid
D A LLA S (AP)— Several weeks ago, in a modest stab at analysis, there
appeared in this space a discussion of the flat tax. This, of course, was a
presidential campaign plank of Steve Forbes, who has since fallen off a cliff or
perhaps has joined a comedy troupe.
The essay promptly attracted a postal onslaught, mostly likening your
humble servant to a primitive beast with long ears and a bray. The flat tax,
fumed the correspondents, would destroy the financial structure of the land
and make us ripe for a Chinese takeover and maybe cause an outbreak of
scurvy that would scar generations to come. These protesters strongly
suggested that my future commentary be confined to the infield fly rule and
the moral code of the average NFL millionaire.
Obviously, your bungling agent did a sloppy job on the flat tax topic. My
intended point was that the average slob could UNDERSTAND the flat tax.
There’s not too much about taxes that the Addled Majority can break down
into small enough chunks to digest. We see words like “net disposal income,”
and our eyes cross. For one, I have never understood “voodoo economics,”
other than having a vague uneasiness that the term is not politically correct.
Once we understand what the heck these politicians are talking about, then
we can decide whether we favor or oppose it. The flat tax, we can understand.
Do the whole income tax report on a postcard, dadgummit, instead of the
current wad of forms that would plug every drain in Highland Park.
The Addled Majority can understand that. Not necessarily favor it but
UNDERSTAND it. There is the same attraction about this new sales tax
proposition. Buy a pork chop and add a nickel to the cost. That’s it. No reports.
No files to keep. No shelters. Simplicity, that’s the ticket.
Ross Perot made his biggest public impression last time on his televised talk
when he used pie-shaped dojiggers for his visual aids. The common Joe could
understand what he was talking about. This slice goes to political consultants,
this slice goes to attorneys, this little piggy stayed home, etc. A-B-C stuff.

Take Pat Buchanan, for another example. He leaves no doubt where he
stands. On illegal immigration, he doesn’t befog you with a flurry of technical
jabberwocky. He keeps it simple. “ Build a fence” he says. You may not agree,
but you dang sure understand.
Darrell Royal once made a memorable point in discussing his coaching
theories at the University of Texas. He doted on simplicity. “A confused player
cannot be iggressive,” Royal said.
You migiit apply that logic to elections. A confused voter cannot decide
what he wants, what is best for him and his. As a result, he votes for his
granddaddy’s party or whoever looks best on TV. Or worse yet, he votes not at
all.
Even most newspapers now seem to be making an effort to simplify reports.
(The old trade advice was: “Write it so the Kansas City milkman can
understand it.” ) But time was, if the Kansas City milkman tried to absorb a
stock story on the business page, he would have to lie down with a cold
compress.
Perhaps the most valuable advice to all politicians and media folk is the old
KISS formula: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
The parable of the old ship’s captain comes to mind. For 40 years, the
skipper was widely respected, a solemn and silent man who seldom made a bad
decision. But his crew noticed a peculiar habit. Every morning on rising, he
went to a safe in the wall of his cabin and spun the combination. He would
remove a slip of paper and study it carefully, nod his head, replace the paper
and lock the safe. Every morning.
One day the old captain retired, and his executive officer, elevated to his
post, rushed to his cabin and opened the safe. He took the paper and read it
carefully: Port — left. Starboard — right.
Worked for him.

bracelets and how to recycle,” Jasmine Hillard said.
The African Student Association, along with
volunteers, taught the families traditional African
dances, how to make beaded jewelry and tie headwraps.
“We wanted to give the kids a taste of our
culture,” Luso Mmthali, of the African Student
Association, said.
As part of a service learning project, members of
an Environmental Issues and Conflicts class offered
information on the importance of recycling and how
families and citizens can take an individual
responsibility in recycling.
“No matter where you live, everyone needs to

take an active part in saving the planet,” Monique
McCormick, a student and volunteer from the class,
said.
“Everyone Belongs” was the theme of the event
and everyone seemed to feel that everyone did.
“ Look at the kids’ expressions,” Mei-May Lee,
graduate assistant in the Kimmel Leadership center,
said. “I was surprised that many of the games played
were international and played all over the world.”
UCF, co-sponsors for the event, used the slogan
“We All Smile in the Same Language.”
“ I think the event was good and allowed our
families and children a chance to increase their
awareness of other cultures and traditions,” Joyce
Schrader, member of UCF, said.

AmeriCorps and ChildCorps volunteers provided
information on teaching children how to deal with
differentially-abled individuals.
“We taught the children how to use sign language
and understand how a hearing aid worked,” Brian
McKelley, AmeriCorps and ChildCorps volunteer,
said.
Other organizations, such as Indian Student
Association, Chinese Student Association and
various other groups taught the children games and
activities ranging from Japanese origami, Chinese
calligraphy, and storytelling from Indian mythology.
“I think the kids had a really great time,” Hope
Erwin-Sipes, resident assistant in Tower Lake
Apartments, said.

SIUE starts new recycling program with information booth
for paper. Bins will also be placed for newspapers next to all
Alestle newspaper stands.”
The goal of the university recycling program is to recycle at
least 40 percent of the waste on campus by the year 2000,
Schnitzius said.
In order for the university to reach its goal, at least 120 tons
of office paper, 100 tons of cardboard, 36 tons of aluminum, 44
tons of newspaper and 25 tons of scrap metal need to be
recycled each year.
In 1994, the university recycled 56 tons of paper, saving 952
trees and 182 cubic yards of landfill space. In 1995, 89 tons of
paper were recycled, resulting in the saving of 1,513 trees and
267 cubic yards of landfill space.
The program is being funded through a grant provided by
the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs
and is working in cooperation with the Student
Environmental Action Coalition (S.E.A.C.) on campus.
For more information on the SIU E Recycling Program, call
David McDonald at 692-2438 or Steve Coffey at 692-3584.

By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
The Environmental Health and Safety department at SIU E
passed out t-shirts, reusable mugs and other promotional
items Monday in the University Center as part of a kick-off to
celebrate the new SIU E Recycling Program.
The information booth, set up in the UC, provided not only
informational brochures and a video presentation, but also
featured the bins that will be used to collect the recycled
materials.
“The bins will be placed in various places on campus this
week,” Tom Schnitzius, of the environmental health and
safety department, said.
Schnitzius said that the bins will be placed in areas
depending on the type of material to be collected.
“For example,” Schnitzius said, “bins for cans will be
placed near all vending machines and all offices will hold bins

Computers upping the ante in high-stakes world of cheating
PITTSBURGH (AP)—The age-old academic dilemma of
how to catch cheaters is getting a boost in the information age
as universities try to figure out how to catch culprits, and the
culprits try to elude detection.
The difficulty is heightened by computer-savvy students, a
director of computer support services at the University of
North Carolina in Chapel Hill said.
“It’s like the arms race. Each side can develop more and
more powerful methods,” Allan Fisher, an associate dean with
the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University,
said.
“There are more and more ways to cheat,” Fisher said. “But
it can be matched by more and more sophisticated ways of
detecting it.”
At Carnegie Mellon, students creating computer programs
for a class can have their projects scanned by software that can
sniff out a plagiarist by matching up similarities with other
programs.
And when the university’s students take exams in computer
classrooms, the terminals they work on are electronically sealed
from the outside world— “sanitized,” as Fisher puts it— so they
can’t help themselves to data in an off-campus or dorm room
computer.
At the University of Pittsburgh, encryption software is used
to jumble exam questions and answers so hacker students can’t
access them ahead of time. The tests are then translated back
into English by a professor using a password.
Still, as in the old days, truly determined cheaters aren’t
likely to be stopped by even the most sophisticated technology,

experts say.
“ You can find a preprint of a Nobel laureate’s paper sitting
on the Internet if you know where to look,” Kenneth Green, a
visiting scholar at Claremont Graduate School in Claremont,
Calif., said. “You don’t need the term paper services any longer.
In fact, you don’t even have to retype it.”
Even the line distinguishing original work from plagiarism is
getting blurry. For example, if an engineering student seeks
advice on a research project from experts over the Internet, is
that cheating, or using collaborative skills to solve a problem?
“There’s going to be an additional burden on faculty
members in constructing tests so that they don’t just require a
simple reformation of existing data that people are now able to
acquire because of the Internet,” Chris Thomsen, part of a
Stanford University commission studying the impact of
technology on teaching, said.
Some joint research projects submitted by students at
Duquesne University are coded so that a professor can read the
contributions of each author in a different color.
“If there’s no blue in there, and I’m blue, you Tcnow that I
have not carried my fair share of the load,” Lynda Barner West,
director of Duquesne's computer support staff, said.
UNC-Chapel Hill’s Linwood Futrelle said college freshmen
are coming to school bolder about their skills because they are
living comfortably with computers at home.
“A lot of these kids who are coming to college now have
been messing with computers all their lives,” Futrelle said.
“They always have more time to devote to it than we do ... It’s
scary.”

Important Notice To
Graduating Students

Student editor sticks by her decision
TAMPA, FLA. (AP)—The editor of the
University of South Florida’s student newspaper is
defending her decision not to publish a letter
threatening terrorist-inspired violence on campus.
The one-page letter warned of a bomb blast and
other violence if it wasn’t published in the student
paper, the Oracle.
“We did the right thing,” Oracle Editor-in-Chief
Deborah O’Neil said Friday, four weeks after she
wrote about—but didn’t print—the “War Purgers”
letter.
“Everybody on the campus had a right to know
their lives were being threatened. We put in the
story things we thought people needed to know,”
she said.
The typed letter, signed “The One, the Leader of
the War Purgers,” demanded publication or on
April 29 an administration building would be
blown up and an unnamed white female professor
killed.
The letter claimed the “War Purgers” were
connected to the Palestinian terrorist groups
Hamas and the Islamic Jihad as well as to neoNazis.
It also said Jihad leader Ramadan Abdullah
Shallah, a former USF adjunct professor, was due
an apology from the “biased, racist” American
media. Shallah now is the leader of the Islamic
Jihad in the Middle East.

O’Neils March 26 story set off a campuswide
debate and prompted administrators to plan
unusually strong security precautions for a bomb
threat.
On April 29, the day cited by the letter writer,
the campus will be virtually closed.
O’Neil said she didn’t publish the letter in its
entirety because she didn’t want the newspaper to
be manipulated into giving the letter writer a
forum.
Her decision, reached after hours of discussion
March 25 with student newspaper adviser Jay
Lawrence, has resulted in criticism, accolades and
interviews.
The decision by the New York Times and The
Washington Post to publish the Unabomber’s
manifesto last fall had been fodder for class
discussions for months. Students and advisers were
familiar with the criticisms and reasons to publish
and not to publish.
“Their situation was different; they were dealing
with a letter from someone who was a known
killer. “Our letter was from a group no one had
ever heard of.” O’Neil said. “They did the right
thing.”
O’Neil, 24, decided to publish a story about the
letter, quoting parts of it. She doesn’t know who
wrote the letter and hopes it’s a hoax.

Texas funeral home, family battles over body theft
DALLAS (AP)—With the theft of a Texas Tech
University honors student’s body from her grave
still unsolved, relatives are accusing a funeral
service and its corporate parent of negligence.
But attorneys for Restland Funeral Home and
its corporate parent, Stewart Enterprises of New
Orleans, suggest that the lawsuit against them by
Melinda Ann Lee’s family is frivolous.
“It’s just a bizarre crime that we didn’t
perpetuate but which they are trying to hold us
liable for,” Hubert Crouch, a Dallas attorney
representing the funeral companies, said.
“We wanted to do everything we could to help
them through a terrible thing and now we’re being
sued,” he said.
Miss Lee died Dec. 7, 1994, from injuries
suffered in an Oct. 14 traffic accident involving a
drunken driver in Lubbock.
Three days after her funeral, someone bore
through a concrete vault and cut a hole in her
coffin at Restland Memorial Park, between north
Dallas and Richardson, authorities say.
A newspaper carrier found her nude corpse
beside a rural road in far south Dallas three days
later.

Attorneys for Restland and Stewart deny any
lapse in security, saying that no one could
reasonably have guarded against a crime that has
no precedent in Dallas County and little elsewhere
in the country.
Family members have hired attorneys, private
investigators and a former Dallas police chief to
press its view that the companies should have
provided more security through routine patrols.
The body was reburied in an unmarked grave
provided free by Restland. Dallas County sheriffs
officials say the theft case remains open, but that
they’ve run out of leads.
The family’s pastor, who has acted as their
spokesman throughout the ordeal, said he isn’t
sure why Don and Patsy Lee felt the need to file a
lawsuit and face an emotionally draining trial.
“ I’m guessing a part of this has to do with some
kind of closure,” the Rev. Byron Myrick said. “I
know that they were very unhappy, dissatisfied,
angry with the way the removal of Melinda’s body
was handled. I really don’t know all the motivation
for it other than that thing was very painful to
them.”

Brian Lynch w as one of the
coordinators tasked with getting it

gathered boxes from the university

with the cardboard boxes, rocks and "a
lot of duct tape," the group set up camp.
There were about 25 students in all
who participated in the two-night event,
including some freshmen from the nearby
Residence Hall.

Students and faculty walking past the
west side of the Quad last Wednesday
evening couldn't have helped but notice
shantytown.

homeless, particularly the homeless at
the Second Chance Shelter at 240 North Sixth Street in East St. Louis. The
shelter provides temporary housing for homeless families. It is managed by
the St. Louis Bi-State Chapter of the American Red Cross.
Shantytown w as the brainstorm of Mary Garrett, a sophomore majoring in,
spanish and history.
"We were looking for something different. We wanted to get people
thinking," Garrett said .
"The theme w e've been working with this year is 'Apathy Sucks/ We
wanted to be visible and to let people know we're active," Garrett said.

that w e've been so active."
N ewm an Student Union is a "three
'S ' group. Service, social and spirituality.
A lot of the first two and a little of the

last," some members said, laughing.
This academic year, the group went trick-or-treating for food in Tower
Lake, adopted a kid at Christmas and did a lock-in with the local junior high.
They've been on alternative spring breaks for the past two years, this year to
Oklahoma with members from Kimmel Leadership Center and last year to
Mexico.
The idea of spending time outdoors in a shantytown w asn't new to some
of the members. Ben Moss, a freshman majoring in advertising, said he once
participated in a similar workshop in Chicago.
"It helps to bring home the experience of what it's like to be homeless. Of
course, it's not realistic, but it's the closest students can get," Moss said.
The first night, Lynch said, everyone w as in their own spot. It got cold in
the early morning and some students weren't prepared.
The group's fears of stormy nights went unfounded, although Thursday
morning's shower forced them to rebuild their town. The second evening, the
group did things a little differently.
"We took the boxes apart and retaped them ," Lynch said.
"A nd w e put them close together," Moss added. "We sort of huddled
together to keep warm. But still some students didn't come prepared so they
got a good idea of what it w as really like."
"The weather was kind to us, but there w as lightening Thursday morning
and w e were on a hill with (electrical) cables, so w e were a little worried
about that," Lynch said. "We said a prayer and God w as good to us."
The students didn't have lack of food. Someone, unsolicited, brought them
pizza the first night and there were plenty of snacks available the second
night.
The mood of the students, Garrett and Moss agreed, w asn't as
contemplative as one might expect, given the nature of the "cam p-out."
Freshman John Palasz, a mechanical engineering major, said he saw it as a
"break from homework. It w as like camping to me. I brought my guitar and
w e sang."
"We saw it as an education for ourselves," Garrett said. "O n a previous
retreat, we learned w e don't do things for people—w e do things with people.
We have to be involved right there with them."
The group collected about $150 for Second Chance and w as to deliver it
Saturday.
The students have talked about adopting the shelter for future service

‘Carmina Burana’ closes Dance St. Louis930th
season with passionate praise of earthly delights

"D ash in - Dazzle o ut"

(Press Release)
The joys of youth and
spring, the carnal delights of
drinking and dancing, the
twists of fate, and the ups
and downs of love are the
timeless subjects of 20thcentury composer Carl Orff
and the hippest poets of the
13th-century in Carmina
Burana, one of the most
popular pieces of music of all
time. At 8 p.m., on May 3-4 at
the Fox Theatre, Dance St.
Louis
closes
its 30th
Anniversary Season with the
State Ballet of Missouri in a
major St. Louis premiere of
new choreography by Paula
Weber
for
O rff’s
masterpiece.
Carmina Burana is a sonic
spectacular, and Dance St.
Louis is pulling out all the
stops to bring the work to St.
Louis audiences in its full
glory. A chorus of 110 singers
is made up of the combined
choirs of Webster University: the Choral Society and the Chorale led by Dr. Kathryn Smith, and
the Choral Club under Dr. Allen Carl Larson. The soloists— soprano Janice Creswell, tenor Paul
Kirby and baritone Kenneth Roberson— are from the Ensemble Program of Opera Theatre of
Saint Louis. The Ballet Orchestra of St. Louis is led by State Ballet’s resident conductor, Robert
Olson. This is the first time in Dance St. Louis’ 30-year history that such a large chorus has been
amassed to join a dance company and live orchestra.
Tickets range from $17 to $27 for the general public, $14 to $22 for children, students and older
adults. Tickets are available through the Dance St. Louis and Fox box offices and at all Metrotix
outlets, including Famous-Barr stores. Call Dance St. Louis at (314)534-6622, or Metrotix at
(314)534-1111.
Ever since Carmina Burana received its world premiere as a ballet at the Frankfurt Opera on
June 8,1937, it has been one of the most stupendously appealing pieces of music ever composed
in any genre. It has crossed the classical line into widespread popularity. Potent though Carmina
Burana is in concert or recording, however, composer Carl Orff always meant the work that he
called “a theatrical cantata with magical scenes” to come to life on the stage.
Orff believed that music reached its utmost power only when it was part of a total theatrical
experience.
“ You need costumes, mining, body movement. The theater is the only place where words,
music and gesture can make their full impact,” he wrote. The impact he wanted was spiritual,
emotional and intense. So his musical style used catchy melodies, simple harmonies, colorful
orchestration and irresistible rhythms that begged to be danced.
Orff found the perfect poems for his universal themes in a 13th-century manuscript discovered
in his native Bavaria at the monastery of Benediktbeuren (Carmina Burana means “Songs of
Beuren”). The Latin and German words had been written as text for popular songs whose music
had long vanished. Far from being dated or obscure, the poems were pungent, irreverent and
passionate.
The verses were written by poets known as the Goliards, or “big mouths.” The name was
originally given to the poets by their detractors for what went into their mouths— enormous
quantities of booze— and what came out— enormous quantities of vulgar verse. The intended
insult was gleefully taken up by the poets themselves. In love with earthly delights, the poets were
also clearsighted about how fragile they were. Riches can change to poverty, health to sickness
and love to misery in an instant with one turn of the Goddess Fortune’s wheel.
State Ballet’s lyrical modern choreography is by Paula Weber, ballet dancer and professor at
the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
“ I haven’t made up an overall story line,” Weber said, “but I have followed the poems and
made dances to them, and there are stories within, especially in the ‘Court of Love’ section. It’s
all about experiencing life, loving and learning— you’re up one day and down the next.”
Dance St. Louis is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to presenting, producing and
promoting dance in St. Louis. Financial assistance for Dance St. Louis’ programs is provided by
the National Endowment for the Arts, Regional Arts Commission, Arts and Education Councils
of Greater St. Louis and Missouri Arts Council, a state agency.

‘Mystery Science Theater 3000’ makes big screen debut

©1996 Gramercy Pictures. AH rights Reserved
Above: Tom Servo, Mike Nelson and Crow T. Robot watch the awe-inspiring 'This
Island Earth" in the Best Brains, Inc. production of "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The
movie."

By Lenon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
The 1950’s sci-fi “ classic” This Island Earth is the latest movie to get ripped apart by Tom Servo, M ike Nelson and Crow T. Robot. The difference is that
the latest installment of M ST3K is not on Com edy Central, but on the big screen. Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie is a lot like the television show,
except there are no commercials. The guys m ake fun of things, put on skits, and basically have a good time like they always do.
For those who don’t know, M ystery Science Theater 3000 is a show where a man and two robots are forced to watch extrem ely bad movies from the 50’s
and 60’s. An evil scientist, Dr. Clayton Forrester, wants to rule the world by showing a truly horrible film to the planet’s population, thus bringing everyone
to their knees in submission. The problem is that he doesn’t know what movie to show. A s an experim ent, Dr. Forrester captures M ike Nelson and puts him
in outer space on the Satellite of Love. Trapped in space, the doctor forces M ike to watch movie after movie until he snaps. Once Forrester finds the right
movie, the world will be his.
Mike watches the m ovies with his two robot pals, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot. A silhouette of the three can be seen in front of the movie, as though
you w ere sitting behind them. Instead of simply watching the movie, they m ake fun of it for everyone to hear. The result is a bunch of one-liners and jokes
that add to the film and at times m ake you laugh out loud. Unlike the moron that always sits next to you at the dollar show, these three are funny.
In This Island Earth , aliens come down and save nuclear scientist and jet fighter test pilot (?) Cal M eachem ’s life by landing his out of control jet using
a green light from a tractor beam . Not knowing what was happening, he goes back to his second job as a scientist to work in the lab putting pieces of metal
together. While there, he receives a catalog filled with parts that are like nothing he’s ever seen before. He orders a bunch of things and puts together an
“ interocitor,” which enables him to talk with Exetor, a bleached blond guy with a big forehead and a tan.
It turns out that putting together the interocitor was a test to see if Cal was smart enough to be used for his purposes. E xetor then sends a plane with no
pilot to take Cal to a place where other nuclear scientists have been running experiments. A fter a daring escape attem pt, Cal and fellow scientist Ruth Adams
find out that E xetor is an alien who is about to take them to his home planet.
This is not the worst m ovie to ever appear on M ST3K. It does, however, have plenty of m aterial the writers can work with. A ny fan of the show can attest
to the fact that an episode can run anywhere from a few chuckles to outright hilarious. The big screen version is definitely closer to the latter. Many times
during the movie the audience can be heard laughing out loud. A t some points people were actually screaming. It seem s that everyone, including myself,
thoroughly enjoyed the film.
Now that the show has gone big time, it is ironically being canceled by Comedy Central after seven seasons. The only way to see new episodes in the future
may be to sit in the theater. (I don't know if anyone else has picked up the program.) Going to a movie house is fine since the restrictions of television don’t
apply. The cast is able to m ake lewd comments and jokes they can only hint at on TV. There are more opportunities thanks to this new found medium. While
not their best work, it is still very good. If there are any sequels, I hope they are at least written as well as this one. If they are as good, pray they make about
50 of them.

Track hosts GLVC meet; men finish fourth
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter
Distance running has been the strong point
for the SIU E track and field team this season.
With many personal records being set, the
men's team captured fourth place and the
women took sixth place at the Great Lakes
Valley Conference Championships over the
weekend.
The Cougars hosted the season-ending
event on Saturday, which saw the top six
teams from the GLVC do battle.
On the men’s side, senior Gus Coronado
placed first in the 10,000-meter run in a time
of 31-minutes, 58 seconds, to give SIU E the
maximum ten points for the event.
“Gus broke his personal record with the
win,” coach Darryl Frerker said on Monday
afternoon. “He took it from the gun and made
up his mind that he’d take the race.”
In the 1,500-meter run, Travis Roundcount
of Carrollton took first place and ten team
points with a time of 3:58.00 to nip Lewis
University’s Dave Locker by one second. He
also grabbed six more points in a third place
finish in the 800-meter run with a time of
1:54.70. Both of these runs were personal
records for the senior.
“ He had a tremendous m eet,” Coach
Frerker said.
Matt Noyes placed fourth in the men’s
triple jump with a mark of 41 3/50 to claim
Jeremy Paschall/A/esf/e
four team points and ended up in seventh
Matt Noyes took third place in the triple jump at the GLVC
place in the long jump with a mark of 20 2/25.

11:21.00.
Luke Lay of Dow, 111. added 8 points to
SIU E ’s team score with a4hird-place finish in
the 400-meter dash with a personal record
time of 50 seconds even and a fifth place finish
in the 200-meter dash in a time of 22 50.
Wayne Bloemer of Teutopolis ran tenth in
the 800-meter run and sophomore Derek
Bright took fourteenth place in the race.
Streator’s Jason Gass captured ninth in the
5.000-meter run and tenth place in the 1,500meters with times of 17:04.00 and 4:26.00
respectively.
Senior Chris Wolf finished fourth in the
1,500-meter run to give SIU E four points in a
time of 4:02.00.

seventh in the 400-meter dash with a time of
1:02.40.
Vicki Johnson set a personal best in the
3.000-meter run in 10:46.00 which was good

“ She has been coming on strong the entire
season,” Frerker said.

Press Release

Yes, it is true. SIU E now has an Ice Hockey Club. The
club is being organized by Bill Misiak, a Training and
Organizational Development Specialist on campus.
Misiak is in the process of building a competitive
team to compete hopefully in the Illinois/Wisconsin Ice
Hockey League.
The team is in its fourth week of existence and
already has more than 25 players signed up for tryouts.
Tryouts will be held on Thursday, April 25 at 6:15 a.m. at
the East Alton Ice Arena.
At a recent ice hockey high school coaches meeting
at the Arena, Coach Misiak informed them of the new
hockey club forming at SIU E. The coaches were excited
with the idea.
“ Now our local high school players that are not good
enough to play Division 1 or 2 hockey can continue to
play college hockey at a local university,” they said.
Since that meeting, there has been high school
players inquiring at SIU E about the ice hockey
program.
Misiak, a former Detroit Junior Red Wing, has been
actively involved in the development of the youth
hockey program in Illinois for the past six years.
During the 1993-94 season he coached his Cahokia
Pee Wee B hockey team to the Missouri/Illinois Division
title.
The team also is looking for someone to fill the
position of team trainer. The trainers responsibility is to
develop a strong team that will be less prone to injuries.
For more information on the hockey program call
692-2159, or write: SIU E Ice Hockey Club, Box 1168,
Edwardsville, IL 62026.

By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E tennis team was one
victory short of getting the chance
to compete in the championship
match of the Great Lakes Valley
Conference
Tournament
in
Indianapolis over the weekend.
Seeded fourth going into the
tournament, the Cougars had to
settle for a third-place finish in
which they defeated Southern
Indiana.
The Cougars were beaten by
Bellarmine 4-2 in the semi-final
game which would have put them
in a match-up against Fort Wayne
in the championship.
“We had to change our doubles
combo to win the tournament and
it worked at first. Against
Bellarmine we thought we could
win at three doubles with Ethan
Hallberg and Brett Licata, but
they had a tough team and it just
didn’t workout,” head coach Bill
Melissa Wathen/A/esf/e
Logan said Monday afternoon.
Ethan Hallberg serves up another point in the GLVC tournament
please see TENNIS, page 17 over the weekend in which the SIUE tennis team finished third.

Student-Athletes of March
named by advisory board
By SIUE Sports Information
One Cougar who pins them down and another Cougar who
knocks them out were named Student-Athletes of the Month
of March.
Senior Jayson Querciagrossa of Peoria and junior Michele
Sucich of Newark were nominated by Student-Athlete
Advisory Board, which is composed of 12 Cougar studentathletes.
Queciagrossa completed his
career as an SIU E wrestler in
style by becoming an AllAmerican with an eighth place
finish at the NCAA Division II
National Tournament in Greeley,
Colo. The 142-pounder reached
nationals by placing second at
the Midwest Regionals in
Kirksville, Mo. On the year, he
compiled a record of 22-15.
Head coach Larry K ristoff
said
Q ueciagrossa’s
AllAmerican status is indicative to
the type of person he is.
Jayson is a super person, and Jayson Querciagrossa
it was good to see him reach his
goal (of becoming an All-American) because he is a hard
worker and a good student,” Kristoff said. “ He is a very active
student, who is in a number of student groups and he has that
knack to get along with and communicate with people.”
Sucich has helped lead the softball Cougars to an overall
mark of 32-14 and Great Lakes
Valley Conference record of 126, good for second place in the
conference.
The right fielder is tied for
the team lead with six home
runs and four triples. She is
second for Cougars in hitting,
batting .355 with 43 hits. With
her six homers and four triples,
Sucich currently ranks among
the GLVC leaders in both
categories.

The doubles teams for the Cougars were changed to Jason
Geminn and Nate Reede playing No. 1. Callen and Matt
Hanks hooked up at No. 2. Then Hallberg and Licata
rounded out the final position.
The Cougars did receive some good news after the
tournament when the GLVC announced that Geminn, who
played No. 2 on the team throughout the season and No. 1
during the tournament, was tennis player of the year.
Geminn went undefeated at the No. 1 position for the
Cougars in three matches of the tournament and also went
undefeated during the spring season at the No. 2 spot.
“Jason went 9-0 before the tournament and then went 30 in the tournament so he ended with a 12-0 conference
mark. The only two players to beat him during the season
were nationally ranked individuals,” Logan said.
Even with the excellent play of Geminn, the Cougars
were still hobbling a bit.
“Nate Reede sprained his ankle in the first match and he
went on to play the rest of the weekend. We had to ice him
down everyday and it’s real commendable on his part
because he could of elected not play,” Logan said.
The Cougars won the first match 4-0 against St. Joseph’s
to give them the shot against Bellarmine. After the victory
against Southern Indiana, SIU E finished the season at 6-11
and 6-4 in the conference.

Mother Nature
A few brief moments whisper in the wind.
About when spring will start and when winter
will end.
As the blanket unwraps,
you slowly loosen your ties.
To reveal your warmth and beauty
right before our very eyes.
As Death turns to life and darkness info day.
Things that started with no life are blossoming
now in every way.
All time stands still in wait of the next surprise
you’ll bring.
As mother nature shifts from winter to spring.
