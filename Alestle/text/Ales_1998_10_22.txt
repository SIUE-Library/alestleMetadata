Alcohol Awareness Week wraps up
with free party at fitness center
ALESTLE STAFF REPORT
National Collegiate Alcohol
Awareness Week ends Friday
with the Tons of Fun party from 9
p.m. to 2 a.m. at the Vadalabene
Center.
“I encourage students to
come out and have some fun,”
W ellness C oordinator Mary
Byron said. “We would like to
offer students a fun alternative to
drinking on the weekends.”

The nationwide campaign to
make college students aware of
the dangers of alcohol has been
around for more than a decade.
Byron said that students who
can drink legally should do so
responsibly by lim iting the
number of drinks they consume
and not driving while intoxicated.
“This is the 11th year for
Alcohol Awareness Week. It just
keeps getting better,” she said.
The Soup and Substance

series will present information
related to A lcohol Awareness
Week in its program from noon to
1 p.m. today in the Cahokia
Room o f the Morris University
Center.
Friday’s Tons of Fun, now in
its ninth year, is expected to draw
more than 1,000 students and
friends to the Vadalabene Center.

Students and others
looking for health and
healthy lifestyles were able
to get good information this
week
in
the
Morris
University Center.
The SIUE Health Fair
was a fun way for students to
become more aware of heath
issues and services on
campus and in the area.
No matter how health
conscious students might be,

w e ig h

in

a n d

they were bound to learn a
lot at the fair Tuesday.
Students
were
encouraged to visit booths in
the
order
they
were
presented. Those on the
circuit began by getting their
blood pressure and weight
checked by volunteers from
the School of Nursing.
Volunteers explained what
the numbers mean, and if a
student’s blood pressure or
weight was a little high,
volunteers explained how
exercise and a healthy diet
could help.

Guest Column

SlU-Equity: Is this ethical?
SIUE instructors rarely miss
an opportunity to stress the
importance of ethics and proper
ethical behavior in each of the
academic disciplines they teach.
The faculty try to incorporate this
ethical prospective into nearly
every lesson plan and often use
SIUE
adm inistrators
and
adm inistrations
conduct
as
examples of proper ethical
behavior. The m ost recent
example of this seemingly proper
ethical behavior was the decision
by SIUE C hancellor David
Werner and Vice Chancellor for
Adm inistration Ken N eher to
unselfishly donate their recently
approved 2 percent raises to the
University Foundation until all
staff and faculty receive equity
pay adjustm ents. W hat the
instructors d on’t do is share
examples of instances in which
the SIUE administration fails to
live up to this notion of proper
ethical behavior. I say look no
further than SIUE administration
to find examples of improper
ethjcal behavior. You may have to
look closely, though, and read
between the lines.
First, the aforem entioned
donation of raises by Chancellor
Werner and Vice C hancellor
Neher is a smart public and labor
relations move on the two
administrator’s part. It gives the
impression that they support their
staff and faculty when, in
actuality they are just playing it
safe and protecting themselves
against possible criticism from
receiving their raises September
10, while everyone else has to
wait until January 1. The SIUCarbondale Faculty Association
is
even
questioning
the
accountability of the SIU Board

of
Trustees’
decision
to
administer their raises early and
has asked the Illinois Board of
H igher Education (IBHE) to
investigate the board’s decision
making process.
Many of the staff have been
doing more than just waiting
around for the rem aining 2
percent increase to arrive January
1. They have actively negotiated
for real pay equity(which they
consider to be more than just the
2 percent increase) that would
bring the pay closer to their peers
at other com parable
state
universities and institutions. In
fact, according to the IBHE
report “Fiscal Year 1997 Faculty
and Civil Service Salaries,” SIUE
now has the low est paid
university
civil
service
employees in Illinois. However,
during the same time period,
SIUE faculty salaries have
increased from eighth to seventh
place
among
other
state
universities. This was in addition
to raising top adm inistrator’s
salaries to keep up with
com parable adm inistrators at
similar institutions.
Administration and faculty
consider their talent “up for
grabs” by the highest bidder, and
therefore, SIUE feels compelled
to offer an incentive such as
com petitive/equitable pay to
ensure retainm ent o f these
people. The m ajor ethical
problem is the attitude and
manner
in
which
the
administrators are handling the
situation. Essentially it appears
SIUE adm inistrators do not
consider some civil service
employees, such as custodians,
important enough to offer any
pay incentive comparable to that

of other state universities. Keith
Nichols, chief spokesman/spin
doctor for SIUE, effectively
made the civil service custodians
appear
m oney-hungry
by
comparing their average hourly
wage
to
private
industry
custodians’ average starting
hourly
wage
instead
of
comparing civil service wages
with their peers at other
comparable state universities and
institutions.
According to one concerned
SIUE
adm inistrator,
the
university believes that the
employees are content with their
pay. This adm inistrator added
that the university has virtually
no turnover and has many
applicants wanting to start work.
The administrator said there is a
consensus
among
other
administrators that while other
SIUE em ployees are working
hard to help students, the
custodians, because of recent
informational pickets, are making
a nuisance o f their overpaid
selves. This individual even
quoted another administrator in
saying, “If I was their daddy, the
only line they would be walking
is the one between here and the
woodshed.”
Although I am a young man,
and have never heard the phrase,
I don’t think the phrase is
positive. I also do not believe the
actions or attitudes toward the
civil service em ployees have
been positive and certainly do not
think it would fall under the
category o f proper ethical
behavior.

Greek community unity?
This column is for Raven. Happy birthday.
Despite a lot of effort by many, some people still
naturally segregate themselves. It is human nature for
people to seek out others like themselves with common
histories, interests and backgrounds. Uppity, middle-class
Danielle people find other bourgeoisie. Urban trendy people find
Belton
other city socialites. Black people look for other black
people and white people look for other white people.
The same applies to Greek organizations. They are separated
into fraternities and sororities, therefore the men are separated from
the women. And there are historically black Greek organizations and
historically white ones, so blacks and whites separate themselves
from each other.
Although most Greek organizations seem to be indifferent about
changing their racial mixture, here at SIUE there has been a push for
unity in the Greek community. It seemed like a good idea for the
Greeks to support each other and sponsor events together. Through
unity, they could pump more fresh faces and life into the campus
community. As a consolidated group, they could accomplish much
more. Hence, the Ebony/Ivory Extravaganza was born.
Ebony and Ivory calls for white and black Greeks to put on a
show together featuring skits, poetry, dancing and stepping. It is
sponsored by the Greek Council. The program would promote Greek
life as well as give the different groups a chance to work together. It
was a good idea that started last year, but there is still one little
problem — many organizations are not involved, namely the
fraternities.
The sororities played a pivotal role in putting the event together,
but out of the six organizations participating, there are four black and
two white. And of the seven there is only one fraternity participating,
the historically black Alpha Phi Alpha. Fellas, what seems to be the
holdup? There cannot be unity in the Greek community if only
members with ovaries are involved. If it weren’t for the Alpha Phis
and the Sigma Alpha Taus, there would be no white involvement in
these Greek activities at all.
This is a good, positive thing and you'd think more people would
want to be part of it, but they aren't. Therefore what does that say
about us and what does that say about our society.
Maybe I'm being too hard on the Greeks. After all, there have
only been 200 years of race relations in this country and w e’re just
now trying to get used to each other in the realization that nobody is
going anywhere. Maybe all those other Greek organizations had
legitimate reasons for not participating in the show, but participation
is unity. You can say you’re united, but if you can’t show it and if we
can’t see it, is it really there?

D em ocrats aren’t the only ones
This letter is in response to the Oct. 15 article by Marjorie
Amizich. While it is commendable that the Alestle is showing that
there are politically involved students on the SIUE campus, I must
point out that the Alestle only mentioned a worker for the democratic
campaigns. The College Republicans of SIUE are very active in
campaigning for Republican candidates in the area, including those
campaigns mentioned in the article. The College Republicans of SIUE
is one of the most active organizations on the campus, and it disturbs
me that our organization was not contacted about an article regarding
student involvement in campaigns. Whether the Alestle mentioning
only Democratic candidates was intentional or not, I feel that it is
necessary to point out that there is an alternative to the Democratic
Party. With the elections in the immediate future it is imperative that
both political parties receive equal exposure in the Alestle.

Ja n e t Ja c k so n
sold out in Hawaii

“This has been the biggest reaction since Michael! 99
HONOLULU (AP) — Janet Jackson
is following in the footsteps of her brother
Michael, and her fans, as well as Aloha
stadium officials, couldn’t be more
pleased.
The 34.000 tickets for Janet Jackson's
scheduled Jan. 30 concert went on sale
Saturday morning and were gone by late
afternoon.
Mike Sharpe arrived at the stadium
Thursday night to become the first person
in the ticket line that grew to extend
around the stadium by Saturday morning.
“We wanted to make sure we got good
tickets,” Sharpe said. “We knew they
would go fast.”
“This has been the biggest reaction
since M ichael,” concert promoter Tom
M offatt said, referring to M ichael
Jackson’s two sold-out concerts at Aloha

Stadium in January 1997.
“They’re so excited, you know. It’s
Janet,” Moffatt said. “There’s a love
between her fans and Janet Jackson that
I've never quite experienced before.”
Tickets for Jackson’s concert cost from
$35 to $65. The event is expected to pull in
$2 million with $200,000 going to the
stadium.
“A show like this will help us make
money for the stadium and also for the
state,” Aloha Stadium manager Eddie
Hayashi said.
The revenue is welcomed by the
stadium, which is seeing lower ticket sales
for University of Hawaii football games
this season. Traditionally the sale of UH
tickets has accounted for one-third of the
stadium ’s $5 million annual operating
budget.

Have we got an idea for you.

D o D r o p In!

BY COREY STULCE
WRITER A TI .ARGF.
You can send the cards,
letters and bottles of cheap
rot-gut now.
It is official. 1 have
stepped down from my lofty
perch as Lifestyle editor and
I am passing it down
(hopefully to able hands).
I had a good five
semesters as your cultural
leader. We laughed. We
cried. We lam ented and
winced at the thought of
what I do alone in my room
at night. Oh, hasn’t it been
swell? But don’t fret quite
yet faithful followers of filth.
I will stay on with my
newly-appointed position of
writer at large and continue
to wax poetic in this little
column called “Rants and
Raves.” So those of you who
are sick and tired of reading
about what’s floating around
in my w ater-logged head
will just have to suffer a
while longer.
I wanted to wait a week or
two to welcome the new
editor of the section, Sheri,
because I had to make sure
she wasn’t going to run out
of the office screaming like a
banshee. I’ve seen it happen
before. Some people just
aren’t cut out for the
pressure. Me, I revel in it.
But she seems just crazy and
demented enough to stick
with it.
It won’t be easy. I’ve been
through two faculty advisers,
three editors and driven at
least 25 young, feeble­
brained reporters to other
majors. But I did it with
love. Hey, they should have
seen my little horns peeking
out when I first entered the
Alestle office.
All the same, I would like
to wish the new bosses some
luck. You people are not the
easiest to please. Some of
you like a little bit of sleazy,
silly fun and others of you
have cue sticks in your
posteriors. I can deal with
that — I have for two years
now. I think I enjoyed the
adversity almost as much as
the praise.
I only wish I could stay
around here forever, tainting
the soft little skulls of
incoming fresh people. But
I’ve got bigger carp to fry.
It’s a big world out there and
I’ve got a lot of people to
shock,
annoy,
enrage,
delight, nipple-tw ist and
engorge.
I hope I will always have
a little place in your tiny
black hearts. Good night.

The SIUE ice hockey team will battle the
University of Illinois Saturday at 7:30 p.m.

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ear—
Well, M ike Tyson is back in the ring,
and I c a n ’t say I ’m surprised. Folks, w e’re
talking boxing here. T hese m en b eat each
o th e r for a living. T hey get th e ir picture
ta k e n in th e ir u n d erw ea r th e day before
they fight.
W e’re n o t talking ro ck et science, w e’re
ta lk in g p u g ilism . W e ’re talk in g Vegas,
baby, Vegas. T h e place w here you can get a
T-bone ste a k fo r $1.99 at 8 a.m. D id you
really th in k th e tow n th a t m ade Circus
C ircus fam ous w ould n o t let th e head
clow n back in?
Personally, I love w atching Tyson bite ...
I m ean fight. B u t I have a pro b lem with his
having to p ro v e to psychologists th a t he is
m en tally sta b le en o u g h to box. T h in k

a b o u t that. M entally stable e n o u g h to box.
Isn ’t th a t a contradiction o f term s? I d o n ’t
th in k m entally stable p eo p le w ant to get
th e ir face rearran g ed , b e at on a m an they
d o n ’t know for no reaso n an d lose th eir
ability to th ink clearly by th e tim e they
retire. B oxing is a very tough sp o rt, b u t it’s
also e n terta in m e n t and M ike Tyson is a
hu g e draw. E ven though he still has an
a ssa u lt ch a rg e p e n d in g fro m a tra ffic
accident, th e H an n ib al L ec te r o f boxing
convinced doctors he is m entally stable.
W ho are w e talking ab o u t? D r. Suess,
K erv o rk ian and D olittle?
I ’m no expert, b u t d o e sn ’t Tyson have a
h isto ry o f violent and erra tic b ehavior?
A ll this ruling proves is th a t if y o u ’re a

good ath lete you are above the rules and
laws. T hat is the m essage the kids are
getting.
M ike Tyson can m ak e m oney for a lot
of people if he boxes. So these people
d o n ’t w ant him o u t o f th e sport. I’m not
big on saying a th le te s should be role
m odels. I think a p e rso n should be able to
live th eir life how th ey w ant to, no m atte r
if th e y ’re a fam ous ath le te o r not. B ut I do
have a p ro b le m w ith leag u es and
organizations allow ing peo p le like Tyson
w ho have b ro k en th e law several tim es, an
op p o rtu n ity to get rich.
