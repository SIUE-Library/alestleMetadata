by Catherine Klene
Alestle News Reporter

Funeral services for Spc. Ryan C. Garbs,
20, will be held from 10 to 11 a.m. Tuesday
in the Morris University Center’s Meridian
Ballroom.
Garbs was a member of Company B, 3rd
Battalion in the 75th Ranger Regiment
stationed at Fort Benning, Ga. Garbs was
serving in Afghanistan when he was killed in

a helicopter crash Feb. 18.
Garbs’ mother, Jill Anne Garbs, is a
professor at Lovejoy Library.
Garbs joined the army after graduating
from Edwardsville High School in 2005.
Edwardsville
Superintendent
Ed
Hightower said Garbs was an “outstanding
young man” during his time in high school.

even when he was in school,” Hightower
said. “It’s a very tragic situation, and our

Application numbers increase by 1,000
by Zach Groves
Alestle News Reporter

While SIUE is praising the increase in
application numbers, some students are
wondering if the university is biting oft'
more than it can chew.
Admissions and Enrollment recently
reported that as of Feb. 15, more than
5,900 prospective freshmen had applied to
the university, an increase o f 1,000
applications over last year.
“We are still accepting applications
and admitting students,” Assistant Vice
Chancellor
of
Enrollment
Scott
Belobrajdic said.
Graduate student numbers are up as
well. Their number recendy surpassed
819, according to a press release, which is

a jump of 174 compared to the year
before.
Belobrajdic said he believes the
continued increase results from a mix of
elements such as marketing, cost-effective
tuition and word of mouth.
“High interest levels
(record
applications) and strong enrollment
numbers are usually an indication that
students are having a very positive
experience on campus,” Belobrajdic said.
“I would add that expanded recruiting
efforts, facility updates and expanded
marketing initiatives such as the ‘e’
campaign definitely help to attract initial
student interest.”
With the growing number o f students
and even larger number of applicants,
some are questioning SIUE’s priorities.

“They need to resolve the parking
issues before they take more applications,”
junior political science major Daniel Petty
said. “Freshmen should not have a car
their first year.”
Other students like the idea o f a
growing campus, but ask that enrollment
numbers be considered as well, especially
for those who are close to graduation.
Senior speech communication major
Kristin- Koester said she thinks the
attention the university is getting is
beneficial.
“I think it’s good more students are
applying since SIUE used to be known for
its seclusion and small classes.”
However, Koester also said there
needs to be a balance between the number
of enrolled students and faculty members.

Wayne State University adjunct instructor Eric Russell applied to the University of Michigan Law School
but was rejected.

University of Michigan
applicant pushes to keep
gender, race out of admissions
by Kristen Jordan Shamus
Detroit Free Press (MCT)

DETROIT - Eric Russell didn’t get his wish:
he didn’t get admitted to the University of
Michigan Law School next year.
But that is OK with him - as long as his
rejection was without consideration of his race or
gender.
Russell, a 30-year-old white Auburn Hills,
Mich, resident, got word recendy that his admission
to the law school was denied. He said he is prepared
to believe die university followed Proposal 2 which bans the use of race or gender in making
admissions decisions.
“The university stated publicly that they’re in
compliance,” he said Feb. 15. “I’m going to take
them at their word until anything to the contrary
surfaces.”
But he said he’ll keep fighting to make sure
Proposal 2, approved by voters in November,
remains the law of die state.
A soft-spoken and reserved instructor of
Spanish and German at Wayne State University,
Russell is the latest in a line of people who have
fought to end affirmative action in the state’s
university admission policies, a stand that places
him in the company of Ward Connerly, Barbara
Grutter and Jennifer Gratz.
He remains a party in the federal case
challenging
the
Nov.
7
referendum’s
constitutionality, with Russell defending the ballot
question and saying he believes the issue of fairness
outweighs the need for affirmative action. The
American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP and
the group By Any Means Necessary are among
those challenging the constitutionality of the ban,
arguing it only made it onto the ballot through
voter fraud and that it is, on its face, discriminatory.
A scheduling conference is set for March 21 before
U.S. District Judge David Lawson in Detroit.
At issue for Russell is the fundamental right of
voters to have their will carried out.
“People were very angry about this,” he said.
“People who were not even applying to the
University of Michigan were very upset, and I was
too.”
Russell’s belief that the issue comes down to a
question of fairness notwithstanding, affirmative
action supporters say the referendum - and the fight
to implement it, represented by Russell - comes
down to racism.
“He’s a front man for segregation, and that
whatever he’s saying, the truth of the matter is that
he’s aiming to exclude thousands of black and
Latino students from the universities of this state,’
By Any Means Necessary spokeswoman Shanta

Driver said.
“The real heroes are the Latino and black
students who are standing up for their rights,
building a new civil rights movement and
demanding equality.”
After the election, Russell said he was outraged
to hear University of Michigan President Mary Sue
Coleman pledge to fight the ban.
“I believe she was slapping die voters in the
face, and the applicant pool as well,” Russell said.
“To me, her underlying message was ... essentially
we’ll do anything we can to not follow this.”
After that, Russell sought out Terence Pell,
president o f the Washington, D.C.-based Center for
Individual Rights, to represent him in a lawsuit
Russell filed in Washtenaw County Circuit Court
seeking an order requiring the university to
immediately comply with the ban. As someone with
an application to Michigan’s law school, he had
standing to file in court.
Last month, the University o f Michigan
announced it would comply with the referendum,
leading Russell to drop that lawsuit.
The federal case is pending. He is die only
individual mentioned in the case on the side
supporting the ban, while the By Any Means
Necessary has more than two dozen opposing it.
“I’m not suing for admission. I’m suing for
equal treatment under the law without regard to
race,” Russell said several weeks ago. “If they reject
me because my GPA is too low, because my test
scores are too low and they don’t think I’ll be able
to cut it in their program, then so be it.”
Last fall, Russell got involved with Proposal 2
by volunteering in the campaign headed by Gratz
and Connerly, who pushed and passed a similar
ballot issue in California a decade ago.
Russell said he just wanted to support a cause
he believed in.
“I am a newspaper reader, and a news
consumer, so I knew that it was out there, and I
have interest in what goes on in my country, in my
state,” he said.
Russell wrote letters to various newspapers,
supporting the ban.
Russell said he plans to attend Wayne State’s
law school next year, and that he’ll try again for
admission to the University of Michigan through a
transfer.
“What is most important to me is that my
original application and my transfer application are
processed under the new law - that no matter when
I apply, I receive fair consideration,” he said.

Housing is another
concern of Bichsel’s.
“With

arrangements, it is hard to
find a place on campus,” she
said.
Belobrajdic
said he
suggests students on campus
apply for housing as soon as
possible to avoid that
problem,
even
with
Evergreen Hall scheduled to

open in fall 2007.
“We will have more

consulted with Facilities Management and SIUE
Police to determine road conditions on and off of
campus. Neher said he also based his decision on
KSDK Channel 5’s weather forecast.
“At the time that we would normally make a
decision, it was fine,” Neher said.
Neher said he decides early in order to notify
students and faculty as soon as possible.
“If things go bad during the day, things get more
complicated,” Neher said.
Neher explained many faculty and students are
already on campus, and he must decide whether it is
better to send them home immediately or to wait
and see what the weather will do.
“If things were to get really bad during the day,
are we better off' sending people now or will it be
better later?” Neher said.
At 4:30 p.m., the weather and road conditions
were much better ensuring a safer commute for
faculty and students, Neher said.
He did make the call to cancel evening classes
due to high winds and blowing snow. That decision
was made at 2 p.m., Neher said, to allow plenty of
time for the word to get out to students and faculty
Neher said when determining road conditions
off campus, SIUE Police consults with the Illinois
State Police in Collinsville.
Illinois State Police media liaison Ralph
Timmins said SIUE would consult with the

operations shift commander on duty for weather
related incidents. When evaluating weather
conditions, Timmins said the state police look at the
number of traffic incidents and road conditions
reported by motorists.
According to Timmins, there were 85 traffic
accidents within District 111 during the first 10
hours of the storm and 247 by the end of the day.
Neher confirmed that Facilities Management
Director Bob Washburn was involved in a weatherrelated traffic accident in University Park on the day
of the storm.
“In University Park, the responsibility for snow
removal ... rests with the city of Edwardsville,”
Washburn said. “Whether they had done that or not,
I don’t know.”
Washburn could not be reached for comment.
Timmins is also an instructor at Lewis and Clark
Community College, where classes were canceled.
“I think it was a wise decision to cancel classes,”
Timmins said.
He added that it is a difficult decision to make.
Meteorologists are not always right, Timmins said.
“It’s a tough call,” Timmins said.

Open letter written to rude parkers
Dear Rude Parkers,
You know who you are.
Most likely, you
are a person
who
has
absolutely no
concept of the
length of your
hood,
which
causes you to
_, ..
leave four feet
-c-m iiy
between your
Siemer front bumper
---------------- and the parking
line.
Perhaps
you are spatially challenged. I
can accept that. Here’s a tip,
then: Go until you cannot see
the line. If you do this, I will
not, in turn, be forced to thread
the needle between you and the
person behind and across the
drive, who, very often, happens
to
be
equally
spatially
challenged.
More rare, yet also much
more annoying, are those of you

who take up more than one
space. With my own eyes I have
seen a single vehicle occupy four
- yes, four - parking spaces. One
question - are you blind? If not,
what exacdy is your problem?
Pm left only to assume that you
don’t want dings or scratches on
your car. Hey, I don’t either, but
I still park responsibly so that
others don’t have to walk in
from Sgt. Pepper’s. Work with
us, okay?
Then there are you Close
Parkers. It is you who cause the
behavior of the aforementioned
space-hogs, who must have such
a deep-seated fear of having to
enter their car using a shoehorn
and Astroglide that it causes
them to make erratic decisions.
I would suggest the arm test for
you: when parked, reach out the
window of your car - if you can
change the gears o f the car on
your left, you’re too close.
Finally, there are you

baffling characters who back
into spaces, thus forcing you to
have to go the wrong way down
the drive when it comes time to
depart. Why? You appear to be a
proficient parker - why not aim
it the right way and lessen my
risk of having to slam on the
brakes because you fail to
understand directional parking
dynamics?
Thanks for listening, Rude
Parkers. I’ve hopefully helped
you to make better parking
decisions, and at least raised
your awareness
o f how
inconsiderate you can be. If you
can do just a little better, I’ll
overlook your blasting the
Backstreet Boys at 95 decibels.
Sincerely,
Emily Siemer

signature would be required
saying the recipient read through
the “ Ethics Packet for NonCompliant Employees.” The
signature would have to be
returned to the Student

Feb. 23, or the recipient would
be terminated. I guess I should
thank God I have late classes on
Thursdays and wasn’t sick,
because if I wasn’t on campus I
would have been fired.
Even more upsetting was
the fact that the letter and packet
of information was dated Dec.

22, 2006. Does it take two
months to send out vital
information to employees asking
them for their cooperation in a
timely manner when we aren’t
receiving it? The Student
Employment Office said 80
students received their letters
this late.
The handling of the noncompliant employees who took
the ethics test too quickly has
been poorly done. The packets
o f information were handed out
in an ill-timed way that could
have caused problems for some
students who were not present
on campus Thursday afternoon.
Sort of ironic that the people
reprimanding employees about
their time problems seem to
have some also.

Maya Angelou,
the essence of
what it means to
be an American
in the
21st
century has been
shaped
by
A f r i c a n Americans.
Yet it has
taken more than
250 years of American history for
us to finally start recognizing the
contributions
of
AfricanAmericans to our society, and we
still are not quite there.
Black History Month is a
time to celebrate not only the
diversity we share as Americans,
but also to recognize that our
past was turbulent. It was only 40
years ago that the Civil Rights
movement started to break
through the oppression of a
white-dominated
American
society.
For America, it takes one
month a year to remind ourselves
o f the rich history and culture
that has shaped what America is
and is becoming in our world.
Even though we set aside
February as Black History
Month, we should remember the
contributions African-Americans
have given America throughout
the year.
»
Black History Month is more
than a celebration of one group
o f Americans. It is a celebration
o f what it means to be American,
because many of the foundations
of American culture are shaped
by African-Americans. Our
music, art, literature and
philosophy are rooted in black
history.
As we come to the end of
February and the end of Black
History Month, we should not
forget the contributions AfricanAmericans have made to our
society. And we should not forget
that African-Americans have
helped make America what it is in
more ways than our society often
thinks.
As we move further into the
21st century, let’s hope that our
history books start to tell more of
this rich heritage to future
generations.

Don’t put off reading this

Alestle News Reporter

According to Keys and
Hennessey, no longer having their
parents supervise how time is
spent can leave some students
wasting a lot of a precious
commodity.
Taking time out to study is
often bumped off the list of
priorities, particularly when a
student is relishing in the newly
found freedom of parent-less time
management.
Keys hopes to impart on
students the importance of
“learning how to balance things
out, and set aside time (for
studying) every day.” She wants
students to realize that studying
should be a built-in facet of their
schedule, not just something they
do on the side.
Hennessey will speak about
how students spend their time,
and how this allotment reflects, or
fails to reflect, their values.
The
time
management
presentation is geared to “help
students not only manage their
time, but to find balance,”
Hennessey said.
“We want students to be
successful and feel successful ... so
that they don’t pull their hair out,”
Keys said of the overall goal of the
session.

And the tradition continues. The
SIUE track team once again dominated at
the Great Lakes Valley Conference Indoors

Women’s Coach of the Year.
“My name is next to the Coach of the
Year award, however I think it should be

Astrauskas said. “ (SIUE assistant track

and I think it should be an overall staff

continuing the tradition of domination at

“On paper before the meet, we were
basically seated to win the meet,”
Astrauskus said. “However, you never win
a conference championship on paper. You
have to go through each event and see
how well you do, and fortunately our kids
responded and did as well as they have
been doing all year long and that put us on
top.”
In addition to winning Athlete o f the

The SIUE men’s basketball team
defeated The University of MissouriSaint Louis Saturday evening 92-63 in
front of a crowd o f 1,300 on senior night.
The Cougars finished the season 1512 overall and 10-9 in the Great Lakes
Valley Conference.
“We had a great team effort and it
was good for us to end the season with a
win for the seniors,” SIUE Head Coach
Marty Simmons said. “It is going to be
very hard to see the seniors go, but I am
very proud o f the effort that they have
given me and they are going to be missed
very much.”
Senior forward Mike Hardiek was
happy with his team’s effort but upset to
see the season come to an end.
“Everyone on this team has been like
a family to me and it is very' upsetting to
see it all end,” Hardiek said. “It was good

Astrauskas said. “He ran a very good time
in the 400, which will be close in getting
him into the national meet. He also did
well in both the hurdle races and scored a
lot of points for our team.”
Rose also placed first in the 200 with
a 22.01.
The SIUE men finished first in both
the 4x200 and 4x400 meter relays with
times of 1:28.62 and 3:19.31, respectively.
On the women’s side, Simmons
placed first in both 55-meter hurdles and
200 meter hurdles. SIUE Sophomore
Deserea Brown followed a close second in
the 200-meter with a 27.55.
“Val helped us out and scored a lot of
points in a variety o f events: in the triple
jump, in the long jump. (She) ran an

outstanding 200-meter time that was a
qualifying time,” Astrauskas said. “She
also did well in both the 55 and 200-meter
hurdles and broke the conference record
for the 200-meter hurdles, and that’s
always a positive. Val did a lot o f good
things this weekend.”
Brown, who competed in eight
different events, also had a winning
weekend.
“Deserea had a good, quality
performance for us,” Astrauskas said. “I
think she did eight events and she scored
in all o f them. Field events, running
events, she’s pretty much the ‘jack of all
trades.’”
SIUE sophomore Scott Block won
first place in the shot put event by over
four feet and broke the conference record.
Sophomore Kris Kombrink also gave
a good performance.
“Kombrink threw a 59-11 in the
weight throw and he placed, but was only
six centimeters from winning the meet,”
Astrauskas said. “It was nice to see him,

The Cougars, who are 20-7 overall

Conference, were down early as the
Riverwomen went on a quick 10-0 run to
open the game. The Cougars then picked
up some momentum and cut away at the
lead after shooting 6 of 10 from outside
the 3-point arch. As the half came to a
close, the Cougars closed the gap and
went into halftime with a lead of four
points.

After shooting just 32 percent from
the floor during the first half, the Cougars
turned it up a notch and shot for 57
percent during the second half. Many of
these contributions came from the 3point line, helping the Cougars to the
victory.
Another key to success for the
Cougars could be credited to the
contribution of the players off the bench.
The Cougar bench players scored 41
points. Combining their efforts with
those o f the starters, the Cougars came
out of Saturday’s contest on top 86-71.
Sophomore Allison Fogle and junior
Whitney Sykes both had successful nights
from 3-point range. Fogle finished the
night with 9 o f her 15 points coming
from outside the arch. Sykes netted five 3pointers and finished the night with 22
total points. Kennedy also scored 10
points for the Cougars.

most any win. A lot of the singles
matches are 50-50, you may split
those.”

SIUE finished the doubles

gained the No. 2 seed in the West
Division, while Bellarmine
received the No. 3 seed in the
East Division. In a previous
meeting, the Cougars got the
victory by a final score of 71-61.
“Bellarmine will definitely be
ready for us,” Shelton said. “We
know we arc capable of beating
them, we just have to put it
together on both ends of the
floor.”
The season has been an
overall success on and off of the
hardwood. A strong bond among
the girls led to meshing on the
court, which led to the success
the Cougars have seen the
majority o f this year.
The Cougars recorded 20
wins in a season for the first time
since the 2000-01 season.
Another record for the Cougars

this season was Sykes breaking
the all-time 3-point scoring
record set back in 1996 by Terri
Evans. Evans netted 172 in four
years of play while Sykes has
netted 177 in just three years of
play.
“I think the most interesting
thing has been our turnaround
this year,” Shelton said. “It has
been fun to be a part of that and
to get a 20-win season. We have
accomplished a lot this year and
put together some great team
wins.”

Just like the men’s team, the
SIUE women finished first in
both the 4x200 and 4x400 relays.
“The 4x400 is usually done
at the end of the meet and a lot of
the kids were tired so we didn’t

year; but we still ran a provisional
time on the men’s side, and in the

kept on battling and played very
hard for the team,” Simmons
said. “He is the kind of player
who is always battling and he was
a very important part of this
team.”
The
Cougars shot a
scorching 61 percent from the
field in the game. They also went
8-11 from the charity stripe.
“This was the best shooting
performance I have seen from the
team this year and I am very
proud of the way they played,”
Simmons said.
SIUE also shot very well
from beyond the arc going 10-20
in the game.
UMSL (9-18) had its
problems all game against the
Cougars stifling defense. SIUE
forced 20 turnovers and had
seven blocks as well.

The Cougars scored 18
points off o f turnovers and
outscored UMSL 12-0 in fast
break points.
“I was very happy with our
defensive effort tonight and it
was good to see the players never
give up,” Simmons said.
The Cougars dominated the
inside game and outscored
UMSL 36-24 in the paint. The
Cougars bench also had a big
impact in the game as they
outscored UMSL 20-10.
SIUE did a good job
possessing the ball in the game,
which resulted in only seven
turnovers.
UMSL was led by senior
guard Troy Slaten who had 18
points.
Sophomore
guard
Nathan Whittaker poured in 11
points for the Rivermen.
UMSL shot 37 percent from
the field.
There were three seniors
who were honored Saturday
night for the Cougars. Among
them were Hardiek, Johnson and
Clint Burris.
“Obviously we had very high
hopes this year and this is not the
way we thought things would
turn out,” Simmons said. “It is
sad to know that these guys will
be leaving us but I can’t stress
enough how proud I am of my
team.”
