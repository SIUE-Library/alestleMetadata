ALESTLE STAFF REPORT

University Center cafeteria. Most
of the soups are chicken or
vegetable. The cooks skim the
excess fat off the meat and do not
put much salt on the cooked
vegetables. There is always rice,
pasta or some type of potato on
the buffet.
“If we were to put out only
rice, com bread, fruits, veggies or
food that was considered healthy,
the students would complain and
say that there is nothing on the
menu,” Limestall said.
Limestall said she’s observed
a lot of students in her job and
found that “the food that is in

content.”
For example, what is popular
among students is the fried
chicken from the Main Course,

restaurant and the chocolate chip

Founders Hall.

E d ito r

Belton’s colum ns were
necessary

spurred me to write this defense
of her because, not only do her
writings resonate well with a
large cross-section of people on
campus, but I also feel that it is
time someone came out in
defense of an African-American
woman who writes engagingly
about issues that matter to her.
Let me explain why the kinds of
issues M ajor M cLean finds
particularly offensive are actually
subjects that need to be discussed
in a critical fashion on college
campuses.
For
exam ple,
B elton’s
Tommy
H ilfiger
article
bemoaned the blind consumerism
of our culture; of how for many
students function and fashion
become indivisible. Ask around
and see how many freshmen go
out and use their brand-new
credit cards on designer clothing.
I also found Belton’s critique of
Oprah’s weight loss for a fashion
shoot a tim ely piece because
studies show that eating disorders
are sharply rising among college
women. Psychologists find that
the usual method o f getting
recovering anorexics bulimics to
speak on cam pus to be
retroactive. The most effective

I am writing in response to
M ajor M cLean’s letter that
appeared in the Oct. 20 issue of
The Alestle. I find it rather
interesting that the list of issues
he would like the newspaper to
cover — “the Presidential
scandal,”
the
“supposed
corruption” of African- American
Senator Carol Mosley-Braun, the
large amount of female students
entering the university and his
fear of the repercussions this
might have on SIUE’s athletic
program s, his desire for a
criminal justice program at SIUE,
etc. — show a definite bias.
Contrary to popular opinion,
many of us don’t share the same
worldview.
Even more revealing is his
“b e e f’ with the subject matter
chosen by Danielle Belton for her
op-ed pieces. It is a sad fact of
American print journalism that
we have very few high-profile
female journalists writing op-ed
pieces for the larger news
organizations. Major M cLean’s
scathing remarks about Belton

method o f battling eating
disorders is to perform the kind
of historical and personal
analysis o f the fem ale body
Belton does in her essay on
Oprah. Belton’s criticism of a
media figure who had also
succumbed to the pressure to be
thin is the kind of analysis that
might help in dispelling our
culture’s unhealthy obsession
with weight.
I do understand Major
MacLean’s desire to keep the
borders sharply defined between
what he sees as the “high”
territory of print journalism and
the murky land o f popular
culture. But he must also realize
that more than thirty years ago in
The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962),
Marshal M cLuhan argued that
the print media was giving way to
a whole new set of media. And
the old divisions between high
culture/hard-core
news
and
popular culture/”soft” female
issues have fallen like the Berlin
Wall.

RAVES
BY COREY STULCE
WRITER AT LARGE
Every day I feel ju st a little
bit older and out o f touch with
those rascally young people.
This last weekend, out of
the goodness- of m y little old
heart, I agreed to help one of
my friends put together a
haunted house for his little
sisters at their middle school.
It seemed like a good idea.
My friend is dem ented and he
put together some interesting
scenes, like aliens performing
an autopsy on a human captive;
a “Texas Chainsaw Massacre”
room complete with a fire pit
and a burning girl for cannibal
cuisine; a classroom setting
with a maniacal teacher and
lots of blood; and a zombie
room, complete with crypt and
gelatin human organs. It was
quite an accomplishment for
my friend who constructed all
o f the room s basically by
himself.
My job was doing make­
up, which was fun. I got to
cover countless . ju n io r high
kids with latex, blood and gore.
My idea of a groovy Friday
night. Everything w ent fine,

until they let these 13- and 14year-old ruffians into the
school.
They went com pletely
nuts. Kids w ere punching
teachers, tearing apart the
exhibits and feeling up the poor
girl on the alien autopsy table.
Needless to say, my friend was
not amused. All the student
council supervisor could say
was, “Kids will be kids.” Yeah,
I suppose so, if these kids are
the Children of the Damned!
The scene made me really
ponder the idea o f wanting to
contribute to the problem by
procreating any time soon.
I rem em ber Halloween
when I was that young. I would
be w earing som e hokey
costum e, usually som ething
uncomfortably warm, like one
of those plastic masks that
increase the tem perature in
your head to 450 degrees.
But, we had fun. We pulled
pranks which w ere harmless
enough. Come on, it’s not all
that hard to clean Vaseline out
from under a car door handle.
Now, 10-year-olds are
dressed as the Spice Girls. I’m
sure if I hand out candy on
Saturday, there will be some
young men dressed up as
pimps.
“Oh, isn’t little Cameron
just darling in his purple fur
coat. His little sister was going
to dress up as one of his tricks,
but she went as Sporty Spice
instead.”
I just hope I don’t get shot
over a couple of Milky Ways.

From the beginning it was apparent that
this w asn’t going to be your average concert. A
peculiar crowd stood in a line that began at the
entrance to the Galaxy and swung around the
building to the parking lot. These weren't the
usual suspects. There were straight kids from
the suburbs, their parents and even their
grandparents. Professionals who came straight
from work. Fans aged 10 to 65 years old packed
the club to see the neo-swing band Cherry
Poppin' Daddies last Tuesday.
The band was touring in support of their
latest album Zoot Suit Riot, the Swingin' Hits
of the Cherry Poppin’ Daddies, a compilation of
their first three albums.
For those who have not seen a swing band
perform, there is just one word to describe it:
fun. The music is fast-paced and the musicians
are even more fast-paced.
Daddies’ founder and front man Steve
Perry danced like some of us kids had never
seen. The supercharged Perry didn't miss a beat
— jumping, doing mid-air splits, swinging his
hips and thrusting his pelvis.

Throughout all the movement he kept a big
cheesy grin on his face and recited all of the
lyrics. Just watching Perry was enough to wear
a person out.
The rest of the band — all six or seven of
them — were amusing to watch as well. Blaring
trumpets, trombones, saxophones, guitar, bass
and drums backed up Perry. The band even
used 1940s-style microphones.
The music was exceptional. During certain
songs, a ska influence was present whereas with
others it seemed as though they were
performing a Broadway musical.
Fortunately the show was good because
other factors involved were less than pleasant.
The show was originally scheduled to be at the
American Theater, a larger venue with seats in
good view of the stage. Fans paid $21.75 apiece
to see a show at the Galaxy, where most shows
are a mere $6. The Galaxy is a dark, smaller
club and the stage faces a wall. There is little
room for fans to swing dance. This setup may
work for bands that aren’t as popular as the
Daddies but most fans had at least a partially
obstructed view.
Opening for the D addies were the
Pietasters. The Pietasters were a fun, swinging
band as well.

WHACK W E RIGHT WING FOR GOOD
Remember Michael Moore?
For those of you who don’t,
Moore was the m astermind
behind the lamentably short-lived
TV news magazine “TV Nation.”
From 1994-95, Moore’s
militia of fellow Flint, Mich.,
residents ran roughshod over
political and economic events on
prime-time network television. If
you don’t remember the man who
sent a gay m en’s choir to
serenade a sleeping Jesse Helms
and tried to help get big
government off our backs by
closing down federally funded
highways and nursing homes in
Newt Gingrich’s hometown, you
should get to know him now.
M oore, who lived every
journalist’s dream by exposing
the hypocrisy of politics and
poking fun at everything else, is
turning to more or less straight
political activism in light of
President
C linton’s
recent
political troubles.
“All the public polls — New
York Times, Wall Street Journal,
CNN — have said the same thing
over and over: The American
public
does
NOT
want
impeachment. Yet, Congress has
decided to tell the public to take a
flying (deleted) and has moved
ahead with the impeachment
process anyway,” Moore said.
He added, “This is their fatal

mistake, and it will be their
undoing.”
A politically neutral voter,
Moore calls for an “act of civil
disobedience” in the coming
congressional election. “I wish
our members of Congress had
listened to the polls. But they
haven’t. So, now we have to
make them listen to the other
polls, the only ones they
understand — the polls that are
filled with voting booths on Nov.
3,” Moore said.
Through an e-mail-writing
campaign,
M oore
urges
Americans to vote straight
Democrat tickets, though not
because the Democratic Party is a
better alternative.
“Yes, most of the Democrats
suck,” Moore proclaimed in a
recent missive to members of his
mailing list. “I rarely vote for the
sorry, wishy-washy losers. But
this election is not about how I
feel about them — it’s about us
using them to whack the right
wing for good.” In this, Moore hopes to send
a message to Washington that
people are fed up with the
religious right and the so-called
hypocritical conservatives who
“prefer a theocracy over a
democracy.”
To drive his point home,
M oore recently led a crowd
of Puritans on a march to
the front lawn of Special
Prosecutor
Kenneth
S tarr’s

house under the auspices of
teaching Starr how to conduct a
witch hunt more efficiently.
Moore makes a convincing
argument. He points out that
Newt Gingrich perjured himself
13 separate times before a
Congressional hearing about his
illegal use of campaign funds.
Also, Congressm an Bob Barr,
sponsor of the “Defense of
Marriage Act” has been married
three times and was once caught
on video tape licking whipped
cream off a woman’s breasts at a
1992 fund-raiser.
“So go into that voting booth
and participate in a legal act of
subversion.
Vote
straight
Democrat. I don’t care who the
damn Democrat is. If it’s some
liberal w u ss... if it’s a dead guy in
Chicago ... I don’t care if it’s
that little Chihuahua dog on the
Taco Bell commercial — if he’s
on the ballot as a Democrat, pull
the lever!”

Orson Wells* cinematic masterpiece “Touch oS Evil" was
recently re-released in it’s original Sorm and is showing
at the Tivoli theater on Delmar in St. Louis.

5♦

This 1958 film was the last one Wells was
allowed to direct in the United States. Wells
turned his version in to Universal Studios, and
the studio recut the film and much was taken
out. Wells was distraught at the destruction of
his hard work, and he wrote a passionate 58page memo to the studio begging that the film
be changed back to his specifications. When the
studio refused, Wells couldn’t bear to see the
final cut of the film, and he never watched it.
The film in the theaters now is a recut
version true to Wells original vision, based on
the memo he wrote suggesting changes. The
film is much different than the 1958 version
found in video stores. They almost seem like
two different pictures.
The film stars Charlton Heston, who was
one of the big stars in Hollywood in 1958.
Wells became director when Heston was told
there was no director for the film yet and he
suggested Orson Wells, a Hollywood outsider
and character actor. Wells was then hired to
direct and play Heston’s nemesis in the film,
which was meant to be a B-grade film.
Wells used a lot of symbolism in this film,
and some critics argue that the film is
actually a symbolic representation of Welles’
own inner conflicts.

W hat sets this movie apart is the camera
work Wells employed. The film begins with
possibly the most famous opening shot in
cinematic history. A bomb is seen being planted
in a car, and the camera pulls back as an
unsuspecting couple get in and drive up the
street, never quite passing a couple walking
along beside it in the traffic. The camera shot
glides up and down, weaving through the traffic
and around buildings with remarkable ease for
three straight minutes, until the car blows up,
setting in motion the narrative of the film.The
studio heads were bewildered by Wells’ film,
and even after recutting it, they thought it was a
loser. The film was not widely released and was
quickly forgotten until film historians
rediscovered it years later as being the
masterwork it is. Because of the initial failure of
the film, Wells was never again allowed to
direct in this country. He was washed up at 42.
Wells is remembered today as being one of
the greatest film directors ever. “Citizen Kane”
is nearly unanimously hailed as being the best
film ever made, even though few people saw it
in 1941. “Touch o f Evil” stands alongside
“Citizen Kane” in terms o f beauty and
innovation. Both films provide rare glimpses of
how great cinema can be, and one can’t help but
w onder what more W ells could have
accomplished if he had been given the chance.

T he tw o things th e S IU E m e n ’s soccer te a m h a s n ’t do n e with
consistency this y e ar is score goals and win close gam es. B u t they
m anaged to d o b o th this w eekend to gain tw o victories and a spot
in the co n feren ce to u rn a m en t.
B efo re this w e e k e n d ’s contests S IU E w as well below a 1.5
goals p e r g am e average, b u t an 8-1 th rash in g o f K entucky
W esleyan C ollege changed that.
T he C o u g ars w ere relentless for all 90 m in u tes as th ey po u red
on th e offense.

F reshm en Justin H u n ek e and Scott T aylor each had two goals
— one in each half o f play.
“I t ’s nice to see freshm en get goals because it gives them m ore
confidence,” h ead coach E d H u n ek e said. “ It helps w hen your
underclassm en are m ore productive in th e stretch ru n .”
S enior M att L ittle also scored a p air o f goals to add to his
team -high to tal for the season.

In S u n d ay ’s m atch against B ellarm ine College, S IU E was

To play or not to play
T h e re is big new s com ing o u t of
H ighland H eights, Ky.
This is th e h o m e of N o rth e rn K entucky
U niversity w hich is in o u r G re a t Lakes
Valley C onferen ce.
T he new s is th a t a fem ale basketball
p lay er has b e e n dism issed fro m th e team
b ecause th e coach has deem ed th a t she

D is ru p tio n o f th e te am is usually
g rounds e n o u g h fo r dism issal, b u t th ere is
a su b p lo t to th is story.
The p lay er in q u estion is a lesbian. The
player w as n o t dism issed from the team
until th e coach fo u n d o u t she is a lesbian.
T he p lay er h as now filed a law suit
seeking an unspecified am o u n t of m oney

a n d re in s ta te m e n t to th e te a m . T he
u n iv e rsity
p re sid e n t
is
sta n d in g
b eh in d the coach.
U n iv e rsity
officials
a re
doing
ev erything to cover th eir bu tt. T hey are
k eep in g th e w om an on scholarship, just
n o t letting h er be p a rt o f the team . Since a
sc h o o l c a n ’t d isc rim in ate b e c a u se of
sexual o rie n ta tio n they are saying she
d isru p ts team chemistry.
B u t w ait, th e re is a su b p lo t to the
su bplot. It has now com e o u t th a t the
w om an in question had a relationship with
a n o th e r player on the team .
So m ight th is have c a u se d a
d istra c tio n ? W h at if th e c o u p le w ere
having a fight? W ould it carry o v er to the

locker room o r o n to th e co urt? A n d w hat

W ould
th e y
fe el
u n c o m fo rta b le

This case will o p e n up a huge can of
worms. This isn ’t th e kind of press th a t a
university wants.
T he story has alread y b e en on E SPN
and it is far from over. This is n o t a cut and
d ried case. Sure, p eo p le deserve the right
to play sports regardless o f race, religion
or sexual o rien tatio n . I firm ly believe that.
This case rem inds m e of a few years ago
