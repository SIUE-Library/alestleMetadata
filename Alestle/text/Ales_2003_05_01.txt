Chancellor readying SIUE STOP halts protest
for possible budget deficit meetings until fall
A l e stl e S ta ff R e p o r t

Chancellor David W erner
said increased income will soften
the blow o f state budget cuts, but
SIUE will still be forced to
decrease spending by $1.5
million next year.
Gov.
Rod
Blagojevich
recommended an 8.237 percent
cut in state universities’ budgets,
which translates to $5.64 million
for SIUE. With salary increases
that have already been negotiated
and an expected increase of
m inimum wage for student

employees added to that, SIUE
will have to compensate for a
$7.29 million budget shortfall.
W erner said he expects
income from tuition to increase
about $4.8 million because of
increased
enrollm ent
and
uncapping tuition rates.
Tuition for in-state students
is $112 per hour. Last year,
students paid only $85 for every
hour over 12. But the Southern
Illinois U niversity board of
trustees plans to uncap tuition,
making all hours $112, including
hours over 12.

Werner said he also plans to
use about $1 million of non-state
money to cover som e o f the
university’s administrative costs.
N on-state m oney com es from
income from other university
departm ents, excluding those
related to instruction.
The remaining $1.5 million
Werner said would come from his
and the four vice chancellors’
budgets.
None of the budget cuts are
set. The state budget must still be
passed by the Illinois General
Assembly before it takes effect.

International students are now
being monitored by new system

System
began
Tuesday and is to be completed
by the end of the week.
According to the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization
Service’s Web site, SEVIS
“provides tracking, monitoring
and access to accurate and
current
inform ation
on
nonim m igrant
students
and
exchange visitors.”
Toni Liston, adviser to
SIU E’s International Student
Services, is already grieved with
the new monitoring process.
“The university is supposed
to help the student, yet we have to
report them,” Liston said.
In a U.S. House immigration
hearing April 2, Johnny Williams,
interim director for Immigration
Interior Enforcement Bureau of
Im m igration
and
Custom s
Enforcem ent D epartm ent of
Homeland Security, said, “SEVIS

Members o f Students and Teachers Organized for Peace meet in the

semester. Members will remain active and likely resume meetings in
the fall.

enhances our ability to detect and
deter those who may come to
America for nefarious purposes,
while extending a hand in
friendship to those seeking the
exceptional
education
and
training opportunities this great
country has to offer.”
Liston sees the program as
anything but a friendly hand.
“There have been cases of
students being arrested and taken

in due to computer error,” Liston
said. No SIUE students have
been arrested.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch
reported
April
7
that
a
W ashington U niversity student
temporarily lost his student status
when the database w ouldn’t
allow the school to access his file.
T hat glitch could have
resulted in his deportment.
see SEVIS, page 2

Students
and
Teachers
Organized for Peace have been
meeting every Wednesday since
the fall sem ester and have
met this week for the last time
this semester.
Graduate student in the
Sociology
D epartm ent
and
coordinator for STOP Paula
Kelso
said
although
the
group will not meet over the
summer, they will still remain
active.
A lso, d ep en d in g on the
w ar situation, the group will
continue to meet in the fall.
Kelso also mentioned STOP
is not only concerned with the
w ar with Iraq, but also with
various other peace issues.
“This organization is not
ju st for the current war. It is

also
a
social
ju stice
organization,” she said.
Since STOP began meeting
in the fall, each rally has a varied
number of participants.
A ccording to sociology
professor John Farley the greatest
num ber o f participants at a
vigil has been about 75 while
others have only brought out a
few.
Farley said the num ber of
participants likely reflects how
much advertising was done
for STOP and whether posters or
fliers were put up on campus.
Regarding w hat the group
hopes to accomplish by meeting
on a weekly basis, Farley said,
“It’s kind of a way to make
a statement that this war with Iraq
isn't appropriate.”
For m ore inform ation on
STOP activities, e-mail Kelso at

The next Alestle will be Wednesday, May 28.

Have a great summer!

Williams addressed the issue
o f com puter glitches with
assurance
“that
any
such
problem s shall be addressed
immediately,
aggressively
and professionally.”
Liston said the problem was
corrected after students spent a
night in jail.
Liston said she sees things
from the students’ perspective.
The
welcom e
the
governm ent
is
giving
international students, she said, is
restrictions and the knowledge
that
the
governm ent
is
w atching every
m ove the
students make.
She said students have had
to deal with not only coming to a
foreign country and a new
school,
but
w ith
getting
fingerprinted and dealing with
the government’s inflexibility.
According to L iston, the
governm ent used to allow
the
school
to
determ ine
the legitimacy of undergraduate
students dropping below 12
credit hours or graduate students
dropping below nine.
Now,
the
governm ent
has
largely
taken
that
consideration
out
of
the
university’s hands.
“There are four or five

and was a kid’s club coach.

Legion in Edwardsville.

reasons a person can drop below
full-time status,” Liston said.
Students could drop a class
and keep their student visas
if they are new to the United
States and adjusting with reading
or writing English.
Students m ight also take
fewer hours for medical reasons,
or if it is their last semester and
less than the number of credit
hours required for full-time status
is needed to graduate or if
they are mistakenly placed in an
inappropriate class by an adviser.
Liston
said
these
new regulations are very limiting
to students who may be
trying hard in a class but are
incapable of obtaining a passing
grade.
For graduate students, the
situation is more tense.
Since graduate students
cannot make below a B, failing a
course is not an option.
If graduate students begin to
fail their courses, they must
withdraw
from
class
and
apply for reinstatem ent if
they drop below full-time status.
During
the
processing
period, which can take anywhere
from three to five months,
graduate students cannot have a
job.

“The students are extremely
discouraged. Som e are telling
family not to come (to the United
States) and are pulling out,”
Liston said.
The governm ent expected
this program to help schools.
“In
an
age
where
inform ation is key, SEVIS is
a source o f timely and accurate
inform ation fo r educational
institutions and governm ent
agencies,” according to the
federal
Web
site
www.immigration.gov.
However,
International
Student Services has already
begun to see problem s with
the system.
The
governm ent
had
promised a one-day turnaround
on processing the information
sent in by the schools. Yet, this
is not the case.
International
Student
Services
did
not
receive
the inform ation
W ednesday
morning that it sent to the
governm ent Tuesday, although
the office received it later in the
day.
“This is not a bad thing, per
se,”
D ebbie
B ayne
of
International Student Services
said. “It’s a problem on their
end.”

Counseling Services at SIUE
is offering helpful tips and
reminders to students as finals
week rapidly approaches.
Counseling
Services
suggests students should make a
general schedule o f their finals
and studying times.
Students should avoid late

night studying.
It is helpful to calmly review
materials and then get a good
night’s sleep.
Other suggestions include
not
panicking
or
getting
too nervous before an exam,
arriving on time for exams, not

worrying if other people finish
more quickly and following the
rules of good exam taking.
D irector o f Counseling

“The best advice we can give
students is to set up a schedule for
studying for finals. D on’t stress,
and don’t w ait until the last
minute. Procrastination is our
worst enemy.”
Counseling Services will
be open norm al hours during

Nominees
for
teaching
awards in the College of Arts and
Sciences
were
recognized
Wednesday, April 23.
Five teachers were honored
during a reception for the
nominees and award winners of
the CAS Teaching Excellence
Award.
At the beginning of the
event, Dean Kent Neely shared a
few words on what it means
to receive and even be nominated
for the school-wide awards.
A Teaching
Excellence
award is the highest-know n
recognition for teachers within
the university level.
The teachers picked for the
nominations were chosen based
on their teaching excellence,
as
seen
by
their
peers
in education.
Those
represented
were biology professor Paul

Brunkow, public administration
and policy analysis professor
Dennis Hostetler, math professor
Steve Rigdon, history professor
Allison
Thom ason
and
philosophy professor Robert
Ware.
Brunkow also won the
Teacher’s Recognition Award.
Hostetler won the T eacher’s
Excellence Award for his work
in the public adm inistration
graduate program and in bringing
interactive Web teaching to
SIUE.
Most of them worked to get
the students involved, as well as
to open up their subjects as
an area of interest to the people
they taught.
Nominee Allison Thomason
shared her enthusiasm for history.
“I try to help (students) relate
the ancient arcana to m odem
day,” Thomason said.
Brunkow added, “Getting
students involved really makes a
difference.”

Q

Well, we finally made it
through another semester. And
for the nearly 1,500 who are
graduating, I congratulate you.
For those of us who have to
hang around another semester or
another year or more, hang in
there, we too will make it.
I wish everyone a safe, fun
and productive summer. I’ll still
be here for a bit finishing up a
couple of classes and counting on
taking my walk in August. But
my gig is over at the Alestle.
I started my tenure as editor

entails, while balancing it with
school work and home life.
I was thrust headlong into
the position with the first order of
business being to publish the 64page Back to School Survival
Guide.
Without having that summer
cushion to get used to all the
operations of the Alestle, a lesser
person would have quit in
August. However, I am blessed
to be made of the tough stuff.
I made sure the BSSG got
onto the newsstands, as well as
the other 58 editions, and now my
time is up, and I can go on to
bigger and better things prepared
to face new challenges because I
was here.
I could not have done it
without help though, and for all
of you who had my back and
inspired me, I thank you. I want
to thank the Creator for giving
me the strength to do the job to
the best of my ability.

Thanks to Desiree Bennyhoff and
Nicole Gaudreault, my right and left
hands, respectively... ”

L etters to the editor po lio :

in chief of the Alestle in August
by saying I thought having the
opportunity was priceless.
Much has happened since
then, and although I would not
trade the experience for anything,
I certainly view it differently.
I am the only editor in recent
history who has not had the
benefit of starting in the summer
semester.
In fact, potential
editors have been dissuaded from
applying,
encouraged
to
withdraw their applications or
sim ply denied the position if
situations prohibited them from
taking over during the summer.
Starting the job o f editor in
chief during the summer certainly
has its advantages.
Sum m er
semesters tend to be slower with
not as much new s to cover.
Student organizations are not as
active, and there are fewer people
on campus. The newspaper itself
is smaller, only eight pages as
opposed to the 12-, 16-, and 20page papers of the fall and spring
sem esters.
In addition, the
Alestle is published twice weekly
in fall and spring but only once a
week during summer.
This is designed to give the
new editor a chance to ease into
the position and get accustomed
to all his or her duties of
managing time and personnel,
writing colum ns, layout and
design and public relations, as
well as everything else the job

to Desiree Bennyhoff and Nicole

I thank colum nist Jon R.

write those biting columns every
week. Thanks to former Photo
Editor Cathy C rater for her
commitment to excellence during
my absence due to illness last

Dear Editor,
I can’t possibly express my
relief upon reading that illegal
pudding sales have been curtailed
at Union Station.
It’s a further relief to know
that in a nation currently
occupying two different countries
(Iraq and Afghanistan), the crack
team of journalists at the Alestle
went out on a limb to cover this
breaking story, no doubt in the
face of ridicule from their peers.
Imagine
receiving
harassment from people covering
less important stories such as the
shrinking budget for higher
education, and a m ulti-billion
dollar bond am ount against

tobacco companies which was
determ ined
right
here
in
Edwardsville.
Congratulations to the team
who had the courage to put the
illegal pudding story on page one.
It’s just a pity that it was placed
below the fold so more people
won't see the aw ard-w inning
journalism practiced here at
SIUE.
If you w ant to be taken
seriously as a newspaper, write
serious stories. If you want to be
taken as a joke, write more illegal
pudding sales stories.

History

Pike's piece not honest jou rnalism
Dear Editor,
I apologize, but I have to
take Mr. Pike to task about his
blatant m isreporting of almost
everything he said in his April 15
column.
He talks about the death of
Rachel Corrie, the “ Saint of
Rafiah.”
The truth is Mr. Pike, she
was brainwashed. Yes, I will use
that word by the M uslim Student
Association she joined while she
was at Evergreen C ollege in
Olympia, Washington.
Before the lot of you start
calling me the next McCarthy, let
me explain why.
This student association is
funded by Saudis, our supposed
friends.
A ccording to an
insightful article from townhall
dot com, this organization has
routinely invited pro-terrorist
speakers to spread their filth on
impressionable students, such as
Hamid Ayloush, a representative

of the Holy Land Foundation, an
organization that funds Al-Qaeda.
Rachel Corrie was one of these
college students whose mind was
poisoned by this garbage, where
the main talking points stress the
grand Zionist conspiracy and the
evil Western imperialists.
I am not excusing her death,
I am merely stating that there
should be some pause here.
Just what is the point of
having
radical
Islam ist
organizations on a college that
encourage violence?
Jon Pike opens his article
with the slug line, “Israel-more
crimes against humanity” so I
shall end my letter with
Jon Pike - more crimes against
intelligence.
All I ask for is honest
reporting.
Sincerely,
Tim Morris
Senior
Arts and Sciences

Inspiration does not go unnoticed
The other day I was talking
to one of the people I look up to
most in journalism and I realized
I have more in common with him
than I had previously thought.
SIUE English professor and
Poet Laureate of East St. Louis
Eugene B. Redmond and I both
developed a passion for reading
and writing at an early age.
Redmond said he always had
a love for reading, but the first
time he wrote for exposure was
what he referred to as “puppy
love” songs he penned as a teen
for a neighborhood doo-wop
singing group.
As a teen, I wrote a play for
my neighborhood friends they
performed in a talent show.
Although he w rote for
Lincoln
High
S chool’s

newspaper, The M irror and I
never wrote for my alma m ater’s
Redbird Word, we both started
our
serious
w riting
after
becoming adults.
He said he began writing
professionally whenever he had
downtime in the U.S. Marines.
He wrote for some of the military
base newspapers.
I wrote grants and requests
for
proposals
on
various
including for the American Red
Cross and the A lton Housing
Authority.
We both had a significant
break in our education and began
our
college
years
as
nontraditional students.
We each found our way

journal, the Annual Literary
Supplement, of which he was a
frequent contributor.
During Redmond’s terms as
news reporter, news editor and
editor in chief, he covered the
Civil Rights events of the ’60s
and the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy.
He covered the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech
at the famed
M arch
on
Washington not only for the
Alestle, but for a number of black
weeklies.
Redmond said among the
sim ilarities
are
“achieving
representation,
addressing
student apathy and dealing with
varied
public
opinion
on
controversial topics,” his during
the struggle for civil rights and
mine with the war in Iraq.

I still have so much to which
I can aspire when I look at
Redmond’s track record.
Besides being an English
professor , he is the founder of a
w riter’s club nam ed for him,
author of Drumvoices Revue, a
poetry journal and a personal
friend of poet Maya Angelou and
journalist and talk show host
Oprah Winfrey.
Redmond

Classical music lovers gathered into Katherine
Dunham Hall Theater at 7:30 p.m. Monday for the
SIUE Wind Sym phony and Concert Band
performances.
The show opened with the concert band’s
rendition of Latham’s “Brighton Beach,” followed
by Giovanni’s “Overture in B flat.”
The concert band wrapped up its performance
with a piece arranged for military band, Holst’s
“Moorside March.”
Conductors for this portion o f the show
included Gary Beamon, a retiree of the United
States M arine Corps, M atthew Hoormann, a
graduate teaching assistant, and SIUE Director of
Bands John Bell.
Bell praised the Concert Band and thanked it
for the time and effort put into the year’s musical
performances.
Next, the Wind Sym phony came out and
performed four pieces, conducted by Bell and guest
conductor Robert Boedges. Works perform ed
included von Suppe’s “Morning, Noon and Night in
Vienna,” R odrigo’s “A dagio” and Persichetti’s
“Divertimento.”
It also played the fourth m ovement from

H indem ith’s
“M arch
from
Sym phonic
M etamorphosis,” of which Bell said, “Hold on to
your seats; this one really goes.”
Boedges, the guest conductor, is director of
bands at Collinsville High School and has dabbled
in all sorts of musical endeavors, including concert
band, jazz band, marching band and orchestra, as
well as having instructed music theory, jazz theory
and musical theater.
He has been instructing instrumental music for
39 years, and during that time, has received
many awards for his work, including a recent
appearance in W ho’s Who Among Am erican
Teachers.
Audience m em ber freshman Katy Adams
spoke positively about the show.
“I enjoyed the concert. My favorite piece was
the last one (Hindemith’s “March”) because it was
very fast paced and exciting,” Adams said.
The members of the Wind Symphony are
scheduled to perform June 29 in New York’s
Carnegie Hall. The musicians will depart for New
York June 26, where they will lodge in the Grant
H yatt Hotel near Grand Central Station. The
concert repertoire will include Hindemith’s “March
from
Sym phonic
M etam orphosis”
and
Rodrigo’s “Adagio.” The band is set to return
June 30.

The first summer action movie
will hit theaters Friday. "X-Men 2:
X-Men United” is an action
packed, nonstop adrenaline rush.
In the sequel to the 2001 hit,
mutants continue their struggle
against a society of humans who
fear them. After an assassination
attempt on the president by a
mutant known as Nightcrawler,
there is a public outcry for an
anti-m utant m ovem ent led by
William Stryker (Brian Cox).
Wolverine (H ugh Jackm an),
returns to X avier’s mansion, after
a long period of soul searching,
just in time to save the mutants
from Stryker’s attack.
M agneto (Ian M cKellen),
imprisoned after the first film,
escapes and forms a partnership
with the X-M en to stop their
common enemy, Stryker.
The film’s action sequences are
fast paced and well directed by the
first film’s director, Brian Singer.
A fter
the
first
film,
moviegoers might find it hard to
get excited about the sequel. Too
many characters were left out
from the comic, such as, Beast,
Gambit and Colossus. In the
second film, only Nightcrawler
appears, but the characters’
personal lives are more heavily
focused on, which adds to the
enjoyment of the film.
Iceman, played by Shawn

Ashm ore, agonizes with the
decision to tell his family that he
is a mutant. He also yearns for a
relationship with Rogue, played
by Anna Paquin.
The audience learns about
Logan’s past, better known as
Wolverine, who basically carried
the first film. In the sequel,
W olverine again is the main
attraction, and rightfully so; he is
the biggest and m ost vicious
killer of all the X-Men.
Other cast members shine in
the sequel as well. Halle Berry,
who plays Storm, delivers a fine
supporting perform ance and
R ebecca
Rom ijn-Stam os
is
entertaining to watch as the evil
but beautiful Mystique.
W hile
the
characters’
personas are touched upon a lot
more in the sequel, action is still
the name of the game for “X-2.”
The battle
scenes are
fabulous to watch, namely the
showdown betw een Wolverine
and Deathstrike, in a fight to the
death.
Viewing the first film is not
necessary before seeing the
sequel; nor is being a comic
book fan. “X-2” is the first of
many summer action movies to
hit theaters and it is definitely
going to set the standards high for
the other film s. “X -2” is an
all around great action film that
is perfect for the summer movie
season.

Korte Stadium will be the site for GLVC and NCAA meets
S ta c e y R a im a
S ports S tringf .r

Ralph Korte Stadium will
play host to the Great Lakes
Valley Conference Track and
Field Championships May 8 and
9, featuring seven schools vying
fo r
the
title
of
GLVC
cham pion.
This year’s conference meet
is the fourth in seven years to be at
SIUE.
The meet will be even more
special to the Cougar athletes who
get the chance to compete at the
national level on their home
track.
The venue, which served as
the site for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Division II
Track and Field Championships in
1997, 1998 and 2000, will also be
the
site
of
this
year’s
championships May 22 through
24.
The meets should prove to be
two of the most contested meets
of the season.
Korte Stadium was built in
1994 at a cost of $5.5 million.
Funded through both public and
private resources, the stadium was
built by the collaboration of the
community, the university and
outside entities. The stadium was

named after Ralph Korte, an
alumnus and entrepreneur who
has given generously to
SIUE over the years.
His
company,
Korte
Construction
Co., was responsible
for the erection of the
stadium nearly nine
years ago.
Located on the southwest
comer of SIUE’s
campus
on
Stadium
Road, Korte
Stadium is
e a s i l y
accessible
f r o m
surrounding
areas and conveniently located only
20 minutes from downtown St.
Louis. The stadium features an
eight-lane, 400-meter balsam
surface track, as well as a 73-by120-yard soccer field.
Four banks o f 37-by-42-foot
lights mounted on 100-foot poles
light up the night sky for evening
events at the stadium.
The stadium is a tri-level
structure with a seating capacity
of 3,000. It contains locker rooms,
public restrooms, training room
facilities, V IP skyboxes, a
concession
stand,
storage

m «¿W M L mm
facilities,
a television coverage platform
and a public address system. On
the south end of the complex is a
40-by-96-foot matrix scoreboard
that stays lighted nearly year round.
Korte Stadium is used
primarily for track and field
events. With space for four longjump and triple-jump pits, two
high-jump pits, three javelin
runways, four pole-vault runways
and four throw ing rings, the
stadium has proven to be one of
the most versatile arenas in the
country.

Cougar softball prepares for big weekend
A m y G rant
A s s is t a n t S p o r t s E d it o r

With the regular season
concluded, the softball team will
siart its run at the Great Lakes
Valley Conference Championship
this weekend at home.
Ten games are scheduled for
Friday with the first game
b e.;:;. .-..g at 9 a.m. at Cougar
Field and alternate games being
pin ed at the Edwardsville High
School varsity field.
“Playing at home is always a
good
thing,
especially
academically at this time of the
year,”
head
coach
Sandy
Montgomery said. “We hope to
draw a great crowd like we had at
regionals last year to really give
our team a boost.”
As the No. 1 seed, SIUE is
slated to meet No. 8 St. Joseph’s
College at 11 a.m. Friday. If SIUE
wins, it will go on to face the
winner of the University of
Southern Indiana versus Bellarmine
University contest at 3 p.m.
The Cougars are coming off a
strong week, in which they

increased their winning streak to
seven games. The team has won
18 of 20 contests while finishing
the regular season with a 17-3
conference record and a 39-9
overall record.
Additionally,
sophomore
shortstop V.J. Schmidt has been
named the Co-GLVC Player of
the Week and freshman pitcher
Mary Heather White has been
honored as the Co-GLVC Pitcher
of the Week.
Schmidt, who shares the
honor with Southern Indiana
junior
catcher
Kristen
Houseworth, finished last week
with a batting average of .524
with 11 hits, six runs and six
RBIs. She also went ll-for-21
and was flawless in handling 19
plays in the field.
“V.J. has been outstanding
this year,” M ontgom ery said.
“She’s hitting the ball well and is
the best shortstop in the
conference in my opinion.”
White shares Pitcher of the
Week recognition with Southern
Indiana junior pitcher Shannon
Emmons after recording three

The center of the track holds
Bob Guelker Field, which was
named after a Hall of Famer
who coached soccer at
SIUE from 1967 to 1985.
The field is the home of
the SIUE soccer teams.
Korte

christening event was the
1994 Olympic Festival with
professional athletes such as
Vonetta Flowers,
A n t o n i o
Pettigrew,
D a r r i n
Steele and
J a c k i e
JoynerK e r s e e
participating
at the track.
Korte Stadium has continued
to play host to such prestigious
events as the Prairie State Games,
the State Games of America, the
National Junior College Athletic
Association All-Star Track and
Field M eet and the NJCAA
National Championships.
Other events include the U.S.
Junior Nationals, a U.S. versus
Germany decathlon dual meet,
U.S.
Youth

Cham pionships, Golden Spike
Tour, Senior Olympics and
Special Olympics.

wins spanning 17 innings with a
0.82 ERA.
With the wins, the righthanded hurler improved her
overall record to 9-1 after winning
nine straight games.
Junior outfielder Jenny Esker
is another Cougar who has stood
out in the GLVC this season.
She is leading the team with a
.457 batting average, 44 runs, 69
hits, nine hom e runs and 45
RBIs.
Esker is 14 hits shy of
breaking her own school record of
83 hits in a season.
If the future is any reflection
of the past, the Cougars don’t
have a lot to worry about.
SIUE has swept the St.
Joseph’s Pumas in all three games
the two teams have played this
season, including a 3-2 win
March 12 in the St. Leo
Tournament and 11-5 and 13-1
wins in the doubleheader Sunday
on the road.
“I don’t expect us to outscore
them like we did Sunday,”
Montgomery said. “We’ve won
three games against them this
see SOFTBALL, page 14

Korte Stadium was also the
site for a world-class farewell
meet for local track star JackieJoyner Kersee.
It is no doubt what lies inside
Korte Stadium is a major part of
this premier sports arena, but what
lies outside the stadium adds to its
uniqueness as well.
Practice soccer fields are
located behind the main bleachers,
and a 1,000-space parking lot
provides more than enough room
for fans, athletes and officials to
park.
Adjacent parking is available
for overflow of more than 5,000.
Scenic
running
trails
surround the area, as well as
Cougar Field, Roy E. Lee Field
and community soccer fields.
The SIUE track and field
teams are finishing up their seasons
while many local citizens are taking
advantage of the warm spring
weather by utilizing the track or
flying kites behind the stadium.
This spring has seen a
plethora of events, including the
Cougar Classic and SIUE Twilight
track and field meets, as well as
the high school Southwestern
Illinois Relays.
Following the national meet,
the track and field teams will
conduct a summer camp, and then

Don’t rule the SIUE baseball
team out yet.
If the Cougars win their five
remaining G reat Lakes Valley
Conference contests, and the top
two teams lose all five of their
games, the Cougars could find
themselves in the upper echelon of
the GLVC at the season’s end,
putting them in position for a bid
to the National Collegiate Athletic
Association
Division
II
Tournament.
Not bad, but unlikely.
SIUE has won three of its last
five contests and is 13-12 in the
conference and 20-23 overall. One
of those wins was over the No. 1
University of Missouri-St. Louis
Rivermen, and the other two were
against the No. 2 University of
Indianapolis Greyhounds.
SIUE traveled to meet the
Quincy University Hawks for a
rescheduled
doubleheader
Wednesday. Results will be in the
next edition of the Alestle, which
will be Wednesday, May 28.
The Cougars are just a half­

game behind the Hawks for fourth
place in the GLVC. The top six
teams in the conference will
advance to the GLVC Tournament
in two weeks.
The No. 5 Cougars are
preparing for a weekend set of
games with the No. 10 Bellarmine
University Knights.
“A couple of wins would be
great,” head coach Gary Collins
said.
Collins said just because the
Knights don’t rank high in the
conference doesn’t mean they
won’t come out swinging.
“We think we should be able
to play with them,” Collins said.
“They have got some wins over
good teams in the conference. If
we don’t come to play, then we are
not going to win.”
Junior pitcher Brian Keating
will get the start Friday while
freshm en
hurlers
David
Briesacher and Kyle Jones will toe
the rubber in a doubleheader
Saturday.
Keating is 3-4 in the season
with a 2.47 ERA in nine starts.

Golf team earns bid to regionals
S t a c e y B a im a
S p o r t s S t r in g e r

The women’s golf team is
heading to the post season as a
team for the first time ever.
SIUE earned a spot in the
East Regional May 6 and 7 in
Findlay, Ohio.
The Cougars are seeded sixth
of six teams. SIUE will join Grand
Valley State University, Ferris
State University, Longwood
University, the University of
Indianapolis
and
N orthern
Kentucky University to play on a
course more than 1,000 yards
longer than what SIUE is used to
playing on.
“The longer course could be
to our advantage,” coach Larry
Bennett said. “I’ve talked to some
people who have played on it, and
they said it is a great course. We
should do well.”
Even though SIUE is the
sixth seed, Bennett said he is not
worried about going into the
tournament as the underdog.
“We are just excited to have
made it,” Bennett said. “These
girls have worked hard for this, and
anything can happen in regionals.
Some schools may look beyond us
because of our seed number, but
we will have the advantage in that
we can play relaxed because we
have nothing to lose.”
In order to advance to
nationals, the Cougars will need to
finish in the top two, which
Bennett believes the team is more

than capable.
“We will have to play at our
best in order to advance from the
regional,” Bennett said. “The hard
work the girls have put in this season
makes that more than possible.”
At press time, Bennett was
unsure of which lineup would be
making the trip to Findlay.
“Some of my girls are
arranging to take finals early in
order to go to the tournament,”
Bennett said. “This dedication
only adds to the good work ethic
of the team.”
Bennett said Katie Farrell
will definitely be attending the
tournament not only in team play,
but in individual play as well.
Farrell most recently finished
in 20th place at the Mini Classic.
She leads the team with an 84.2
scoring average.
“Last season, Katie went to
the tournament as an individual,
but this year our whole team is
going,” Bennett said. “It will be
nice to have the whole team there
to support her. Any team member
playing in the team competition is
also eligible to advance as an
individual.”
The Cougars will also be
pulling for Farrell to advance to
nationals. The nationals will take
place two weeks after the
regional.
Other Cougars who could
possibly make appearances on the
regional roster are junior Beth
Gumbel, junior Brittany Auld and
freshman Brittany Hood.

to make some changes. But if
we’re on, it could happen.”
Of the eight teams in the
tournament,
only
Lewis
University
and
Northern
Kentucky University were able to
defeat SIUE.
Lewis won the first game of a
doubleheader 2-1 April 19, and
NKU won the second game of a
doubleheader 8-5 March 30.
As a team, the Cougars are
outscoring opponents in many
categories. The team has a .308
batting average, 264 runs, 381 hits
and 228 RBIs, com pared to
opponents’ .201 average, 94 runs,
228 hits and 81 RBIs.
Even though they’ve had
success this season, Montgomery
doesn’t take anything from the
regular
season
once
the

in d

tournament starts.
“We don’t really look at what
we did during the regular season
anymore,” Montgomery said.
“Right now we just see it as a
two-game season, and we have to
win those two games in order to
move on.”
Advancing will partially
depend on the performance of
senior pitcher RyAnn Spann.
Spann has a record of 22-5
with a 1.54 ERA, 109 hits, 37
earned runs and 169 strikeouts.
The Cougars’ performance in
the tournament will seal their bid
in the National Collegiate Athletic
A ssociation’s Tournam ent in
May.

2 with a 3.31 ERA while Jones has
been roughed up with a 1-2 record
and an 8.10 ERA.
Collins said as good as these
pitchers may be, it still takes runs
to win ballgames.
“You have to look at runs
scored, and we don’t score as
many runs because we don’t do
some things well,” Collins said.
“We just don’t make enough big
plays. We haven’t had a big
winning streak yet. We had high
expectations and are not achieving
the goals we set for ourselves.”
The Cougars have been
outscored this season 236 to 215.
SIUE will turn to sophomore
outfielder Craig Ohlau, senior first
baseman Jason Kessler and junior
utility player Wes Pickering to
lead any turnaround in the run
department.
“Ohlau,
Kessler
and
Pickering have been our most

consistent,” Collins said.
The three players have
combined for 54 runs and 83 RBIs.
Collins said getting hits this
season has been a struggle.
“We had some guys that
earlier this season didn’t hit their
weight, and that really hurt us,”
Collins said. “The second half of
the season those guys have been a
little better.”
The Cougars will take on the
Knights at 7 p.m. Friday at GMC
Stadium in Sauget.
“We are anxious to get in
there and play,” Collins said.
A doubleheader between the
two teams will then take place at
noon Saturday at Roy Lee Field.
The GLVC Tournament is
scheduled for May 9 through 11 at
the home of the No. 1 seed.
“We could (end the season)
higher with a real twist of fate,”
Collins said.

GOLF
fro m page 13
The team will place its main
focus on the regional tournament,
but excitement is already building
for next season.
Kallie Harrison signed a
national letter of intent to play for
the Cougars. Harrison hails from
D ecatur’s St. Teresa’s High
School.
“Harrison is one of the best
players in the state,” Bennett said.

“She will definitely help us to
improve our depth next year and
should make an immediate impact
on the team.
“We will be losing some
good seniors next year in Deanna
Bock and Nonie Ehlke,” Bennett
added. “However, we will have a
great roster next year and will
only keep getting better.”
