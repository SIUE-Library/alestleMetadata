Services
Departm ent of SIUE received
revenue of $519,000 this past
fiscal year from ju st parking
fines.
That equals more than
30,000 tickets in 52 weeks for the

year ending July 31. That means
an average of 576 tickets per
week. The revenue figure, by the
way, does not include all
citations, only the ones that have
been paid.

An
exhibition
of
photographs by Provost David
Sill
shows his years of
involvem ent in the artistic
experiences promoted by SIUE.
Sill, who has served as
chairm an of the Theater and
Dance Department and dean of
Fine Art and Communications, is
exhibiting photographs at the
New Wagner Art Gallery in the
Art and Design Building. The
show runs through Oct. 30.
His images, taken during
sabbatical,
are
carefully
constructed to focus on senses
and places. His work shows a
deep feeling for the places he has
visited. He senses them through
sight,
sound
and
smell,
remembering the sense of these
places in his dreams. His
collection
of
sabbatical
photographs com es from two
very different places: local, rural
Illinois and Lewes, Del.
He has used realistic focus
to present unique experiences
through
mundane
objects.
Images of trees and gravestones
becom e experienced places
through the different angles from
which he captures his scenes. He
has stressed, however, that in
following realistic tradition, his
images were created by “found
design,” implicating his innate
reliance on symmetry and angles
as well as other formal elements
of design.
Sill has structured his
responses to places in layers,
expressing many viewpoints by
employing elements of distance
and scale.

Tribute to ex-Housing official
BY ANTOINETTE BERNICH
NEWS STRINGER
A memorial scholarship has
been set up at SIUE to honor
Jam es R. A nderson, form er
associate director of University
Housing.
Anderson died o f cancer
Sept. 5 at his home in Oxford,
M iss., at the age o f 40. He

worked at- SIUE Housing from
1990 to 1997 when he left to
becom e director of Student
Housing at the U niversity of
Mississippi.
The SIUE scholarship is for
exceptional Illinois high school
students who choose to live on
campus. The specifics o f the
award will be determined by a
housing committee and members

of the Anderson family.
Anderson
m ade
many
notew orthy contributions to
SIUE during his seven years
here. He was responsible for
having the tennis courts at
Cougar Village resurfaced and
integrating new software into the
Central Housing Office.

A ccording
to
H ealth
Services, the Epstein-Barr virus,
which is known for its role in
causing
infectious
m ono­
nucleosis, is alive and well at
SIUE.
During the past m onth,
several
students
have
experienced fatigue, headaches,
loss of appetite, sore throats,
tonsillar swelling and enlarged
lymph nodes. Doctors believe
that excessive stress can play a
role in the weakening o f the
immune system , enabling the
virus to initiate mono.
This would seem to make
sense in light of the evidence.
Every year, Health Services
reports m ore cases of m ono
during the beginning o f each
semester.
These
are
characteristically
stressful
periods for college students.
It
is
estim ated
that
approxim ately 50 percent o f
students have had mono by the
time they enroll in college.
M ononucleosis
is
highly
contagious, though it rarely
causes serious, life-threatening
com plications. M ost cases o f
mono usually disappear in two to
four w eeks, but there is no
known cure.
Health Services warns that
students can contract the disease
through any type of bodily fluid.

A little history lesson Letter to the Editor
What are you?
Why do people ask me that instead of “who are
you?” I suppose it’s because “what are you” is easier to
answer. Or is it? Someone once got upset with me for
saying I was mixed with slave master. In high school that
was my response when people asked me what I was. It was
Danielle a very harsh way of saying it, but it was the truth. On both
Belton sides of my family the results of my mixed ancestry were
because of slavery and rape. I don’t think my grandmother
would lie about things like that.
As I was growing up, many of my friends in elementary school
went to great lengths to explain how they were not completely black.
That didn't make much sense to me. I knew I was black and was quite
comfortable with it. I didn’t understand why other third-graders were
so set on telling me that they were mixed with Cherokee. And everyone
always said Cherokee, as if that was the Native American group of
choice. But none of them knew anything about the Cherokee, or what
it is to be Cherokee. They didn’t know “who” the Cherokee were, they
just liked to say it, as if to say, “I’m black but I have this in me that
makes me special and different from you regular black people.”
Often I would think how I could claim the same thing. But why?
My mother’s grandmother was part Native American, but our family
has no knowledge of what tribe or how far the blood line went. It
seemed a little silly to me to go around claiming something I knew very
little about.
This continued as I grew older, but no one ever seemed to learn
“who” the Cherokees are. They didn’t leam who any of the Native
American tribes are. For many, they were simply names to just flash
when appropriate. But does anyone know what it really is to be
Cherokee? Does anyone know how when America was expanding, the
Cherokee chose to try to assimilate into the emerging Eurocentric
culture, only to still lose their land even after winning a Supreme Court
case to keep it? When Chief Justice John Marshall told President
Andrew Jackson the Cherokees had sole legal rights to their land,
Jackson told Marshall to enforce the ruling himself because as
president, he intended to ignore it. The Cherokees were eventually
forced off their land to move westward in what became the “Trail of
Tears.”
Few people I would talk to who claimed this heritage knew
anything of its culture before or after the Cherokee decided to
assimilate. But these same people would be furious when they’d see
white performers and teens appropriating black culture and music,
without acknowledging the realities of black life. Couldn’t they see
how Cherokees would take it the same way?
Many African-Americans have Native American ancestry just as
many have European ancestry. I knew plenty of black people with Irish
last names who liked to tell me how they were part Irish. But they have
never seen Ireland and know nothing about the Irish outside of St.
Patrick’s Day and Lucky Charms cereal. My family has been in this
country for more than five generations. Within that, there was plenty of
time for some playing around in the family gene pool. Who knows
what type of blood is swimming in my veins?
Therefore, “what are you?” doesn’t tell a person anything. Yet, if
you ask people who they are and deal with them from that standpoint,
you leam so much more. If people asked me who I was, I could
describe the history and culture that make me who I am , “What are
you?” only covers the biological, which tells less than half the story. I
am black, but what is black? Does it really matter if I’m a quarter this
or two parts of that? Does it matter if I’m Cherokee or not? Black is
who I am and what I am at the same time. I was bom to black parents,
then raised in an African-American culture. This has much more to do
with who I am, rather than what I am.
“What” black is, is a color. “Who” black is, is a culture, a people
and an emotion. People need to start learning who people are and stop
asking what they are. This way you can leam and understand far
greater than you could just knowing what someone is.

Letters to th e edito r policy:

The Parking Paradox
I drive my car to school and
I have an SIU parking sticker on
my back window. The sticker
allows me to park in P lots. This
is difficult because the P lots are
always full. So I cruise back and
forth along the aisles. I inch
around pickup trucks with their
rear ends sticking out until I
reach the last row in the lot. I
begin to panic because class
starts in 20 minutes and I still
face the half-mile walk to the
building.
Should I pull up on a grassy

knoll and pretend my car is a
bush? Should I drive boldly into
the quad circle disguising my car
as a bus? The roof o f my car is
not equipped with flashing
destination signals and someone
might notice, or worse, hand me a
transfer and expect a ride to
Edwardsville. Besides, I’m not in
uniform.
So I creep up and down the
aisles again. I see tail lights
flicker. Someone is backing out
and I find a space.
A question comes to mind:
Did the drivers in the occupied
spaces arrive at 4 a.m. or

have they been there since
last semester?
There is a solution to my
problem: I plan to lease one of
those giant, yellow maintenance
vehicles, the ones used all over
campus that dig holes and cut
grass. I shall drive through the
grounds past the trees and park
next to my building. I shall string
yellow tape, set out cones and go
to class.
I
need an official cap with
SIU on the bill.
