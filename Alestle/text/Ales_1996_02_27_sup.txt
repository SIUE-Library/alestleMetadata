A fte r a good recruiting year, Head Coach Gary Collins is excited about
the upcoming baseball season. With a revamped pitching s ta ff and a
number of offensive sta rs returning, Collins feels his team is ready to
compete fo r a conference championship in their firs t season as a
member of the Great Lakes Valley Conference.

Even though they only have two returning players
from last year’s team ranked 17th in the nation, the
Cougars men’s tennis team still looks strong. And
with a tough schedule, the young Cougars will be
looking for some guidance from the two returnees.

The Lady Cougars
softball team may be
young, but they know
th a t to win in the GLVC,
they have to take one
game a t a time. With
only one returning
senior, the Lady
Cougars will look for
leadership from other
players th is season.

The men’s team looks strong with an abundance of upperclassmen and
some of them should qualify fo r nationals. With the way they are running
in the indoor season, they are prepared'to run away with the outdoor
title in the GLVC. The women are young but have the determination and
drive to succeed in the GLVC.

SIUE pitching for a strong season
?y Eli Savoie
sports editor

There is an old theory in baseball th a t says the key to winning is good
pitching. If th a t theory holds true, the SIUE baseball team is in fo r a
successful season.
“ Pitching will be our biggest strength,” Cougar head coach Gary Collins
said about his revamped s ta ff th a t includes only two players from last
year’s squad.
Collins credited a good recruiting year fo r making the pitching the
team’s biggest improvement. He said th a t he didn’t have enough
scholarships before and had to use walk-on players, but now th a t the team
is in the GLVC, they have a few more scholarships to offer.
The pitching s ta ff is anchored by the two returning members,
sophomore Je ff Ridenour and senior John Mendez.
Last season, Ridenour finished with a record of 4-1 and a 2.93 ERA in
13 appearances th a t included 10 s ta rts . Mendez, on the other harfd, worked
mostly in relief and finished 1-1 with a 2.17 ERA. In their practices so far,
Collins likes what he sees from his veteran pitchers.
“The two guys we have back are throwing better than ever,” he said.
With Ridenour and Mendez to lead the staff, Collins will then look to
newcomers M a tt Clark, Ryan Cox, Eric Mumma, Mike Vogt and Jason Guest
to lend support. Collins said all of them will see time as starters, and as
many as five pitchers could compete fo r the top spot in the rotation, but
Ridenour will probably be the go-to-guy.
Also seeing time on the mound will be John Ebersohl, but Collins said
the soft-throwing lefty will be used s tric tly In relief.
With some solid pitching in place, it will be up to the Cougar offense to
score some runs to support them, and Collins doesn’t see th a t being too
much of a problem with four of the top five hitte rs from la st year returning.
“We have guys back with experience and th a t have had success,”
Collins said about the offensive attack.
The group of returning players is led by senior outfielder John
Spotanski who led the team with a .401 average last season.
“Spotanski has developed slowly, but steadily,” Collins said. “ He’s a gap h itte r and an excellent bunter.”
Although Spotanski led the team in hitting la s t year, Collins said he thinks first-baseman Angel Santiago and third-baseman Jeff Silvey are
the team’s best h itters and he expects big things from them th is year. Last season, Santiago hit
.
.375 with six home runs and Silvey finished a t .390.

Tennis team looking to
make racket in GLVC
by Todd Spann
assistant sports editor

With two players returning from last years nationally ranked team, the SIUE
men’s tennis team is looking to rebuild back into the national elite once again.
“We are in a rebuilding phase a fte r the loss of several players from last year’s
team, but I expect to still do well in the conference. In the regional matches we still
have the same tough games against top teams in the country. They will be tough,
but I still expect to play them well,” head coach Dill Logan said in is office Monday
afternoon. “We kept the difficult matches because I intend to play them next year
and if you want to do th a t you have to keep playing them no m atterw hat. Plus it
gives the young kids the experience.”
One of the returning players is senior Ethan Halberg from Chatham, III., who
finished the fall season off with a semifinal showing a t the National Rolex
Tournament. That helped Halberg establish himself as one of the great players in
the nation.
Halberg comes into the season with a ranking of 4 5th in the nation and holds
the only ranking on th is year’s team.
“ He has improved his net game and ground strokes and has become a much
more solid player this year. He hopes to continue to improve and move up in the
rankings,” Logan said about Halberg.
Junior Jason Geminn from Fairview Hts. III., will be the other hold over from last
year’s squad and Logan is overjoyed to have him back in the line-up.
“ He went to Baylor University for a short period and decided he
wanted to come back home and play for us again and we are glad to
have him back. He is a solid player and has the ability to play well
under pressure and in difficult conditions,” Logan said. “When I need

him, I can count on him.”

Track program headed in right direction
by Todd Spann
assistant sports editor

Imagine going to the extraordinary new track facility used during
the St. Louis Olympic Festival and seeing the SIUE track team doing
field events like the discus, shot put and hurdles.
Eventually, over several years, the money the university decided to
put into the track program will help bring in these kind of events.
But for th is year they will stick to running and a little bit of
jumping.
“The direction th a t we are heading is a good direction,” head coach
Darryl Frerker said la st Thursday about the future of the track
program. “We have not had the money before to bring in other events.
This year we will have sprinters and jumpers. We will be doing long
jumps, triple jumps and maybe have a pole vaulter ... Little by little we
will be building on the track and field program and looking to increase
the programs interest.”
Not having a full fledged track team probably will hurt the team in
conference play when the schools are competing against each other.
They will not have as many points because they don’t have as many
opportunities as the other schools with full programs.
This is one reaeon why the Cougars focus a lot of attention on
individual performances rather on team performance. Qualifying for
nationals is the ultimate goal for an individual and along the way
Frerker makes them strive fo r persona\ and school records.
The women have already had several good individual performances
running in indoor tournaments during the past month.
Sophomore Colleen Casey broke the school record last weekend a t
SlU-Carbondale and also broke personai records over the past month.
And on a team of fairly young runners Frerker said she will provide a
lot of leadership during the outdoor season.
“Colleen provides a lot of leadership with her dedication and her
performance on the track. Plus setting a school record puts you in a
position of people looking up to you,” Frerker said.
The Cougars will also be relying on lone senior Stephanie Mielkl and
junior Vicki Johnson to help lead a team filled with freshmen.
“We do have a young team but with myself and a ssistant coach
Jody (LaFollet) still running regularly, we can provide some of the
leadership needed,” Frerker said. “Jody right now is trying to get ready
for the Boston Marathon. So, since we are still running we can provide
some of it.”
The one thing th a t is different about the men’s team is th a t they
have more experience than the women.
“Overall we have strong upper-class with three seniors who are
Danville Junior College transfers in Travis (Poundcount), Gus
(Coronado), and Chris (Wolf). With th a t kind of upper-class we are very
competitive and we have been throughout the indoor season.
“With Travis, Gus and Chris running well in the indoor, they have a
good chance a t qualifying fo r nationals,” Frerker said.

The Cougars also have senior’s Wayne Bloemer and Jason Gass.
Plus some added depth with junior George Patrylak.
The Cougars will begin the outdoor season a t the end of March in
the Washington Invitational in St. Louis. Before th a t, they finish out
their indoor season with the Indiana Invitational and then the NCAA-II
indoor Championships.
Over the past weekend a t the Knox Invitational, Poundcount led
SIUE with a record-breaking performance in the 1,500 meter run. His
time of 3 minutes 59.1 seconds not only earned him firs t place but
also broke the school record, which stood a t 4 minutes and 1.5
seconds.
“The indoor season builds on itself. We try to achieve the same
things in the indoor as we do in the outdoor season. It is used to get
in great shape and prepare for the outdoor,” Frerker said.
Plus the indoor season will allow a runner another opportunity to
make nationals. If they run cross-country and track, th is gives the
runner three chances a t it during a full year.
Overall the track team will try to continue it’s success from the
indoor season and hopefully bring it outside.
“We ju s t tr y to do the best of our ability and everybody is giving 100
percent and improving everyday,” Coronado said a t the track stadium
Wednesday afternoon about the up coming track season.

The other top h itte r returning fo r the Cougars is Mark
Briggs, who will join Spotanski and Mark Burris in the outfield.
Joining Santiago and Silvey on the infield will be Brian
Geluck a t second and Ryan Crawford handling the shortstop
responsibilities.
Collins said the Cougars are a little weak a t shortstop
because they lost one player from la st year, and th is year’s
back-up, Jaymie Munson is out five weeks with an injury. The
losses leave Crawford all by himself as the season begins.
Manning the designated h itte r spot for the Cougars will be
Ridenour and Clark when they are not pitching, and Collins
said Mark Steinmann will also see some time as the DH.
Collins likes what he sees in his team th is year and has
high hopes for their fir s t season in the GLVC.
“ I can’t imagine ever being out of the top five,” Collins said.
The Cougars conference schedule includes four games (two
doubleheaders) against each of the four conference schools located
nearest 5IUE and a doubleheader against the six others.
The Cougars will begin their season March 1 when they travel to

Valdosta, Oa., and then on to Ft. Myers, Fla. on March 4. While down
south, the Cougars will play a to ta l of 12 games, including a battle
with Florida Southern, the number one ranked Division. II team in the
country. The Cougars will also face Valdosta S ta te and Mansfield,
ranked number three and number seven respectively.

players who can instill th a t type of experience on
a team in the rebuilding stage,” Logan said.
Freshman B re tt Licata from St. Charles, Mo.,
will fall into the mix this upcoming season and he
believes he has already Iearned a lot from the
veteran players.
“From practicing over the fall with the team
I’ve already gotten a ta s te of college calibre play
and, throughout the course of the season, I hope
to continue improving my game,” Licata said.
Calen Hanks is another freshman making his
way onto the college scene with his lefty style of
play, which may prove to be an advantage over
the season.
“Calen has excellent ground strokes and since
he is left handed, th a t is a definite advantage for
him” Logan said.
The elder of the Hanks, M att, is a senior from
Fairview Hts., and is making his second

the Cougars in place of an injured player and now
he is back to contribute again.
“ He is a hard worker and has a great deal of
enthusiasm for the game,” Logan said.
The Cougars will s ta r t the season off in
Topeka, Kan. against some of the regions top
teams. First off is Washburn College, which is

ranked # 6 in the region. Then they play
Northwest Missouri State, who is #7 and top off
the weekend against # 3 West Texas A&M .
“ Playing top ranked teams help players gain
experience and it also gives some of our players
the opportunity to defeat players who have a
national ranking,” Logan said about the tough
schedule.
The women's tennis team will also be on the
courts trying to take care of business during the
spring portion of their season and continue their
dominance.
They rolled over teams in the fall portion of
their schedule and finished the season with a
mark of 11-0.
