Three students aw arded Kimmel Scholarship
■ BY ZHANDA JOHNSON
NEWS EDITOR
Three SIUE students are the
recipients of this y ear's Kimmel
Scholarship. The scholarship is co­
sponsored by SIUE and the Belleville
News-Democrat.
The winners are Briana Beyers, of
Pana, 111., and a sophomore majoring in
biological sciences and pre-dentistry;
Jason Hultbert, of Mt. Vernon, 111., and a
senior majoring political science; Kyle
Thompson, of Springfield, 111., and a
senior majoring in speech communication.
All three of this year’s recipients will
be presented the scholarships and plaques
of recognition at the 10th annual
Kimmel Leadership Awards Banquet, on
Thursday, March 26 at 7 p.m. in the
Meridian Ballroom.
The Kimmel Scholarship is an annual
scholarship which was established in 1990

Briana Beyers

Jason Hulbert

to recognize students for their outstanding
leadership and community volunteer
service contributions, in addition to
academic excellence. The scholarship was
named for Carol Kimmel, a form er
member of the SIU board of trustees who
continues to give freely of her time and
talent to volunteerism. The scholarship
equals tuition for two semesters at SIUE

based on the Illinois in-state rate. The
criteria on which scholarship recipients
are chosen include several elements. The
student must currently be enrolled at SIUE
with sophomore, junior, senior or graduate
class standing; have a cumulative gradepoint average of at least 3.0; demonstrate
volunteer contributions within the last two
years in leadership, service or citizenship,

Special Services help students get
through college with peer assistance

EDITOR IN CHIEF
“It’s like a small community
over here,” Wesley Thomas, 21, of
St. Louis said. “I get a sense
of home."
As part of the Special Services
mentoring program, Thomas and
Michael Vincent help freshmen
students with the difficulties of

college life.
“I just want to help people,”
Vincent said. “That’s my nature.”
Earline Patterson, program
director for Special Services in the
office of Academic Counseling and
Advisement, works to help organize
the mentors and mentees and often is
there to offer advice to all of
her students.
A strong believer in the

Kyle Thompson

program, Patterson helps uphold
the program’s motto, “Reach one,
teach one.” Though the program,
they help students remain socially
and academically focused at the
same time.
“We’re trying to send a
message of balance,” Patterson said.
“Students
that
get
started
on the right foot, stay on the
right foot.”
Patterson said their goals are to
reach freshmen as soon as they
arrive then have them work with the
mentor so they can receive the
advice they otherwise might not
have listened to if it had come from
her or one of the other staff members
at Special Services.
“(Students may be) not as apt to
buy it (advice) coming from
someone seen as an authority
figure," Patterson said.
Patterson believes that by
dealing with a peer, the mentee will
pay more attention to the mentor,
and may be more apt to follow the
advice. Mentees are encouraged to
handle problems early on and
establish good habits rather than
having to undo the damage that may
have occurred due to bad habits.
“Freshman can see what being
a successful student looks like,”
Patterson said of the program.
see SERVICES, page 2

including leadership in a student
organization or at least one elected office;
and more than 30 hours of nonpaid service
to a community agency or community
organization. In addition, a nominee must
provide two letters o f docum ented
university service and leadership, as well
as two letters documenting community
service and leadership.
This year’s recipients fulfilled all of
the criteria for the scholarship in a variety
of ways.
Beyers is currently the president of
the Dean’s College Honor Society, Phi Eta
Sigma historian, Biology Club executive
officer, Alpha Phi Scholarship director,
Intramural Basketball/Volleyball manager,
Recreational Sports Advisory Committee
Public Relations chair and an SIUE
Chancellor’s Scholar.

Racism, Northern-style Letters to the editor
You too can join the legions o f modem clay bigots, ju st pretend like it isn 't there

F e a t u r i n g e d i t o r i a l s f r o m a r o u n d c a m p u s a b o u t k i n d n e s s in a n

In the South, it’s obvious.
Racism has always been a little more obvious in the South.
Most don't even bother to try and hide it. Many Southerners hang
their rebel flags proudly and even wear them on their shirts. Smaller
versions of the rebel flag are even in the flags of many Southern
Danielle states. How many countries do you know that allow a faction that
Belton attempted to rise up and overthrow them, still wave their flag? How
many British flags were left hanging after the Revolutionary War? Not many.
But it's the truth. Mississippi just banned slavery two years ago. Racism is just
more obvious in the South.
In St. Louis, where I was raised, racism was a little more subtle. Though it’s
always been a dispute whether Missouri is Northern, Southern or Midwestern, it
is mostly north of the Mason/Dixon line, so I’m going to say Northern. In the
north, during my lifetime, most of the racism hasn’t been obvious. If my mother
hadn’t taught me about racism, 1 might have even denied it existed, for a while.
In elementary, I went to an all black school in a predominately black
neighborhood, the mostly white teachers at my school would tell us how we
were the worst children and that children in other school districts did not act like
us. They were good children and why couldn't we be as good as them? Now, the
rest of my school district was overwhelmingly white, therefore as a child, I
naturally assumed white children were somehow better behaved. Needless to
say, I was wrong. But that’s how it worked. They never said you black children
are bad, white children are better. It was always implied.
This implied racism left many people confused. I’ve had teachers suddenly
forget my papers throughout high school. They would conveniently loose them
over and over again. I’ve had teachers with sudden bouts of amnesia about
grades. If it weren’t for my mother's diligence, I probably wouldn’t have gotten
the grades I deserved in high school.
But I got used to subtle racism. My parents hate it, because they're from the
South, and at least if the racism was always obvious, they knew who the racists
were. My racists hid behind smiles of understanding and phrases like, “most of
my friends are black,” or my mother’s personal favorite, “I don't see color.”
Getting used to subtle racism isn't a good thing, because it gives you a chance
to deny that it really exists. “Oh, my teacher just lost my term paper, he wouldn’t
intentionally try to fail me!” But us Northerners get a wake-up call from time to
time. A friend of mine started an internship in Belleville, 111. While driving with
a white female co-worker, the co-worker matter-of-factly remarked, “Oh, he’s
driving like a nigger,” about a man tailgating her. After my friend informed the
boss of this, the co-worker was promoted. She offered no apology till my friend
brought it to the attention of the supervisor, four days later. It didn't matter that
this newly promoted woman would carry this prejudice with her in her new
position. It didn’t matter that she uses that particular word so much that she
mentioned it in casual speech to an obviously black person. And the most
disturbing thing is it didn’t really matter to her boss, because they probably saw
it her way. After all, they probably saw it as only a slip of the tongue, but if it
were as such it wouldn’t hurt as much.
My point is, racism is just as bad in the North as in the South. Some people
have told me that they don’t want to drive in Mississippi because of “that whole
‘race thing’” as if the Klan was going to be waiting at the turnpike for them, but
black people get pulled over by the police in the South, and they get pulled over
in the North. The only difference is, people up north like to act as if it isn’t there.
But it is, and there’s no denying it. Northerners can smile in your face and try
to suppress it, but it’s still there waiting for a chance to seep out in all it’s
ugly glory.

Touched By A
Stranger?
In the midst of freezing
weather, stressful midterms
and a week of one problem
after another, some strangers
showed a warm heart. I was on
the verge of a nervous
breakdown and ready to
explode ... when my book bag
did. The zipper busted and four
heavy books, an umbrella, a
box of paper clips, several
notebooks and 15 pens and
pencils tumbled down the
stairs of the Science Building
and scattered down the hall.
Red-faced and nervous, I
gathered the items closest to
me as a swarm of people
rushed down the stairs. Giggles
and
snickers
echoed
throughout the stairwell while I
fought back tears. When I
realized I was alone again, I
looked up and found my books
neatly stacked and my other
materials
piled
up
on
top of them. I was very
grateful
but those who
had helped left and I couldn’t
thank them.

This little act o f kindness
got me thinking. Maybe there
were still good, decent people
out there. Life really wasn’t
so bad. There were only a few
days left until spring break ...
I could make it so I put my
stuff into my broken book
bag and trudged through the
snow to work with a smile on
my face.
Those who stopped to
help me deserve my thanks. I
appreciate your taking the
time to help me, but most of
all, thank you for giving
me a reason to smile. You
brightened my dark day and
I’m sorry I didn’t get to thank
you in person.

Army orders probe in to M ckinney, Aberdeen in vestig atio n s
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Army is looking into accusations
that its own investigators coerced
witnesses in the Aberdeen sex
scandal and targeted black drill
sergeants for prosecution because
of their skin color, according a
published report Saturday.
Acting Army Secretary Robert
M. W alker this w eek asked
Inspector General Lt. Gen. Larry
R. Jordan to also probe whether
Army
investigators
acted
improperly while looking into the
sexual misconduct case of former
Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, The
(Baltimore) Sun said.
McKinney has said charges
were brought against him
because he is black. Though
acquitted of sexual misconduct,
he was found guilty last week of
one count of obstruction of

FO R

th e

justice and demoted one rank.
A w idespread sex scandal
unfolded in 1996 at Aberdeen
Proving Ground, about 40 miles
north of Baltimore, in which drill
sergeants were investigated on
charges of forcing female
subordinates to have sex.
NAACP President Kweisi
Mfume, one of those who raised
such concerns, said Friday he
was glad the Army was looking
into the charges. But he said the
Army may not be the best party
to conduct such an investigation.
“I still believe it has to be an
outside investigation if we are to
get to the truth,” said Mfume,
suggesting a panel comprising
both Army officials and civilians.
W alker directed Jordan to
report as soon as possible, the
paper said.

E D U C A T I O N

The
A rm y’s
Criminal
Investigation Command has long
defended
its
procedures,
vehemently denied racial bias or
coercion and has defended its
investigation
as
fair
and
thorough.
The com m and conducted
1,800 interviews with Aberdeen
trainees who attended the U.S.
Ordnance Center and School
since January 1995, along with
another
6,000
interviews
worldwide.
Spokesman Paul Boyce said
the
investigation
command
“welcomes the inspector general
review of its procedures and is
cooperating fully with the
independent investigation to
ensure that any remaining
allegations
are
examined

The Congressional Black
Caucus
and
the
National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People pressed for an
investigation soon after the
Aberdeen scandal broke in the
fall of 1996.
All 12 instructors charged
with sexual offenses at Aberdeen
were black, and most of the
female victims were white. Five
alleged victims at Aberdeen have
charged that Army agents tried to
coerce them into filing rape
charges against instructors.
The Aberdeen cases ended last
fall. One instructor was cleared,
and the remaining 11 were either
convicted or resigned rather than
face courts-martial.
Mfume
said
“some

C O M M U N

inappropriateness
occurred”
during
the
Aberdeen
investigation.
“Bigotry may have played a
role in who to investigate and
also who not to investigate,” he
said.
Neither the NAACP nor the
Congressional Black Caucus
came up with evidence that Army
agents were ignoring allegations
against enlisted men or officers
of other races.
Last March, Army Secretary
Togo D. West Jr. pledged to look
into the allegations, but only after
the investigations into alleged
sexual wrongdoing concluded.
West has said the Army can
handle the investigation itself,
and no independent inquiry is
needed.

Illinois nominees look to heal wounds, build coalitions
CHICAGO (AP) — Peter
Fitzgerald, in his first day as
Illinois’ Republican
senate
nominee, wasted no time
Wednesday attacking Democratic
incumbent Carol Moseley-Braun
for secretly visiting Nigeria in
1996.
Moseley-Braun, the first black
woman elected to the Senate and
viewed as the most vulnerable
Democrat seeking re-election,
struck
back
by
branding
Fitzgerald a pro-gun, anti­
abortion extremist.
The fast start to the November

campaign follow ed Tuesday’s
primary, in which Fitzgerald, a
conservative m illionaire who
spent $7 million on television
ads, swept past moderate state
Comptroller Loleta Didrickson.
In the primaries for governor,
Rep. Glenn Poshard won a sixcandidate race to take the
Democratic nom ination, while
Secretary of State George Ryan
easily won the GOP contest.
Democrats haven’t held the
governor’s office since 1976, but
Poshard began cam paigning
Wednesday by urging the party

faithful to stick together.
“There’s nothing wrong with
traditional Democratic values,
and if we stand up for them, we
can win,” he said.
Ryan tried to fit Poshard with
a traditional Democratic label —
”tax-and-spend” — but had a
more awkward situation to deal
with the m orning after the
primary.
GOP leaders, including Ryan,
had backed Didrickson in the
primary because they feared a
rerun of two years ago, when
their pro-gun,
anti-abortion
conservative
nom inee
was

crushed by a Democrat in the fall
election.
Days before the primary, Ryan
even said this about having
Fitzgerald on the ticket: "W e
should never bid the devil good
morning until we meet him .”
He was far less colorful with
Fitzgerald
by
his
side
Wednesday.
“Peter is going to be at the top
of the ticket, and w e’re proud to
have Peter there,” Ryan said.
National
Republicans,
meanwhile, have been looking to
use M oseley-Braun’s visit to
Nigerian Gen. Sani Abacha

against her at the ballot box.
The first-term Democrat made
the visit despite the regim e’s
record o f executing political
opponents and without informing
her congressional staff or the
State Department. Her chief of
staff resigned over the trip.
Moseley-Braun defended her
visit, saying she saw it as a way
to elevate concern about Africa.
That’s not the way Fitzgerald
saw it Wednesday.
“She’s been consorting with a
brutal dictator who has mowed
down a lot of his own citizens,”
he said.

Despite GOP majority, democrats would be decisve in impeachment
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Republicans would run the show,
but Democrats would be decisive
in writing the last act should it
come
to
im peachm ent
proceedings against President
Clinton.
A majority isn’t enough to
undo a president.
Two-thirds of the Senate
would have to vote to convict on
impeachm ent, which takes a
majority in the House. It could be
done on party lines in the House,
which w ouldn’t be politically
smart. And it would take
Democratic votes in the Senate to
force the final step.
Beyond that, though, as a
practical, political matter, it
would take a consensus against
Clinton, in and beyond Congress.
At this point, there’s no such
mood.
And to proceed without one
would put the Republicans into
uncertain and possibly risky
territory during the campaign for
the
off-year
congressional
elections.
Clinton
is still
scoring
approval ratings in the two-thirds
range, although those polls come
with majorities also saying they
would turn against him were it
proven that he lied and tried to
obstruct justice.
Polls can plunge, as Richard
Nixon’s did in W atergate. By
early 1973, he had dropped from
the kind of num bers Clinton

enjoys now to under 30 percent.
The Nixon case is the only
modem precedent. And his fate
—
resignation
to
avoid
impeachment and conviction —
hinged on fellow Republicans,
who told him he had to go after
disclosure of his own taperecorded words o f Watergate
cover-up days after the 1972
break-in.
Until then, he hung on,
musing
about
avoiding
conviction and ouster by the
Senate even after he knew a
House majority would vote to
impeach him. But his time was
up in 1974 when the Republicans
said so, and the minority vote
he’d thought might save him in
the Senate shrank to a handful of
last-line allies.
That was in a Democratic
Congress. The House Judiciary
Committee voted three articles of
impeachment against Nixon, who
got only 10 Republican votes and

lost them all after the evidence
essentially proved the cover-up
article.
But
R epublicans
began
turning against Nixon long
before that point in the Watergate
case. By the spring of 1974, two
Republican senators had said he
should resign, a third had forecast
that he w ould, another had
suggested that he stand aside
temporarily.
C ongressional
Democrats
aren’t rallying to defend Clinton
in the case of the women and
Whitewater, but none has turned
openly against him. Instead, they
say they’ll accept C linton’s
denials of the sex and cover-up
accusations special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr is pursuing, unless
there is proof against him.
Watergate
unfolded
in
different circumstances, without
the independent counsel law that
is Starr’s franchise for handling
impeachm ent evidence. The

special prosecutor on N ixon’s
case told the House committee
early in 1974 that he would not
share his W atergate evidence
because it was under grand jury
secrecy. That’s so in the Starr
investigation, too, but the law
now instructs him to deliver to
the House any evidence of
impeachable offenses by the
president.
House Republicans are trying
to decide how to handle that
prospect, awkwardly so far. The
Judiciary Committee is seeking
$1,45 million that could be used
for an impeachment inquiry. It
isn’t earmarked, but it could draw
Democratic opposition. The
Republicans have been having
their own debate on how to
proceed, since House Speaker
Newt Gingrich floated the idea of
setting up a special committee to
handle impeachment instead of
assigning it to the Judiciary
Committee, the traditional route.

That rankled the chairman,
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, who
com plained that it would be
divisive
and
would
risk
politicizing the process. Another
Republican committee member,
Rep. Charles Canady o f Florida,
was more vehement, protesting
publicly that it would be open to
attack as a partisan "attem pt to

An alternative may be to have
a small bipartisan group go first,

depends on Starr’s findings and

Man convicted in robbery and killing of college adm inistrator
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — A Jefferson County
jury needed three hours to convict a Trussville man of
capital murder in the robbery-slaying of a BirminghamSouthern College administrator.
But the jury needed only 20 minutes on Friday to
recommend sentencing Jason Michael Vann, 22, to life in
prison for the August 1996 murder of Robert Dortch.
Deputy District Attorney Don Cochran said eight of
the 10 jurors voted for life without parole for Vann, who
was described in court as a street hustler who had sex
with older men for money.
During the sentencing phase of the trial, defense
attorney John Robbins told jurors that Vann wanted him
to ask for the death penalty because as a homosexual, he

would rather be on death row than in the general
population. But Robbins said he could not uphold Vann’s
request and asked the jury for life in prison.
Jefferson County Circuit Judge James Hard can either
follow the ju ry ’s recommendation or sentence Vann to
death.
Vann, who was acquitted in 1995 of killing his gay
lover, is already serving a 20-year sentence for the 1993
armed robbery of a Huffman store. He was convicted of
that robbery two months after Dortch was killed.
Vann was arrested in Maryland while driving Dortch’s
1995 Honda Accord, a day after the 63-year-old college
admissions director was found dead on Aug. 27, 1996.
Police later found various articles of clothing in the car

that were instrumental in his conviction.
An Alabama forensic biologist testified that DNA
from blood stains on those jeans and shoes matched the
victim’s DNA.
Dortch’s body was found on the bathroom floor of his
Mountain Brook home. Neckties were knotted at his
ankles and wrists. He was shot in the head and stabbed
three times in the chest and eight times in the back.
A blood-soaked bathroom curtain also had Dortch’s
saliva on it, apparently stuffed into his mouth to keep
him quiet, Cochran said.
Dortch was brutally slaughtered on the floor of his
own bathroom, he said. “If that’s not a particularly
heinous murder, I don’t know what is.”

Cause of chopper safety hazzard eludes army, flights continue
BOSTON (AP) — Several
months after placing restrictions
on military UH-1 helicopters, the
military says it is unable to find
the source of a potentially
catastrophic mechanical problem,
according to a published report.
Nonetheless, the Arm y and
National Guard have decided to
continue
to
operate
the
helicopters, despite predictions
that gearbox failures are likely to
occur more than once a month.
“It amazes us that they are
continuing to let us fly,” a
M assachusetts N ational Guard
pilot told The Boston Globe on

condition of anonymity. “I have
never seen a situation where they
are predicting engine failures and
they continue to operate the
aircraft.”
The choppers have a history of
gearbox problems, which were
blamed for some near disasters
last year. Pilots reported the
engines would speed up while the
gauges dropped to zero.
According to a Feb. 24 memo
obtained by the newspaper, there
were 22 “mishaps” related to the
so-called N2 gearbox between
August 1996 and January 1998.
None has resulted in a fatality.

“Since Novem ber, several
additional N2 failures■s have
occurred,” the memo states. “At
current (operational) tempo an
average of 1:25 to 1.5 mishaps
per month can be expected to
occur.”
So far, neither the Army nor
the National Guard has come up
with a solution for the gearboxes.
The memo says it may be up to a
year before any repairs are begun
and three years before all Hueys
are fixed.
The Army and the National
Guard in N ovem ber ordered
nationwide restrictions on the

aircraft, including bans on night
flying, flying over mountains and
water, and operations such as
firefighting, except for lifesaving
operations.
M assachusetts w ent a step
further
by
restricting
the
choppers’ flight patterns and
barring them from within 35
miles of Boston.
Bob Hunt, spokesman for the
Army
Aviation
M issile
Command at Redstone, Alabama,
said a safety team reviewed
options that include banning the
helicopters.
“The Army has looked at the

situation and believes the flight
restrictions currently in use will
be adequate to ensure the safety
of the operators,” he said.
“Should anything change they
will change the status of those
flight restrictions.”
Alan E. Diehl, the Air Force’s
former top civilian safety official,
said he thinks it’s only a matter of
time before a potentially fatal
accident happens.
“It appears that the Army is
pursuing this aggressively, but it
is not enough and certainly not up
to the standards that commercial
aviation requires.”

Marines give purple heart to death row inmate
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Manuel Babbitt stood proudly as
a M arine officer pinned the
Purple Heart on his denim shirt in
front of his teary-eyed mother
and brother.
The officer shook Babbitt’s,
hands, which were shackled to
his waist throughout Friday’s
ceremony. Then the medal was
removed.
Thirty years ago, rocket fire
injured Babbitt’s head and hand
during the bloody siege of Khe
Sanh, Vietnam.
That earned him the Purple
Heart.
Eighteen years ago, Babbitt
administered a fatal beating to a
78-year-old woman.
That earned him a spot on
death row.
“The irony is, I guess, that 30
years ago he was facing a

different kind of death than he’s
facing now,” said Charles
Patterson, Babbitt’s attorney. "It
takes nothing away from the
Purple Heart. He earned it, he
deserved and I thank God that he
got it.”
Babbitt’s foxhole buddies
gathered at a news conference in
San Francisco to remember the
Marine who fought and bled on
the fields of Khe Sanh, not the
convicted killer.
“He was a model soldier. A
model M arine,” said John
Hargesheimer,
who
fought
alongside Babbitt. “You wanted
him to serve beside you. He
deserves the Purple Heart.”
For 77 days, from January to
April
1968,
the
M arines
withstood a siege by communist
forces at Khe Sanh, during the
Tet offensive, which is widely

considered one of the turning
points of the Vietnam War.
Gary Dahlheimer fought with
Babbitt as part of an anti-tank
battalion in the 3rd Marine
Division.
“We were under constant
bombardment by artillery rockets
and mortar fire ... machine-gun
fire. We were surrounded by
40,000
North
Vietnamese,”
Dahlheimer said, choking back
tears.
“It was a tragic time. A hard
time for all of us. ... We have a
tight, common bond and a love
for one another that will never
die. Today, I’d give my life for
this man as I would at that time,”
said Dahlheimer, while looking at
a photograph of Babbitt in
fatigues.
Maj. Mark Aeppli presented
Babbitt with the medal at a small

ceremony at San Quentin prison,
which reporters were not allowed
to attend.
“I ’m sym pathetic to the
families of his victims,” Aeppli
said. “But it’s important to realize
that these are two separate and
distinct incidents. And 30 years
ago he earned that medal.
Obviously one o f the most
important things you can give is
your blood.”
Aeppli said he pinned the
medal on Babbitt’s prison-issued
blue denim shirt while Babbitt’s
hands were shackled to his waist.
It was with those same hands
that Babbitt delivered a severe
beating to Leah Schendel, who
lived in a senior citizen’s
complex in Sacramento. Babbitt
also was convicted of the robbery
and attempted rape of another
woman the following night.

In his defense, Babbitt
claim ed insanity due to head
injuries suffered as a child and
again in Vietnam. His case is in a
federal appeals court.
In a terse statement issued
Friday, Attorney General Dan
Lungren said “Babbitt earned his
position on death row for his
cowardly actions long after his
military service had ended.”
Lungren asked that the public
“not forget (Babbitt) sits on death
row for the scars he has left on
the family and friends of Leah
Schendel when he callously took
her life.”
Babbitt was not allowed to
keep his Purple Heart or the
citation that came with it. They
were given to his mother
immediately after the ceremony.

Bill would provide more protections for youngsters arrested
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — The
idea of a youngster being
detained alone with a police
officer who wants a confession
isn’t good state policy as far as
Rep. Tom Klein is concerned.
“People are concerned the
police have gone too far and
parents want to know when their
child is in custody,” said Klein,
D-Wichita. “You put a 13-yearold in a room without a parent
and an adult can get him to say
anything.”
The Kansas Supreme Court
recently mandated that children
under 14 must be allow ed to
consult parents, a guardian or
attorney before w aiving their
rights, known as the M iranda
warning.
But Klein, an attorney, wants
to take it a step further by
requiring that children be given a
M iranda w arning w hen taken
into custody — not at the start of
questioning — as is done with
adults.
His bill also would require
officials to immediately try to
notify a parent, guardian or
attorney after a child is taken into
custody — which currently isn’t

required by law, but is done as a
matter of policy by many police
agencies.
“A child should have more
protections than an adult. We
protect children in so many ways
with expanded protections,” said
Klein, whose bill will be
reworked this week by a House
Judiciary subcom mittee before
the full committee acts on it.
House Judiciary Chairm an
Tim Carmody, R-Overland Park,
also wants the subcommittee to
address other concerns, such as
who must be notified before
children could be questioned.
Critics say such notification
could impede an investigation if a
parent or guardian couldn’t be
quickly located and an attorney
had to be summoned.
Klein said that could be dealt
with by allowing an interested
party _ a clergyman, teacher or
family friend — to be contacted
if a parent or guardian can’t be
found, or if the parent is involved
in the crime.
Police
officials
and
prosecutors have lined up to
condem n
the bill
as
an
impediment to law enforcement

that would allow young criminals
to go free and crim es to go
unsolved.
Besides, they argued, there are
enough safeguards already in
place with the Supreme Court
ruling and juvenile laws that
protect youngsters.
“It will make their job more
difficult and they d o n 't like
things that make their job
harder,” Klein said. "But the sky
isn’t falling like they say.”
Both chambers this week will
be busy with a pile of bills poised
for debate. At the top of the heap
is the second part of the House’s
higher education restructuring
plan.
Last week the chamber passed
and sent to the Senate a proposed
constitutional am endm ent to
replace the Board of Regents
with a Council on Higher
Education.
The focus this week will be on
a com panion bill that would
implement plans to create an 11member council to govern the
state’s six universities and
Washburn University and would
coordinate program s of 19
community colleges and 11

Leaders of both chambers say
that if the enabling legislation
falters in the House, the proposed
amendment will be shelved in the
Senate — and the first major
change for higher education in
three decades will die, at least for
this session.
The House Appropriations
Committee has endorsed plans to
add $93.8 million for universities
over the next four years.
Also on the front burner this
week is the prom ise that the
House and Senate will reach
agreement on a final version of
tax relief legislation. Negotiators

The House wants to include an

Senate, which wants to repeal the

$35.9 million increase proposed
by Gov. Bill Graves. The public
education aid amounts to more
than $2 billion in the proposed
state budget.

■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
cstulce@siue.edu
Once anything becomes
extremely popular, people
automatically want to scrutinize
it. Take for example, the
mammoth trash talk show, Jerry
Springer. Sure, it’s pure candy
for the eyes and ears, and it has
no redeemable value. But,
because it’s a ratings smash,
people can’t quit talking about it.
Two weeks ago, I was asked
to be a guest on an MSNBC talk
show because of an article I
wrote about the Jerry Springer
show. There were to be four
guests on this debate/talk show;
two who liked Jerry, two who
didn’t. I told the producer that I
enjoyed watching Jerry’s show
after a long day, that it helped
me relax. I get a kick out of
watching trashy people fight and
curse at each other. It makes me
feel a little better about my sad
little life. Hey, at least no one is
throwing a shoe at my skull on
national television trying to
kill me.
Unfortunately, the second
guest who was pro-Jerry was a
dim-bulb housewife from
Podunk, USA. She takes the
show VERY seriously and even
has her family tape it when she
is away. Plus, she seemed to
have trouble forming a complete
thought. This was my comrade
in arms and we were facing off
against the television critic from
the Chicago Tribune and a
psychologist. Suffice to say, I
tried to do my best to avoid our
side from turning into a James
Cameron epic. She offered no
help, so I did my best to keep
her from not getting a word in.
Unfortunately, the host kept
picking at her.

Denise Richards is about to
enter uncharted waters. She
plunged onto the silver screen in
the bug-attack sci-fi flick
“Starship Troopers” and now
costars with six degrees of A-list
actors Kevin Bacon, Neve
Campbell, Matt Dillon, Bill
Murray and Robert Wagner in
the sexy noir pic, “Wild Things.”
I know you’ve guest-starred
in “Doogie Hauser, M.D.,”
“Melrose Place” and “Against
the Grain,” in addition to
your
movie
roles
in
“Nowhere,” and “Starship
Troopers.” Have you always
wanted to be an actress?
Yes, ever since I was little.
When I was in high school, I
took drama, but I w asn’t
pursuing it as a career then. I
started out m odeling in high
school, but I wanted to quit that
type of work really young so that
I could start taking acting
classes. After I graduated from
high school, I moved up to L.A.
and then got a theatrical agent,
began studying with a coach, and
started doing TV shows, to build
my resume, and guest spots. I did
some pilots and movies of the
week. And then I just kept
building my resume. Then I got
“Starship Troopers,” and then
“Wild Things.”
W hat do you find most
rewarding about acting?

P

I like doing the work, but I’m
not comfortable seeing my work.
I would be more comfortable just
doing it and then moving on to
the next project. I saw “Wild
Things” two or three weeks ago,
and it was so hard to watch
myself on the screen, really hard.
Really?
H arder
than
watching some of the other
work you’ve done?
It’s very difficult to watch
anything I do. It’s hard to be so
objective because I’m so critical.
I’d like to get to the point where
I can watch my performance,
and then ju st critique it
objectively. I love doing the
work, though.
That must be tough, but I’m
sure it will get easier the more
work you do.
I don’t know. I’ve talked to
other actresses who are older,
and have been working for a
long time and they say the same
thing. I don’t know if you ever
get over that.
How is it interacting with
other people on the set? It
probably differs from film
to film...
Yeah, on “Starship Troopers,”
we were all the same age, we
were all at the same level in our
career, which was really great.
We were all very excited.
“Starship” really helped me. So
many times, directors don’t want

a g e

9*

to hire a new face. The studio
doesn’t want to take the chance.
That’s why I’m so grateful to
Paul Verhoeven, because he
really took a chance on me. On
all of us, because we were all
new faces. Because of that, it
helped me get “Wild Things.”
“Wild Things” was good because
I got to learn from actors who
who’ve been working for a long
time. All of them were very
generous,
Kevin
Bacon
especially. He was the most
professional person I’ve ever
worked with. He is incredible,
and I would love to work with
him again. Neve was great to
work with too. It was a great
experience. I learned a lot on
“Wild Things.”
Could you tell us, in a few
sentences, what “Wild Things”
is about?
It’s basically a film noir, a
thriller. The film is about
revenge, and lust and greed. It
starts out where Neve and I set
up Matt Dillon’s character for
rape, but that’s not really what
the film is about. That’s just the
beginning. Everything happens
after that. It has a lot of twists
and turns in it. I t’s like a
“Scream” meets “Body Heat.”
Can you tell me a little
about your character Kelly?

“Primary Colors” provides a fast, fun look at the
dirty dealings on the road to th e W hite House
■ BY HILLEL ITALIE
AP WRITER
How strange to watch “Primary
C olors,” an adaptation of a
fictionalization o f a presidential
candidacy that at times played like a
romance novel. The film is the image
of an image o f yet another image, a
racy folk tale that has changed with
every telling.
Forgive this critic for giving away
the plot. Pudgy, people-hugging Jack
Stanton, a Southern governor, runs
for president and promises to change
America. Allegations of womanizing
damage his campaign, but not enough
to keep Jack and his blonde, brainy
wife from dancing a victory waltz on
election night.
Director Mike Nichols has said
“Primary Colors” isn’t meant to be

about the Clintons, but by now their
story is too famous, even mythic, to
make us believe otherwise. The
“Stantons” of both the film and the
novel by “Anonym ous” (later
revealed to be journalist Joe Klein)
can only be the Clintons. How we
react is inseparable from how we feel
about them.
A C linton loyalist might be
relieved that the director wasn’t a
left-wing critic of the administration.
Forget sex. There would have been
references to w elfare cuts or
campaign financing, maybe a subplot
about Rickey Ray Rector, the brain­
damaged Arkansas prisoner executed
during the 1992 campaign. ThenGov. Clinton had refused to grant
clemency.

The world of ska music has exploded onto the m
but has it become tee bloated and mixed-up te
►rends in music come and go quicker than
—
ever. But, before long every music style
experiences a resurgence. Ska music is
currently riding its third wave of
popularity. With bands like No Doubt and
the Mighty Mighty Bosstones enjoying
Top 40 status, the Jamaican-based music is
enjoying mainstream success.
But, are those bands really ska? Will there be a skaoverload? W hy is a forty-year-old music style enjoying a
resurgence? Before these questions can be answered, a little
background material is required.
Ska m usic’s first wave was hatched in the early ’60s in
Jam aica by bands like the Skatalites and Toots and the
Maytels. Ska was bom as dance music, a hybrid of rhythm
and blues, jazz and calypso, for the working class people of
Jamaica. It found popularity in the United Kingdom and
eventually crept stateside.
Ska fans were known as “rude boys.” They were
originally thought of as hooligan boys who caused havoc in
the streets, while dressed in black suits, porkpie hats and dark
sunglasses. But, by the second wave of ska the term “rude
boy” was revived, but by then being called a “rude boy” was
the epitome of coolness. The Specials used a drawing of a
rude boy to illustrate one of their album covers.
In the late ’70s and early ’80s, the second wave emerged
with European acts like The Specials and Madness gaining
popularity. This was known as two-tone ska, which was
tighter, faster and involved more horns than the first wave.
In the last ten years, the third wave of ska has emerged.
Underground acts like the Toasters and Bim Skala Bim
started the resurgence that has since grown to unbelievable
proportions. The sound changed again. Instead of the jazz
and blues style, this ska music was more like punk rock with
horns. Bands like Reel Big Fish, Save Ferris, Goldfinger and
Less Than Jake emerged with a punk with brass sound. Ska
was not clearly defined anymore.
“Ska is an evolutionary process,” said Tom Rezabeck, an

SIUE alumnus who has been researching ska music since
1994. “It’s a hodgepodge [of sounds]. Part of that is because
of short attention spans.”
The ’90s cannot be pinned down as having one particular
sound as have decades in the past. The ’60s had British rock,
the ’70s had disco, the ’80s had new wave, and the ’90s has
had grunge, punk-revival, electrónica, gangsta rap, ska,
among others. There is a glut of styles, and styles within
those styles. People have more varied tastes, and musical
trends come and go quicker than presidential scandals. So,

why has ska returned to popularity?
“I think it’s taken all this time for people’s ears to adjust
to this sound of music,” said Alex Desert, lead singer of the
Hepcats. “Ska is more about a feeling. It’s easy to play ska,
but the good ska is that ska that hits you.”
Greg Lee, the Hepcats other lead singer, agrees. “Ska is
not easy. The way a lot of new bands play it is easy, because
they’re taking a ska-punk blend, and making it a hybrid.
We’re trying to play to the root, and this stuff is harder
because you have to play it slower, with longer,
sustained notes. I can run down a list of ska bands being
played on the radio, and none of them are doing it with that
kind of feeling.”
The Hepcats are one of the few acts that are playing a
traditional form of ska music. They are inspired by the
Skatalites and use the slower, root-based sound in their
music. Groups like the Hepcats are in the minority as far as

and have a good time. “I’d like it
to be that people go hear music because they like it and it’s
good music. But, it doesn’t seem like we’re pushing towards
that right now. Everyone still tries to classify everything,”
said Tavis Wert, trumpet player for Reel Big Fish.
Rezabeck concurs. “It’s a natural process to category
things, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing.” He said because
of the large number of ska or ska-influenced bands, it’s easier
for critics and fans to label any band with a horn section or a
certain sound as a ska band.
Unfortunately, an answer to the question of what the
future for ska will be has to go unanswered. There are
probably many less real ska bands than people think. Skainfluenced acts like No Doubt and the Aquabats will continue
to stay popular because they are easily digestible, but they
may not be longstanding.
Whereas acts like Bim Skala Bim and the Hepcats, who
combined have performed ska over 25 years, may keep their
low-profile status for years to come. Nevertheless, after this
wave of ska popularity has come and gone, a fourth wave is
imminent. Maybe country ska is not that far-fetched.

She’s very wealthy, and Theresa Russell plays
my mom. On the outside, she’s very much puttogether, but she’s also manipulative, and has every
dark side to her. She has a different kind of strength.
In “Starship Troopers,” my character was a fighter
pilot, very strong, and ambitious and driven but
this character, Kelly ... she’ll do anything! And I
think it takes a different type of strength to do that
... but on the other hand, it’s a sign of weakness. But
I had a lot of fun playing her — it was fun to play
an evil woman. You know, everyone has a little evil
in themselves.
Are there any similarities between you and
your character, Kelly?
Well, I’ll tell you. I wouldn’t trust anyone in
“Wild Things.” If I knew all these people in real
life, there’s no way I’d be friends with any of them.
What was the hardest part for you about
playing Kelly?
Our characters are all basically lying, and that
was hard. We spent two weeks of rehearsal in
Miami before we started shooting, and we all sat
around, Kevin, Matt, Neve and I, going over the
script to figure out who knows what at what point,
so that we w eren’t confused. It was like lying on top
o f lying. The whole role itself was a challenge. I’ve
never played a character like this. I’m totally
opposite from her.
In “Wild Things,” you obviously have more
than a schoolgirl crush on Matt Dillon, who
plays your guidance counselor. Did you ever have
a crush on any of your high school teachers?
Oh yeah, Mr. Griffin. He taught science and
looked like Christopher Reeve.
Denise, do you know w hat’s coming up for
you next?
Well, right now I’m trying to find a romantic
comedy, or a really nice period piece. I’m just
looking at scripts, and there are a couple of things

Denise Richards stars with Neve Campbell

w e’re trying to figure out. I haven’t committed
to anything at this point. I would love to work
with some of the female actresses. I would love to
w ork with Susan Sarandon, Jessica Lange or
M ichelle Pfeiffer. They’ve all got really great
careers. They all seem like very classy women,
have made great choices and they’re amazing
actresses. I’ve seen interviews with them, and they
seem very professional.
Did you have someone in Hollywood, that you
knew, that sort of took you under their wing?
No, I moved here by myself. It was hard, but it
was something I really wanted to do. I got an agent,
and just started the building process.
One last question. You obviously keep in good
shape. What is your secret?
Pilates! It’s the best. I’ve tried every form of
exercise, but Pilates really elongates your muscles.
O f course, every girl says they don’t want to build
their legs, and this doesn’t build at all. It really
lengthens the muscles. I do Pilates a lot. Before that,
I was doing kickboxing, which is good, and
spinning. I do Pilates four times a week and when I
was doing kickboxing, I was going five to six times
a week. But, I definitely do have to work out. I’m
not one of those girls who can eat whatever I want
and still weigh 100 pounds.

But a Clinton supporter might
be disappointed in Nichols,
supposedly a friend of the
president.
Not
artistically
disappointed; the film is quite
well done. But politically
disappointed,
for
“Primary
Colors” is surprisingly hard on
Clinton as a man and ambivalent
about his success.
The central character of
“Primary Colors” is actually not
Jack Stanton, but young Henry
Burton (Adrian Lester), a
congressional aide and grandson
of a great civil rights leader. Tired
of backing losing candidates,
Henry risks his liberal ideals and
lets him self be lured by the
Stantons (John Travolta and
Emma Thompson) into helping
manage their campaign.
The Stantons and their
followers are an attractive bunch:
smart, sassy, resourceful. They
have answers for everything,
and they will have plenty to
answer for.
The events Henry witnesses
are slight variations on what is
now
popular
history:
the
Gennifer Flowers scandal and the
Clintons’joint appearance on “60
Minutes”; reports about Clinton’s
opposition to the Vietnam War;
the antics of such campaign
insiders as strategist James
Carville
and troubleshooter
Betsey Wright.
This film is somewhat softer
than the novel, if not the actual
campaign, but it’s disturbing in a
way only those close to Clinton
could get across. H enry will
come to w onder just what
happens when you get involved
with people who seem to know
more about you than you do
about them.

I managed to get the last word in,

The main argum ent of the
anti-Jerry movement was that his
show was exploiting these poor
people he had on as guests. They
said the show encouraged them to
fight and argue. Sure, Jerry may
stir the pot like a good puppeteer
from time to tim e, but these
people
don’t
need
much

“Primary Colors” is Nichols’
second feature with screenwriter
and form er stand-up comedy
partner Elaine May, and is
m ainstream film m aking at its
most accom plished. N ichols’
direction is lively and confident.
M ay’s script is tight and nuanced,
its balance between satire and
drama almost up to the standards
of Preston Sturges.
The
actors,
especially
Thompson, do a great job of
suggesting their real-life models
without getting lost in them. And
there are a couple of nice bonus
performances; Larry Hagman as
a
m elancholy
presidential
candidate and Rob Reiner as the
nasal-voiced host of the radio talk
show, “Schmooze for Jews.”
Travolta’s is the riskiest
performance. He looks a lot like
Clinton, maybe too much, and he
has m astered the president’s
soulful drawl. W hen you watch
him throw temper tantrums and
whine about the media you get
the feeling this is how Clinton
himself behaves.
You could dism iss this as
simply an im personation, but
Travolta’s an actor playing a man
who is essentially an actor.
Nothing Stanton says or does
seems connected to who he is.
H e’s hollow, an em pathetic
puppet, and his smile can be as
scary as a skeleton’s.
Nichols and May might have
wanted “Prim ary C olors” to
make us m ore accepting of
political leaders, but Travolta
undermines that. How good can
you feel when the story ends with
a man such as Stanton asking you
to trust him?
“Primary Colors,” a Universal
release, was produced by Nichols
and is rated R, for profanity and
adult situations. The running time
is 140 minutes.

fifteen minutes o f fame. And hey,
they get a free trip to Chicago.
If they are foolish enough to
go on “Jerry” without watching
an episode first, they deserve
whatever they get. Who could
possibly be surprised about what
they’re going to find out during
the big “Shocking Surprise”
episodes? No one ever gets good
news on “Jerry.” There’s no fun
and no ratings in good news,
is there?
If I were ever to become a
guest on “Jerry,” which would
probably
never
happen,
(Prerequisites include: missing
teeth, a butt-cut, numerous sex
partners, no job and a fired-up
mother-in-law) I would always
be wary. I would never turn my
back on som eone, or even
pretend that anyone on that stage
was my friend. O f course, if Jerry
ever had guests who thought that
deeply about it ahead of time,
he would find his show in a
ratings free-fall.

Cougar softball betters record, tans over spring break

The Lady Cougars were
bettering their tans and their

Offensive struggles left SIUE
scoring only two runs in the two
games. Columbus State peppered
the Lady Cougars for ten hits in
each of the two games to sweep
SIUE with a 4-2 victory and a
9-0 win.
SIUE was hearing the crack of

the bat a bit more in their opening
contest of the Rebel Spring
Games. The Cougars scored six
runs on 11 hits and held a 6-1
lead after two and a half innings,
but South Dakota State scored
two runs in the bottom half of the
inning and storm ed back in
bottom of the seventh to tack on
four more runs and steal a 7-6
victory. Kari Franzen, Mandy
Uhrhan and Kim Messinger each
had two hits in a losing cause.
Shippensburg University of
Pennsylvania also proved to be
too much for SIUE as it had a
four-run fifth inning en route to a
5-1 win.
The Cougars were in need of a
confidence builder and they got it
in the game against Long IslandC.W. Post. SIUE jum ped out to a
2-0 lead in the second before
Long Island tied the game in the
top of the sixth. M orton’s Niki

Mitts took the game into her
hands in the bottom of the inning
when she blasted a solo home run
to give the Cougars the 3-2 win.
Momentum was on the side of
the Cougars as they continued to
win in another tight game.
SIUE’s nine hits were enough to
down Southam pton 3-2. Kim
W agner and Sarah Sollberger
both had two hits including a
double. Sara Obrecht pitched
all seven innings to pick up
the victory.
SIUE faced Southampton
College

University again the next day,
but the Cougars took control and
never looked back gaining a
10-0 win. Wagner had two RBI
and a home run, Uhrhan went 3
for 4 and added two RBI and
Gwen Jackson contributed three
hits. Senior pitcher Deanna
Smith allowed only one hit in

picking up the shutout.
Jessica Silbe recorded SIUE’s
fourth straight win against the

What began as a disappointing
start for the SIUE hockey team
ended with a five game winning
streak and many positives to look
forward to for next year.
The C ougars finished their
season beating the M issouriIllinois Senior All-Stars, 9-8.
Defenseman Rob Maher led
the way with four goals in the
third period. Forw ards Ben
Fullbright and Dan Kennedy
added two goals each.
“I was pleased with what I
saw,” said head coach Bill
Misiak. “It was a shame to see the
season come to an end with the
kind of streak we were on.”
Finishing with a 6-9 record,
the Cougars could not buy a win
early on. Although they won their
first game o f the season a against
Illinois S tate University 8-3,
SIUE w ent on a nine-gam e
losing streak.
“It took a while for us to gel,”
said defenseman Marc Popelar.
“As we were losing games, we
were losing players as well.”
The Cougars lost eight players
during the first half of the season
including their captain and
leading scorer, Derek Zirkelbach.
“At first it was difficult to get
the players at the level they
needed to be,” M isiak said. “But
after som e hard work and
dedication, the guys turned things
around.”
After the Christmas break, the
Cougars lost only three games.

M isiak said one of the many
reasons
for
the
team ’s
improvement was the addition
of M aher and defensem an
Dave Miskelley.
“Our defense was a big area of
concern. We were giving up too
many goals,” he said. “Those
guys came in and helped out a
great deal.”
Popelar said he believes the
turning point of the season was
against U niversity o f Illinois.
Although they lost 10-1, he said
the team came together.
“Even though the outcome
didn’t show it, Coach Misiak and
all the players felt that had been
our best played game of the
season,” Popelar said.
Their following game against
University o f Missouri-St. Louis
began a five-game winning streak
and snapped their long nine-game
losing streak.
“It was exciting as hell to
finally win a game,” Popelar said.
“After that the attitudes in the
locker room and at practice were
as high as they could be. It was
like a monkey had been lifted off
our backs. We knew we
could win.”
With this only being their
second year in the A merican
College Hockey Association and
first in the Illinois-W isconsin
college hockey division, Misiak
believes the team can only
get stronger.
“I am really looking forward
to next year,” M isiak said. “There
are a lot o f things that we can
improve to make us even better.”

only two hits in a 2-0
SIUE victory over Kentucky
Wesleyan College.
Sollberger led the Cougars to
an 11-1 win over Bellarmine
College. She went 3 for 3 with
two long balls, a double and five
RBI in the game. Messinger also
added three hits and Cindy Kolda
went 2 for 4 with three RBI.
U niversity
of
Southern
Indiana proved to be one of the
top teams in the Great Lakes
Valley Conference, but SIUE
won the defensive battle. Amy
Vandervinne knocked in the only
RBI in the sixth inning and
Jessica Silbe added a shutout to
her stats as the Cougars nabbed a
1-0 victory.
SIUE is 12-11 on the season
and continues its GLVC tour with
stops in St. Louis, to take on
University of Missouri-St. Louis
tomorrow, and Quincy Universtiy
this Thursday.

‘Kid’ M ike Caruso aims for big leagues at age 20
TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — He
wants to make the jum p from
Class A to the Chicago White Sox
and play one of the most visible
and crucial positions in the game.
At age 20.
Some days Mike Caruso looks
ready. He leads off with a bunt
single, slaps two other left-handed
hits to the outfield and then nearly
drives one out of the stadium in
his next at-bat.
Minutes later, a routine
grounder he knows he can handle
rolls up his arm as he tries to
throw before he has possession.
Another error. He’s made five
this spring.
“I’m having fun out there,
learning from the other guys and
trying to make the team,” Caruso

says.

i n t think
t h i n V iabout
l K n l i t tthat
K ot o
i l really.
r a o lll/
don’t
atf oall,
I’m out here to play baseball and
improve my game. No matter
what, I’m going to be playing
somewhere.”
One reason Jerry Manuel was
hired as manager of the White Sox
was his ability to work with young
players as he did while coaching
at Montreal.
“Patience,” he says. “If the
vote goes to keep him, you have
to have a program in place for
him to continue this development.
Some things he has to learn
by experience.”
Caruso came to the White Sox
organization last summer in a
controversial nine-player deal
with San Francisco when Chicago

traded three major-league pitchers
«v
to the Giants for nsix
prospects
The trade at the time was
viewed as a “white flag” from the
White Sox, who were only 3 1/2
games out of first place with two
months to play.
Another player the White Sox
received in the trade, Keith
Foulke, pitched well for the team
last season out of the bullpen.
Caruso, who batted .304 in two
minor league seasons with 38
stolen bases and a whopping 80
errors, was invited to spring
training as a non-roster player.
Chicago didn’t bring back
veteran Ozzie Guillen,
so

trying to accomplish. In 1993, he
broke in with the Rangers at age
20 after spending the previous
season at Class A. He was quickly
sent to the minors and ended up
playing just 22 major league
games that season.
“I know that (Caruso) is a good
prospect,” said Gil, who batted
.224 for the Rangers last season.
“But this is a new start for me, and
my approach is that I’m going to
do all I can to win the job.”
Gil wants the starter’s role but
is still free with the advice for his
young competition.
“He helps me out when we
take ground balls and stuff. I listen
to him out there because he’s got

experience," said Carus

over
300 this spring, while Gil is
under .200.
Caruso’s talent is apparent. It’s
just a matter of where the White
Sox — who say they are
emphasizing defense — want to
cultivate it.
“I want to show them that I can
play. I just need to concentrate,”
Caruso said.
“I need to work on my game. I
want to show them that I can go
out there and play every day and
get on base for the big guys. I
don’t think age is that big of a
deal. This is what I have been
working for, what I ’ve been
training for.”

CSU’s Eslinger to be team ’s starting quarterback
FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP)
— Patience has never been a
virtue
for
Ryan
Eslinger,
Colorado State University’s fifthyear senior quarterback.
He despises movie lines and
red traffic lights.
Yet, he has w aited for the
chance to start for CSU, Western
Athletic Conference and Holiday
Bowl champions.
After four years o f clipboard
holding and working with reserve
units, his wait is finally over.
On Monday, Eslinger will be
the team ’s No. 1 quarterback
when the Rams begin spring
football drills.
“I am not by nature a patient
person,” Eslinger said. “But in

this case I had no control over
my situation.”
Eslinger’s wait began when
he
and
fellow
freshman
quarterbacks Craig Aikens and
Moses M oreno arrived on
campus four years ago. Moreno
would becom e the team ’s
starting quarterback.
Their sophomore year, junior
college transfer Daren Wilkinson
was brought in to compete with
Moreno.
The
two
shared
quarterback duties the year after
E slinger’s redshirt freshman
season. Aikens departed. But
Eslinger, a Pueblo native,
remained a seldom-used reserve
the past two years.

“I contem plated going and
playing
some
baseball,
something I had a chance to do
coming out of high school, and
maybe going to New Mexico
where I could play both baseball
and football,” Eslinger said.
“I thought about trying to get
on with a minor league farm club,
but I never really dwelled on it,”
he said.
“I was skeptical of what the
future w ould h o ld .” Eslinger
said. “I had to remind myself I
had to hang in there, to stay
focused and everything would
work out.”
CSU head football coach
Sonny Lubick said of Eslinger,

Cincinnati Reds waiting for Rose fallout
DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) — The
Cincinnati Reds are waiting for
major league baseball to decide
whether they should be punished
for allowing Pete Rose to talk to
a group of minor leaguers.
Rose, who is banned from
baseball because of gambling,
visited the R eds’ minor-league
camp on March 11 to see his son,
Pete Jr., w ork out. At the
invitation of a Reds minor-league
official, he talked to a group of
farm hands - a violation of his
banishment.
The Reds could be fined for

allowing R ose to talk to the
m inor leaguers.
The
club
subm itted
a
report
after
the violation occurred, but
has received no indication
what
baseball
will
do,
managing executive John Allen
said Sunday.
“We made it very clear what
happened,”
Allen
said.
“Ultimately it’s my fault. I knew
Pete was going to be down here. I
should have pulled people aside
(to
tell
them
o f R ose’s
restrictions) and I didn’t.”
Allen attended the ow ners’

meeting in St. Petersburg last
week and talked about it briefly
with National League president
Len Coleman. Allen said there
was no indication when baseball
might have a decision.
He hopes baseball accepts the
team’s explanation that it didn’t
intentionally violate the terms of
Rose’s ban.
“As of right now, indications
are that th at’s something that
they’ll view as an honest
mistake,” Allen said.
What baseball does to Rose is
a separate matter.

“The guy
showed a lot of
courage. He hung in there tough
and accepted his role and what
was best for the team.”
Eslinger is com ing off a
season in which he saw limited
playing time. Last year, he
completed 10-of-18 passes for
144 yards and a touchdown.
He played most of the fourth
quarter of last year’s Holiday
Bowl and ran a fake field goal 23
yards for a touchdown.
Not long after bowl game he
received the news h e ’d been
waiting
for from
Lubick:
“Eslinger
is
the
No.
1
quarterback.”
“I couldn’t have been more

pum ped,” Eslinger said. “The
announcement made the waiting
worth it.”
Eslinger, a conventional dropback passer who had endured a
high school program
that
em ployed the option offense,
knows he is under the gun to
perform well. He said he knows
his collegiate career comes down
to a one-year proposition.
“People will look at my
background and say I don’t
have the experience of a threeyear starter,” Eslinger said.
“W hat I offer is a quarterback
with the experience of knowing
the system and being comfortable
with it.”

Broncos’ Braxton accused of
sexual harassment assault
DENV ER (AP) — Four
women have accused Tyrone
Braxton of the Denver Broncos
of exposing himself and sexually
assaulting them at a Denver
nightclub in January.
Lawyer Anne Sulton, legal
counsel for the NAACP in
Denver,
filed
the
sexual
harassm ent
and
assault
com plaint on the w om en’s
behalf in Denver District Court
on Friday.
The law suit contends the
33-year-old d^efensive back
was at the I-Beam nightclub
on Jan. 27 with teammates when
he approached a group of
women and began making

sexually explicit remarks and
grabbing them.
On
Saturday,
police
confirmed an indecent-exposure
com plaint was filed against
Braxton on Jan. 30, but there
was no mention of sexual assault
or harassm ent included in
the complaint.
Sulton said claims that sexual
harassm ent
and
assault
complaints were not made by her
clients were “a lie.”
She said the women called
her after police did not press
charges against Braxton. Sulton
said she decided to file suit after
discussions with the player’s
lawyers broke down.

At age 42, Dennis Martinez gets a new start in Atlanta
KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) —
Dennis Martinez had given up
hope. His right elbow, wracked
by pain, seemed incapable of
throwing another pitch. At age
42, it was time to get used to the
idea of retirement.
“I thought it was over,”
Martinez said. “I was starting to
enjoy my family and kids.”
After resting the injured elbow
for three months, M artinez
decided to play catch with his 10year-old son, Ricardo. Little
did anyone know, but that
was the beginning
of a
remarkable comeback.
“There was no pain at all,”
Martinez recalled Sunday, his
youngest son at his side in the
Atlanta
Braves
clubhouse.
“ ‘Well, hey,’ I said to myself, ‘I’ll
continue throwing and see where
this goes.’”
M artinez then got together

with his
16-year-old son,
Gilberto, throwing a little harder
and still experiencing no pain.
Finally, he moved up to his oldest
son, 24-year-old Dennis, Jr., a
minor-leaguer with the Cleveland
Indians. It was like old times.
“If I had felt any pain, I would
not have ever tried it,” said
Martinez, who hasn’t pitched in a
major-league game since he was
released by Seattle last May with
a 1-5 record and a 7.71 ERA.
“But I never felt any pain.”
He hooked on with a team in
the Puerto Rico winter league,
performing well enough to get a
call from the Braves, who were
looking for some insurance for
their glittering rotation after John
Smoltz underwent elbow surgery.
Now, “El Presidente” is
assured of opening the season as
a member of the best pitching
staff in baseball.

“He has been a surprise,”
manager Bobby Cox admitted.
“He’s pitched good enough to
make our team.”
Martinez, who is 0-1 with a
4.15 ERA in 13 pain-free innings,
will start out in the bullpen until
the Braves need a fifth starter
about 10 games into the season.
But his performance has been
so impressive that there’s no
need to rush back Smoltz, who
has pitched only one inning
this spring.
“I know Dennis has worked
really hard,”
said Andres
Galarraga, who played with
M artinez for six seasons in
Montreal and was reunited with
him in Atlanta. “Guys like him
and Nolan Ryan, they’re special.
You don’t see many pitchers stay
around that long.”
Martinez has even drawn trade
interest from Cleveland, another

of his former teams. A few
months ago, when he first
pondered the possibility o f a
comeback, the Indians wouldn’t
even return his phone calls.
“It’s kind of weird,” Martinez
said. "But I also feel good about
it. They had given up on me, but
now they’re showing some
interest. I have no hard feelings
against anybody. This is a game,
this a business. I understand the
system and I can deal with
anything. I’m just here to pitch. If
it’s somewhere else, fine. But I’d
rather be here, though.”
Martinez, the last pitcher to
throw a perfect game, seems
to have blended well with
the Braves’ rotation, which
includes form er Cy Young
winners Smoltz, Greg Maddux
and Tom Glavine along with
Denny Neagle, a 20-game winner
in 1997.

“I’m trying to help them out
every way I can, not only
physically
but
m entally,”
Martinez said. "And I’m getting a
lot of help from these guys. I
talk to them a lot, getting pointers
and feedback. There’s a lot of
good, common sense going
around with everyone here. The
chemistry is great.”
If Martinez remains healthy,
he
feels
confident
about
breaking Juan M arichal’s record
for most wins by a Latin
American pitcher. Martinez has a
career mark o f 241-187, two
victories behind Marichal.
“It means a lot to m e,”
M artinez said of the Latin
pitching record. “I’m here for
that, too. I’m not kidding myself.
It’s a way to motivate myself, a
way to achieve something that’s
good. We’ll see what happens.”

Junior college quarterback used to urge competition at Colorado
BOULDER, Colo. (AP) —
Mike M oschetti is in the
middle of the race for the job as
Colorado’s quarterback, joining
Adam
Bledsoe,
Jerem y
Weisinger and Gabe Leonard in
the fray.
But that position isn’t new to
the 23-year-old transfer from
Mount San Antonio College.

“When I came to Mount San
Antonio
there
were
five
quarterbacks and I hadn’t played
football in four years,” Moschetti
said. “I had to start from scratch
to see if I still had it.”
Moschetti
had
been
a
shortstop reaching Class A in the
Oakland A’s organization. During
his final season at Modesto of the

California League he hit .350 and
used his 4.5 speed in the 40 to be
a base-stealing threat before
turning his attention to football.
“I’ve heard some stories that
the reason I am playing football
is I struggled in the minor leagues
which is totally false,” Moschetti
said. “I was coming off my best
year and they were really excited

about me, but that is when it
dawned on me that it w asn’t
for me.”
He eventually won the
starting job at M ount San
Antonio and threw for 1,600
yards and 13 touchdowns while
running for 520 yards as a
freshman.
His
sophomore
numbers were even better, with

Utah Utes celebrate a final four appearance, finally
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) —
Finally, a Final Four team for
the University of Utah.
Thirty-two years after the Utes
last made it to NCAA tournament
semifinals, Utah has a chance to
howl. The problem was, when the
opportunity presented itself, there
were only a few people around to
do the howling.
The Utes returned home after
their 25-point blow out of
defending national cham pion
Arizona to a campus deserted
by spring break.
So the
celebration was lim ited to the
players and the few staff and

students still at the school.
“This would happen on spring
break, when th ere’s nothing
going on cam pus,” said Michelle
Graves, a secretary for the
Utes sports information office.
“There’s nothing happening; I
wish there was, but there
just isn’t.”
But Graves wouldn’t let that
dampen her spirits.
“I’m going to San Antonio,
the Final Four, baby!” she
screamed into the telephone.
A thousand people greeted the
team at the airport Saturday
night, and freshm an forward

Britton Johnsen was one of the
first to wade into the sea of
exuberant fans.
"We’re in the Final Four —
the Final F our!” he shouted,
thrusting his fist in the air.
“This is great. We have great
fans here in U tah,” senior center
Michael Doleac added, looking
in disbelief at the airport crowd.
“It’s unbelievable,”
said
sophomore forward Alex Jensen,
admitting he “couldn’t believe
(Utah had won) until there
was less than a minute left in
the game.”
The state’s chief Utes fan,

Gov. Mike Leavitt, also was
elated about Utah’s shot at its
first
NCAA
championship
since 1944.
“I can tell there’s only one
thing on the minds of Utahns
tonight, and that’s the Final Four
and Utes M adness,” he said. “I
think we’re in for a great week,”
he said.
Added Sen. Orrin Hatch, RUtah, from Washington: “It was
simply fantastic. If they play like
this against North Carolina,
nobody’s going to stop them.”
Anjee Barber, a pre-med
sophomore, is making plans for a
trip to the Alamodome. Reached

on the job at the Student Union,
Barber at first could only
exclaim: “Yay, yay, yay! I’m
going to San Antonio!
“I can’t believe we beat them
by the spread that we did. We
were completely underrated,” she
added. “We knew were going to
have to play well defensively,
and we did it. We totally did it.”
Barber said she called a friend
in San Antonio, and he planned to
sleep out Sunday night to buy
tickets to the Utah game for her
and her friends on Monday.
"Pretty much everyone I know
is going ... as many as we can to
cut down on gas,” Barber said.

Indians’ Wright and Mesa beat Florida Marlins this tim e around
VIERA, Fla. (AP) — The last
time Jaret Wright saw the Florida
Marlins, they were ruining the
masterpiece he pitched in Game 7
of the World Series.*"
A few months older and still
calling himself “a normal guy
who hangs out,” W right pitched
five one-hit, shutout innings
Sunday as the Cleveland Indians
beat the Marlins 6-0.
It was the first matchup
between the teams since Florida
clinched its first World Series
championship with an 11-inning
victory in Game 7. Wright, a

playoff hero at 21, allowed one
run in 6 1-3 innings and left with
a 2-1 lead.
Jose Mesa blew the lead in the
ninth, and the M arlins won it in
the 11th, keeping the Indians
without a Series title since 1948.
Wright didn’t recognize many
of the Marlins this time because
of the dismantling of the team
following the Series.
“There were a few guys I
remembered from D ouble-A ,”
said Wright, who struck out six
and walked two. “People know
that, it’s the Marlins, and you

might want to turn it up some.
People like to see those
rematches.”
How did it feel for Wright to
sit on the dugout and watch his
lead slip away five months ago?
“You can ’t im agine, and I
can’t explain it,” Wright said.
Wright got the victory Sunday
when Mesa finished the shutout,
retiring three straight after a
leadoff double by Ryan Jackson
in the ninth.
After the final out, many
Indians fans in the stands stood
and pumped their fists in mock

celebration.
“It’s no big deal,” outfielder
Brian Giles said, “It was just
another spring training game
against another team.”
Wright is back for his first full
season in the majors. He is
expected to follow Charles Nagy
in the rotation, but the Indians
clearly see him as their ace of the
future - maybe even the present.
“We’ve got a potential front of
the rotation starter in Jaret,”
general manager John Hart said.
“We’ve just got to finish him
off.”

Womack an anonymous star
still on faceless Pirates team
BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) —
Lou Brock. Vince Coleman.
Tony Womack.
W hat do these seem ingly
dissim ilar players have in
common? All won N ational
League
stolen
base
championships.
W hich raises this question
among some fans: Tony Who?
Womack, to those who don’t
know him, was the Pittsburgh
second baseman who made the
All-Star game in his first season
as a starter and was the first
Pirates’ player to win the steal
title since Omar Moreno in 1979.
Too bad it seems like hardly
anybody noticed outside of
Pittsburgh and his hometown of
Gretna, Va., which retired his No.
7 high school number last fall
in tribute.
Maybe it’s the curse of
playing for a small market team
that gets little national TV
exposure. Maybe it’s because he
plays on a young team that has
turned over its roster dramatically
and still lacks a national identity.
And maybe it’s because the
Pirates seem determined to get
rid of every single player
known outside of Pittsburgh’s
Golden Triangle. Remember last
season’s pickups of Kevin Elster

and Shawon D unston? Gone
and gone.
“People still think w e’re a
fluke,” said Womack, who had a
potentially breakthrough season
in
1997
after
toiling
anonymously in the Pirates’ farm
system for six years. “Everybody
was surprised when we were in
the pennant race all season, and
they’ll be surprised if we do it
again this season.”
Womack’s season — a .278
batting average, 50 RBIs, 85
runs, 60 steals in 67 attempts —
is the perfect exam ple of a
team not knowing what a
player would do until it gave him
an opportunity.
“He might have been our
MVP,” left fielder A1 Martin said.
Only the year before, the
Pirates downgraded the 5-foot-9,
155-pound Womack
as
a
prospect, and he won the second
base job last spring only because
nobody challenged him during
spring training.
Even now, there is talk that his
liabilities — he is an average
fielder, doesn’t walk much (43
times) and strikes out a lot (109)
for a leadoff hitter — make him
expendable as soon as prospect
Chad Hermansen is ready.
Yet the Pirates may find it

hard to dismiss a player with
Womack’s work ethic, his playevery-day mindset and, yes, a
stolen base percentage (.896) that
was the highest in major league
history for a player with so
many attempts.
“I didn’t set out to run, to steal
bases just for the sake of stealing
bases,” said Womack, who broke
the team record with 32
consecutive steals.
“I did it to manufacture runs
for a team that was expected to
have trouble scoring runs.”
Will he run more in 1998, if
only to pad his total so high that
it forces others to notice him?
“Only if the situation calls for
it. You don’t run just to run,” he
said. “You’ve got to know and
understand that it’s not all about
padding stats, it’s about having a
team w in.”
Womack insists will improve,
especially on defense, but not
because he is looking over his
shoulder at the onrushing
Hermansen.
“I’ve proven that I can play up
here, if not here then somewhere
else,” he said. “But you just don’t
want to live on the success
you’ve had in the past, you want
to keep building on and on until
you can’t go any more.”
