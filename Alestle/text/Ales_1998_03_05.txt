Change in tuition
reduces cost for outof-state residents
■ BY AMANDA
BARTON
NEWS STRINGER
A reduction in the cost of
out-of-state
tuition
was
approved at the February board
of trustees meeting. The onethird cut in cost will be
effective in the fall of 1999.
A ccording
to
SIUE
Chancellor David Werner, the
purpose for reducing tuition for
out-of-state students is to
encourage more students from
other countries to attend not
only SIUE but SIUC as well.
“Since many of our
students here (at SIUE) cannot
afford to travel abroad, I feel it
is very important to provide a
culturally diverse campus for
our students,” W erner said.
“Low ering the tuition will
enable
more international
students to attend SIUE
and SIUC.”
Most international students
do not receive any financial aid

from
the
government.
Therefore their families pay for
their education.
The
new
out-of-state
tuition rate will save nonIllinois resident students more
than $2,000 per year.
W erner also stated that
lowering out-of-state tuition
will
increase
student
enrollment from other states,
especially Missouri.
One Missouri resident and
student at SIUE, Time Riley,
said he was unaw are until
recently that the out-of-state
tuition would be lowered.
“When I went to get my
tuition calculation they did not
say anything about the tuition
being lowered,” Riley said.
Riley said that before he
found out about the reduction
he was considering moving to
Illinois to avoid extra expenses.
“Now it’s easier for me to
stay in St. Louis,” Riley said.
Illinois residents may
wonder
what
effect the
reduction in out-of-state tuition

will have on them. According
to Werner, “in-state tuition will
not be effected at all by the
reduction.”
R honda
W heeler,
an
Illinois resident and SIUE
student, said
she
thinks
lowering out-of-state tuition is
a good thing for all universities.
“When I was a senior, I
wanted to go to a school in
Missouri but could not because
it was
so
m uch
more
expensive,” W heeler said.
“Hiking up the cost to go to
school just because you do not
live in that state is stupid.”
W heeler also feels that
increasing international student
enrollm ent w ill benefit the
SIUE campus.
“I think that com ing in
contact with students from
other countries when you are in
college will eliminate culture
shock later in life, especially if
your career demands that you
work with people from all over
the world,” W heeler said.

Alestle Editor in Chief Danielle Belton
wins the Bob Hardy Scholarship award

Students volunteered to demonstrate the art o f
kissing in the Goshen Lounge this Tuesday. This event,
sponsored by the University Center Board was a
multimedia presentation by William Crane showing the
various ways you could show affection to your
significant other, as well as some differences between
women and men.

D anielle
Belton,
a
sophomore majoring in Mass
Communications was recently
selected as this year’s recipient
of the Bob Hardy Scholarship.
The
Bob
Hardy
Scholarship is a two-year
scholarship made possible by
the Bob Hardy fam ily for
students majoring in broadcast

journalism at SIUE.
Belton will be presented
with the scholarship by Bob
Hardy’s widow on April 22 at
SIUE’s alumni event.
“I’m really happy about all
this,” Belton said. “My parent’s
were really tickled about it. My
mother made me read the letter
over the phone.”
One of the reasons Belton
was selected to receive this
scholarship was the essay she
submitted for the scholarship.
In her acceptance letter Ralph

Donald, chairman
of the department
of
M ass
C o m m u n ica tio n s
said her essay
addressed
the
question
o f Danielle
integrity
which
Belton
Bob Hardy stood
for.
“This really helped me
rem em ber what I’m here
striving for,” Belton said, ‘I'm
really lucky.”

Thieves steal Ronald McDonald statue from a McDonald’s in Montpellier, France
MONTPELLIER,
France
(AP) — Four masked men in
black
and
white
costumes
slipped past customers and
stole a two-meter high (more
than six-foot high) Ronald
McDonald statue from a French
suburban M cDonald’s, police
said Tuesday.
Before making their escape in

a van with false license plates, the
thieves
scrawled
an
antiMcDonald’s message on the terrace
of
the
fast
food
joint
in Saint-Jean-de-Vedas, outside the
Mediterranean city of Montpellier.
“Humanitarian intervention.
Ronald McDonald rots away your
guts and pollutes your head. React.

Deliver
the
planet
from this blight,” they wrote
at the end of their Monday
afternoon assault.
This was not the first Ronald
attack
in
France.
Police
investigating the incident said that a
statue of Ronald was stolen from a
McDonald’s restaurant in the Paris

region in 1996. The thieves then
filmed a demolition session in
which the statue was destroyed
and sent the video to the
restaurant’s director, said a police
source, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
Investigators said, however,
that they were not excluding the

possibility that the Montpellier theft
was the work of a mysterious
commando group calling itself the
“Front for the Liberation of Garden
Dwarfs” who have operated around
France for the past few years,
stealing statues from back yards
then “freeing” them in forests.

Right, so what C o m m en ta ry------------------------------------------------------------------are you really?
Some looks can be deceiving.
N ot
too long ago,
someone
asked
me
what I was. I
thought it to
be
an
awfully
strange
question because I thought it
was a little obvious. Being the
flippant person I am at times, I
replied with the most obvious
answer, “I’m a woman.”
O f course, that wasn’t what
they were asking. They were
curious about my ethnicity. And
to me, their confusion on that
subject has always been the
most peculiar thing of all.
I was raised in a black
neighborhood,
with
black
parents and went to an all black
school at one point. I attended a
black church. It never occurred
to me that people could look at
me and see anything other than
a black person. Sure, I ’ve
alw'ays been on the lighter side
of the African-American color
spectrum, but surely everyone
could tell?
But the problem was, people
couldn’t tell. Since the eighth
grade, I’ve been called Puerto
Rican, hispanic, bi-racial, and a
few other ethnicities. I was
almost just as offended some biracial students were when
people referred to them as black
or “other.” I guess we all just
assum e it is som ething you
should just know.
It doesn’t bother me like it did
when I was in junior high. Now
it is actually funny, except when
people don’t believe me. They
look at my hair and skin tone
and egg on, saying,“Well,
someone in your family has to
be something else than black, so
what are you mixed with?” To
them, I do admit that I am
m ixed with something. It’s
called “slave master.” But that’s
another column.

Who won the latest Iraqi War?

Who won the latest Iraqi
War? CNN polls claim that the
U.N. and Saddam Hussein were
the two big winners. Others claim
that it was the Iraqi people. Few
have identified the real winner.
He is President Bill Clinton.
President Clinton was all set to
do what his polls told him the
American people wanted. Data
indicated that 76 percent of the
American people wanted him to
attack Iraq. Yet when he sent the
Secretary of State, the Secretary
of Defense and the N ational
Security advisor to a town
meeting at Ohio State University,
the world discovered a deep well
of anti-war spirit. The president
and his adm inistration were
stunned by the public’s reaction.
W herever members of the
adm inistration went, som eone
was screaming anti-war slogans
or asking anti-war questions. The
president realized at once that if
he pressed the country into war
his own poll ratings would suffer.
President Clinton’s personal
popularity prevents Congress
from beginning im peachm ent

proceedings. Since the country is
far from the next presidential
election, they believe that the
only other option to stop
President Clinton is to remove
him from office. To do this they
need an impeachable offense.
Prosecutors and reporters have
searched the entire Clinton record
from his days as governor of
Arkansas to his personal acts
while in the W hite House.
Without a criminal act, it is hard
for Congress to remove a popular
officeholder.
While I frequently disagree
President C linton’s political
direction, I strongly disagree with
those who seek to remedy the
situation through impeachment.
This is the same behavior as was
seen in the Old World when there
was strong opposition to the
K ing’s
political
direction.
Usually the opposition killed the
King and his family, installing
someone else whose political
direction would be more pleasing
to their interests. These changes
were often accom panied by
uprisings
by
the
K ing’s

supporters/subjects
and
the
killing of the political enemies on
both sides.
Our
Founding
Fathers
recognized the weakness in the
political systems found in the Old
World. They established written
rules so as to prevent that kind of
disruption in our political
process. Once the president is
elected they deliberately made it
difficult
to
change
administrations. Only four items
are listed in the Constitution as
grounds
for
im peachm ent,
Treason, Bribery, High Crimes,
and
M isdemeanors.
The
standards are so high that to date
no president has ever been
removed by Congress.
Staying in power is far more
important to President Clinton
than stopping Saddam Hussein.
He was not about to give anti-war
protesters the opportunity to drag
him down. Kofi Annan may have
saved the president from being
dragged into a trial by the United
States Senate and saved America
from facing a highly political
impeachment trial.

To be saved from the
em barrassm ent
caused
by
President William Jefferson
Clinton, all that America had to
give up was its self-respect and
its
international
political
independence. The public should
be ashamed of this president.
The damage he has caused to
A m erica’s position
in the
world is incalculable. He should
change his ways immediately. He
should put the welfare of the
country ahead to his own “place
in history.”
Until there is irrefutable
evidence, there should not be an
impeachment and Senate trial.
Neither should there be a forced
resignation.
Since
political
stability is essential to an orderly
America, Bill Clinton should be
permitted to finish his term in
office. Unless he refuses to act
like a president and continues to
be a liability to the country.

Government mole repudiates his allegations against FBI
CHICAGO (AP) — A former
government mole, just days after
attempting suicide for a second
time, has repudiated claims he
made last year that an FBI
agent had instructed him to
destroy evidence favorable to
A rcher D aniels M idland Co.
executives indicted in a federal
price-fixing case.
Based in part on the
allegations made by former ADM
executive M ark E. W hitacre,
attorneys
representing
two
indicted company officials have

asked U.S. D istrict Judge
Blanche Manning in Chicago to
throw
out much
o f the
government’s evidence.
Michael Andreas, on leave as
ADM ’s vice chairman and retired
ADM executive Terrance Wilson
are charged with conspiracy to
fix the $600 million world market
in lysine, a feed additive.
Whitacre, one-time head of
A D M ’s BioProducts Division,
turned cooperating witness in
1993 and was directed by FBI
agent Brian Shepard. For 2 1/2

years he secretly recorded
conversations and meetings in
which the scheme was discussed.
But after falling out with
Shepard, Whitacre filed a lawsuit
charging the agent with ordering
him to destroy tapes that might
exonerate Andreas and Wilson.
W hitacre pleaded guilty in
October to swindling ADM out of
$9 million. He is to be sentenced
Wednesday, nearly a week after
his original sentencing date was
delayed follow ing a failed
suicide attempt at his home in

North Carolina.
In a new affidavit filed by
federal prosecutors on Monday,
Whitacre discounted his previous
assertion that he had kept tapes
that might be detrimental to the
government’s case and sent them
to an associate to destroy.
“I did turn in every original
tape of ADM and its competitors
to the FBI with no exceptions,”
he said. “No tapes were altered
at any time.”
Whitacre said Shepard had
expressed disappointment when

taped
conversations
“were
positive for ADM” and that he
had m isinterpreted w hat the
agent had meant.
Whitacre added that the only
reason he claimed Shepard had
instructed him to destroy selected
tapes was because he thought if
he did so ADM m ight halt
a serious of lawsuits it had
brought
against
him
and
members of his family.
Manning is not expected to
rule on motions to suppress the
tapes until at least April.

Clinton cites 9-year old’s death in supporting lower drinking limit
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Citing the case of a 9-year-old
Maryland girl who was killed by
an out-of-control car while she
waited for a school bus, President
Clinton today added his voice to
a chorus urging states to get
tougher with anyone who drinks
and drives.
“Our nation will not tolerate
irresponsible
acts
which
endanger the lives of our
children,” Clinton told an
audience in the East Room of the
White House.
The president threw his
support behind a proposal in
Congress under which states
would be asked to lower to .08
percent the blood-alcohol level at
which a driver is declared legally
drunk or risk losing certain

federal highway funds. The limit
in most states is .10 percent.
“Lowering the limit will make
responsible Americans take even
greater care when they drink
alcohol in any amounts if they
intend to drive,” Clinton said.
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, DN.J., is the prime sponsor of the
proposal, which would be
attached as an amendment to a
pending
federal
highway
spending bill. The previous bill
expired Sept. 30 and Congress
approved
a
stopgap
$5.5
billion
measure
to
keep
highway programs operating
through May 1.
Clinton announced he was
asking Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater to conduct a study
on enforcing the .08 percent limit

on federal lands such as national
parks and military bases.
Currently, 35 states define
drunkenness as a blood-alcohol
level o f . 10 percent.
To bolster his argument for
tougher
drunken
driving
standards, Clinton cited the case
of Ashley Frazier, 9, who was
struck by a car and killed Dec.
22, 1995, while waiting for a
school bus outside her home in
Hempstead, Md. The driver had a
blood-alcohol content o f .08
percent, less than the legal limit
in Maryland.
A shley’s mother, Brenda
Frazier, who w itnessed her
daughter’s fatal accident, joined
the president,
along
with
highway safety advocates and
representatives from M others

Against Drunk D riving at a
ceremony in the W hite House’s
East Room.
"There is no one that will ever
convince me that .08 is not
serious
im pairm ent,”
Mrs.
Frazier said. “My eyes have seen
it, my ears have heard it.”
White House aides pointed to
a recent MADD survey that
showed nearly seven in 10
Americans favored a lower
blood-alcohol limit. Researchers
also said 53 percent of the 1,000
people surveyed said they
considered drunken driving to
be the nation’s No. 1 highway
safety problem.
The proposed change would
mean the difference betw een
imbibing five drinks in one hour

— such as 12-ounce beers or 5ounce glasses of wine — rather
than four drinks for a 170-pound
man with an empty stomach. A
137-pound woman would reach
.08 percent after three drinks in
an hour, sponsors o f the
amendment said.
In 1996, more than 17,100
people died in alcohol-related
vehicle crashes nationwide, about
41 percent of all traffic deaths,
officials estimate. Of the total
deaths, about 9 percent, or more
than 3,700, involved drivers with
blood-alcohol levels below the
legal .10 percent limit.
Supporters of the amendment
said studies showed that up to
600 lives could be saved annually
with a national .08 percent law.

Bisexual girl says she was forced off cheerleading squad
DENVER (AP) — The
mother of a former high school
cheerleader says her daughter
was forced off the squad because
she is bisexual.
In a written complaint filed
M onday with Denver Public
Schools, Carol Gutierrez said that
West High School cheerleaders
verbally abused her 15-year-old

daughter, Amber Gutierrez. The
complaint also says cheerleading
coach Susan Ewing failed to stop
the harassment.
Amber, a 1Oth-grader, said the
harassment forced her to quit the
cheerleading squad in December.
“Sometimes I feel like
everyone’s turned their back on
m e,” she said. “Before they

knew, everyone was cool to me.
After that, I felt like I was by
myself.”
After review ing G utierrez’s
claims earlier this school year,
West High Principal Irene Jordan
concluded that nam e-calling
regarding
A m ber’s
sexual
orientation might have taken
place. But she said Ms. Ewing

did not encourage the namecalling and did nothing wrong.
Amber made the cheerleading
squad in September, about
the same time news that she
was gay began circulating
throughout campus, according to
the complaint.
Amber said she went about
her cheerleading duties, but felt

she was being excluded from
practices. For example, she said,
other members of the squad gave
her wrong inform ation about
practice times and which uniform
to wear.
Carol Gutierrez also has asked
the American C ivil L iberties
Union of Colorado to look at her
daughter’s case.

Former Lincoln researcher accused in theft of historic documents
SPRINGFIELD, 111 (AP) —
Sean Brown made $6.50 an hour
when he started work as a
researcher for the state-sponsored
Lincoln Legal Papers project.
By the tim e he left* three
years later, he had stolen
numerous historic documents —
possibly hundreds — and sold
them for m ore than $40,000,
prosecutors say.
Am ong m any item s still
m issing are a receipt and a
request for the issuance o f a
summons that Abraham Lincoln
signed as an attorney practicing
in central Illinois before he was
elected president in 1860.
For Patrick Kelley, the
state’s attorney in Sangam on
County, which includes the
16th
p resident’s
form er
hom etow n o f Springfield, the

charges of w rongdoing were
particularly serious.
“We have for generations
basked in the reflected glory of
Abraham Lincoln and it’s really
a shame that it’s come to this,”
he said.
Brown, 29, o f Springfield was
released from M organ County
Jail on M onday after posting
$2,500 cash bond. He was to
appear in circuit court in
Jacksonville later today on
charges o f felony theft and
tampering with public records at
the county courthouse.
Brown was also charged
in Sangamon County with
felony theft for allegedly
stealing $10,000 to $100,000
in documents from the Illinois
Regional A rchives D epository
at
the
U niversity
of

Illinois-Springfield.
He also may face similar
charges in Montgomery County,
where
an
investigation is
underway, authorities said.
Tim
Huyett,
a
special
prosecutor who advises the
state’s financial crimes task
force, said no other arrests
are planned. But he said
some documents were sold to
an individual in New York and
later resold.
Brown has already made
partial restitution of $16,000
from the more than $40,000
prosecutors believe he netted
from his thefts, authorities said.
Officials have recovered about
140 missing documents, but it is
unknown how many he stole.
The Lincoln-signed items
were taken from the Morgan

County Courthouse probate
section that is normally closed to
the public. Brown was given
special access due to his
researcher’s position.
Cullom Davis, director of The
Lincoln Legal Papers, said a state
police investigation began after
some o f B row n’s form er co­
workers were doing a routine
inventory last fall of 140
documents bought for $10,000
last June by the Illinois State
Historical Library. They found
five documents were identical to
ones previously photocopied at
the
Regional
Archives
Depository.
“Most of my staff colleagues
are friends o f their form er
associate but without hesitation
they
put
integrity
and
professionalism and the project’s

welfare ahead of any personal
loyalties,” he said.
Prosecutors said they would
make a special effort to recover
all the missing documents, which
they said could number in the
hundreds.
Brown, who has an advanced
degree in history and prior
archive experience, worked
under contract from 1993 to 1996
with The Lincoln Legal Papers,
which is sponsored by the Illinois
Historic Preservation Agency.
The theft charge is punishable
by up to seven years in prison or
up to four years probation, up to
a $10,000 fine, plus restitution.
Tampering with public records
is punishable by up to three
years in prison or up to 30
months probation.

SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) —
Friction betw een a housing
development and a farmer over
the odor of hog waste has led the
Illinois attorney general’s office
to sue the farmer.
A ssistant A ttorney General
Jane McBride said Monday that a
lawsuit over odors is somewhat
unusual, but this problem has
been going on for nearly two
years without resolution.

“We have to proceed with
enforcement,” she said.
Alan D urkee raises about
2,000 hogs on a farm outside
Stronghurst, which lies near the
Mississippi River about 60 miles
south o f the Quad Cities.
The hog operation was built
near a subdivision — within half
a mile of some homes, McBride
said. Odors from D urkee’s waste

lagoons can be overpowering,
interfering with the homeowners’
use of their property, she said.
The lawsuit also alleges that a
company hired by Durkee to
dispose of hog waste made a
mistake and allowed waste to
pollute a nearby creek.
The attorney general wants the
court to order Durkee to stop all
violations and to pay up to

$50,000 for past violations, along
with $10,000 for each day the
violations continue.
But M cB ride said Durkee
has cooperated with the attorney
general’s office and an outof-court
settlem ent
might
be possible.
Durkee could not be reached
for comment. He has an unlisted
telephone number.

Jabs get personal in Democratic gubernatorial debate
CHICAGO (AP) — With two
weeks left until the March 17
primary, the four Dem ocratic
candidates for governor are
taking harsher — and more
personal — jabs at each other.
At another in a string
of debates, John Schmidt painted
Glenn Poshard as a puppet of
the gun lobby, then Poshard
took a swipe at Schm idt’s
Harvard background.
Schmidt, a form er Justice
Department official, Poshard, a
southern Illinois congressm an,
former Attorney General Roland
Burris and former U.S. Attorney

Jim Burns appeared Monday
on WBEZ radio at a forum
aired statewide.
Schmidt said Poshard had
caved in to the National Rifle
Association on the issue of
banning
assault
weapons.
Poshard had voted for an anti­
crime bill that included a ban
on assault weapons, but later
tried to repeal the weaponsban provision.
Poshard replied, “John, don’t
lecture me on standing up. I was
standing up for this country
10,000 miles away from home
in an Army uniform while you

SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) —
A man decapitated when run over
by, a train apparently lay down
on the track just as the
locom otive
approached,
Springfield police said.
“It would appear it was an
intentional act,” acting Sgt.
Joseph Curry said. He said the

though major airlines oppose it
because consum ers ultim ately
pay for air travel facilities.
Schmidt said airlines must
underwrite the construction
bonds, adding, “I think that may
be what the (Chicago) Tribune
meant when they said you
(Burris) don’t Offer credible,
specific answers.”
To a call-in question about
school taxes, Bums said he was
“the
only
candidate
who
consistently, throughout, has
said I will not raise the income
tax to fund education.” He
proposed that half of all future
state revenue growth be sent

to school districts.
Bums touted his platform of
“cleaner governm ent, better
schools and safer streets and
com m unities,” but he was
ignored in the back-and-forth
exchanges among the others.
Schmidt suggested Poshard
was hypocritical for spurning
cam paign contributions from
political action committees while
taking cam paign m oney from
General Assembly leaders. He
indicated Poshard is " a whollyowned subsidiary of M ike
M adigan,” referring to the
Chicago Dem ocrat who is
speaker of the House.

were at Harvard.”
Poshard enlisted in the Army
at 17 and served in Korea during
1962-65.
Schm idt
attended
Harvard as an undergraduate and
law school student, leaving with
a law degree in 1966.
Asked after the debate about
Poshard's Harvard jab, Schmidt
replied, “I sat there thinking if I
ought to reply to it, but I really
wasn’t sure what he meant.”
Schmidt also lobbed a shot at
Burris,
the
front-runner
according to media polls. Burris
said a proposed third Chicagoarea airport could be built even

as Warren Milbourn, 23. Cpl.
David Millsap said police were
told he was a Camdenton resident
who had been
living
in
Springfield recently.
The train, which included two
diesel units and 87 freight cars,
was heading to Memphis, said
Jerry Jenkins, director of media
and community relations at the
railroad’s headquarters in Fort
Worth, Texas.
The body was found about
150 feet east of the Broadway
Avenue crossing on a double­
track section that connects the
railroad’s west yard with its
Commercial Street yard and its
mainline tracks.
At that point, near the
Southwest Byproducts grain
elevator, trains move at no more
than 10 mph.

Project March 8 at 4 p.m. in the
Meridian Hall of the University

Project has seen great success
with an unconventional front
line of sax/clarinet, steel pans
and vibes/marimba performed
to perfection by Paquito
D'Rivera, Andy Narell and Dave
Samuels. With three others on
bass, piano and drums, the
group has created a niche all
their own by melding Caribbean
grooves, Latin finesse and jazz
improvisation into as feisty a
fiesta as instrumental music
can offer.

"Fugitive” spin-off deserves a..,
l y C n e y G tutce

■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR

At 20, Tavis Werts (pictured
back, far
right)
is the
youngest m em ber o f the
ska/punk/whatever band. Reel
Big Fish. The band has been
touring for over a year and a
half in support o f their gold
album “T\irn the Radio Off.”
How
do
you
keep
from getting bored on stage?
W hat do you do to keep
the show fresh?
We change the set list a bit.
Occasionally w e’ll throw new
songs in, try to choreograph
dances to the music, kind of
whatever hits us.
How do spend your money
on the road?
I buy a lot o f cds and a lot of
clothes. Way too many of both.
How old were you when you
went to your first show?
My first show ... I think I was ...
actually pretty old, I think I was
13 maybe 14. It was the second
year of Lollapalooza.
It seems like there are a lot
of younger kids at shows lately.
What do you think about that?
We’ve had some shows when
we’ve had kids in the audience
that can’t be much older than six.
And most o f them are there with
their parents. I don't know what

the change is. I didn’t even know
about shows when I was six. I
think it may ju st be that there
tends to be an older audience that
are taking their kids.
Do you have any pressure at
all to keep the show clean?
Occasionally Aaron will make
jokes or something about getting
f*cked in the ass. And then right
after some parent comes up with
some three-year-old kid saying
“Great show.” But, for the most
part we don’t really worry about
it because we figure th ey ’ve
heard it all before.
Now that you guys are rock
and roll stars, have you ever
been tempted to get away with
any Motley Crue-type antics?
Trash anything?
Not really. We trashed one
dressing room once, which was a
really bad idea. Leave it to our
manager to say something to set
one of us off like that. But, w e’re
all good kids.
What would the Reel Big
Fish comic book be about?
T hat’s a good question.
Probably about G rant saving
the world.
From what?
W hatever it is, he could
probably do it.
see FISH, page 12

If Hollywood were to make sequels to every
movie ever made, we could watch George Bailey
work at the Building and Loan for another 40 years
in “It’s Still A Wonderful Life.” No, it wouldn’t be
very interesting, but we could watch his life
progress. This is the feeling “U.S. Marshals” gives.
It isn’t very exciting or interesting, but it is a sequel.
The film , which Warner Brothers, actually
describes as a spinoff to 1993 hit “The Fugitive,”
has Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role as U.S.
Marshall Sam Gerard. Gerard and his team are in
search of another fugitive (Wesley Snipes). They
almost catch him many times, as the story slowly
(stressing slowly) unravels. Wesley Snipes is the
fugitive and ju st happens to be ex-m ilitary
intelligence. D oesn’t there seem to be a lot of loose
cannon, governm ent rogues running around in
films? You would think the government would be a
bit pickier in their recruitment.
So, as an added bonus jailhouse fave, Robert
Downey, Jr., is added to the team to give Jones
another adversary. There is no chemistry and the

the spinoff o f the hit film “The Fugitive.”
team of marshals lose their luster quickly. The
original “Fugitive” had Harrison Ford to root for. In
this film, I found myself rooting for someone to get
mortally wounded.
Stuart Baird’s direction lacks all the style of his
predecessor, Andrew Davis, even with a nearly
identical story. There is an escape scene, a big fall
scene, yadda yadda yadda. It is all old hat. The
script was written by John Pogue. This is his first
effort to make it to the big screen. He obviously
didn’t work very hard on it. It lacks the humor and
fun of the first movie. And the supposed shocking
twist towards the end of the film would not even
surprise someone with a weak bladder who had
missed half the film.
All in all, it’s a no-brainer. It’s not the worst film
ever made, but is one of the more blatantly obvious
attempts to make money from a sequel. Tommy Lee
Jones should not even think about an Oscar
nomination for his second (and hopefully last)
outing as a U.S. Marshall.
The film opens tomorrow in theaters.

Winners of the Mimi Zanger award announced
■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
Last month the winners of the Mimi Zanger
writing contest were announced. Rosem ary
Monaco, a graduate student in the English
department, won first place with her story “Girl
Missing.” Kathy Cook and Daniel Lewis tied for
second place.
The contest is in its fifth year at SIUE and is held
in honor of author Mimi Zanger. There were nearly
40 entries and English Professor Lloyd Kropp said
the winning entries were all very close in quality.
M onaco’s story is about the reaction of a town
after a young girl ends up missing. M onaco
received an honorable mention for a story she
entered in the contest last year and she said she

never expected to win this year.
“I hadn’t ever taken a fiction writing course until
Jeffrey Skoblow’s advanced fiction class last year,”
Monaco said.
She also received help from another of her
English professors, Alison Funk.
Monaco has not been writing fiction long, but
she has been writing all her life. She and her
husband had a regular column called “He said/She
said” in an Ohio newspaper and she has been
freelance writing for some time.
Her story is not necessarily based on real events,
but she did recall a girl missing in a neighboring
town when Monaco was quite young.
“I think that real life is more fascinating than
anything you can make up,” M onaco said. “I think
everything I write starts with a kernel of truth.”

■ BY WILLIAM TATE
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
W hat do you get when you
have a slew of people, a good
deejay, a talent show case, two
raw com ics, a bar and good
vibes? You have an event by 2
Strong Productions.
On Wednesday, Feb. 25 the
Gallery in Glen Carbon was jam
packed with people w ho did
something that SIUE students
don’t typically do. They made
things live.
This event was a cross
between the Apollo, D ef Comedy
Jam , Soul Train and those
m em orable sessions everyone
had in the high school cafeteria.
SIUE
students
Julious
Lawson and Maurice Rankin, the
founders of the production
company, 2 Strong Productions,
presented and hosted the first of
many promising events at The
Gallery. W ithout any support
from the university, Law son
and Rankin im pressively sold
over 200 tickets and gave a
rowdy audience a good time on
their own.
The talent show segm ent
consisted of five acts: two r&b
acappella performances, two rap
acts and a dancer. Out o f the five,
Aaron and K.G., a rap duo, left
the stage victorious. H ands
down, Aaron and K.G. gave the
crowd a top-notch performance
spurting out slick rhymes over
m elodious tracks. They had
everyone out o f th eir seats
chanting and dancing along. If
you like fast paced, get the girl,
grab the m oney and run
lyrics, definitely keep an eye on
these two.

The com edy segm ent was
hilarious. Even though there was
excess noise and num erous
hecklers, com edians D onna
M urry and Reggie Reg both
m anaged
to
give
good
performances. I think it’s safe to
say that the crowd was really
digging the sexual content from
both comedians. Overall, both
com ics
gave
top
notch
performances.
A fter the com edy segm ent
came to a close, the dance floor
was congested with wall-to-wall
“No Limit Soldiers” dancing to
their favorite No Limit anthems.
There was no static, tension, or
hassle within the crowd.
Keep a lookout for future
events
from
2
Strong
Productions and start supporting
students who are investing tons
o f energy
into som ething
everyone can benefit from. SIUE
students need to stop talking
about it and start doing it.
Because if we don’t support each
other, who will?
William
Tate
had
an
opportunity to have a question
and answer session with Julious
Lawson.
Q) What inspired you guys to
throw that event?
A) The campus needed some
excitement other than the Cougar
Den specials.
Q) Was that a one time deal?
A) Naw, w e’re definitely going
to continue.
Q)
How
did
2
Strong
Productions hook up with
the Gallery?
A) I met the owner awhile back
when we used to party there on
Wednesdays. I told him what we

wanted to do. O riginally we
wanted Twister to come down
here. We wrote him up a
few proposals and he decided
to go with the com edy-talent
show first.
Q) What can we expect from 2
Strong Productions in the
future?
A) W e’re going to start a
variety of things and take it to
different places.
Q) How often?
A) We’re going to try to keep it
going often you know? We don't
wanna wear it out by m aking it
tiring too quick.
Q) What is the biggest threat
towards an event such as you
guys threw?
A) People who are not coming to
have a good time. If yo u ’re
coming to have a good time,
there shouldn’t really be any
bullsh*t involved. But you have
people who aren’t trying to have
a good time who’s just there and
when they become involved they
can f*ck it up. Sometimes people
drink too much, get carried away
or don’t know how to handle
liquor and that f*cks it up for
the crowd.
Q) What are you trying to get
across to people?
A) Well, I want A frican
Americans to get together on
some more harmonic type of
sh*t. You know what I’m sayin’?
We need to have a closer bond
and start doing things on our own
and stop sittin’ on our asses
waiting for the school to do for
us. ’Cause the way it is now is
f*cked up.

Since you sleep on the bus
all the tim e, how do you find
space for privacy? In case
som eb od y w ould lik e to
b rin g som eb od y b ack or
so m eb od y w ould lik e to
spend a little tim e w ith
th e m se lv es, if you catch
my drift.
Well, for the m ost part we
all have bunks w ith curtains,
lik e a box c ar tra in . If
som ebody draw s th eir curtain,
we leave them alone. For the
m ost p art, we all have
g irlfrie n d s, e x c ep t fo r o u r
d ru m m er w h o ’s n e v e r the
bringing the girls back type ...
Once the bus starts ro llin g , no
one can h e ar w h at y o u ’re
doing.
So, I im agin e you guys
are pretty close-k n it. H ow do
you ta c tfu lly tell so m eo n e
th ey ’re not keeping up w ith
their hygiene?
H ey you stin k , u su ally .
There are certain th in g s that
involve tact and certain things
that d o n ’t. Like hygiene issues
usu ally d o n ’t. As long as
th e y ’re not a lot o f groupies
around or som ething like that.
We try to keep it b etw e en
ourselves.
Do you th in k
y o u 'r e

m issin g an yth in g b ein g on
the road w hen y o u ’re so
young?
O ccasio n ally , b u t fo r the
m ost part I ’m d o in g w hat

W e’re all e x p e c tin g our

that. I do n ’t know. W e’re all

Cougar wrestling send three to big show in Colorado
■ BY BRIAN
ANDERSON
SPORTS REPORTER
The Cougar wrestling team
took fourth place out o f nine
teams in the Midwest Regional
and qualified three wrestlers for
the National Tournament in
Pueblo Colorado on March 13 and
14.
SIUE had hopes of sending all
eight of its wrestlers to nationals,
but in this type of tournament,
there is a lot of pressure to win
and to keep the dream of
becoming an All-American alive.
All of the Cougar wrestlers knew
this and wrestled well.
“Overall, we looked good as a
team,” assistant coach Booker
Benford said. “Even the guys who
didn’t qualify looked good and
came out with a lot more intensity
and technique than they have all
season.”
One wrestler who looked good
was SIUE’s 158 pounder Titus
Taylor.
The
junior
from
Centreville, 111. came into the
tournament seeded third and
dominated his first opponent 16-5.

The final qualifier, Jessie
Montez, was voted into the
National tournament as a wild­
card bid after placing third in his
126 pound weight class. No. 4
seeded Montez defeated his first
opponent 5-3, but then lost to top
seed Matt Goodson of UCO, 13-8.
That loss placed M ontez in a
pressure packed situation, forcing
him to win or go home.
“Had I been on the other side, I
would have had a lot better chance
at taking first or second and not
having to worry about a wild card
bid,” Montez said.
Bouncing

more victories to take third place

Lowe, Harkins receive GLVC honors; Two seniors awarded
Clark named "Freshman of the Year” Great Lakes Valley
■ BY JASON
Conference honors
TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
The regular season and Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference
tournament are over for wom en’s
hoops and it is time to trade the
guts for the glory.
The conference’s 12 coaches
have presented
post-season
honors to three SIUE players
along w ith the rest o f the
GLVC’s notable talent for the
1997-98 season.
Junior Kim
Low e
and
freshman M isi C lark received
well deserved first team AllGLVC Conference accolades.
Lowe led the league in
rebounding and averaged a
double-double with 14.5 points
and 11.2 boards. In all three of

her performances in the GLVC
tourney she had 10-plus points
and 10-plus rebounds. In fact,
Lowe had a total of 16 double­
double games this season.
Clark, a senior ballplayer in a
freshman class, led the Cougars
in scoring with 18.4 points a
contest. Not only did she receive
all-star status, Clark
also
shattered the freshman scoring
record with 533 points and
earned Freshman o f the Year
honors. She also led the Cougars
in assists with 104, and steals
with 88.
“I thought she was well
deserved for Freshman of the
Year because of the way she
stepped in and handled the
pressure,” Cougar head coach
Wendy Hedberg said.
Senior Alicia Harkins ended
her last season by averaging 22

points a game in her last four
outings. The performance helped
her to get a GLVC honorable
mention. A ltogether Harkins
averaged a career high 16.2
points a game for the season
and pulled herself up on
SIUE all-time scoring list with
1,258 points.
“I ’m very happy for Misi,
Kim and Alicia,” Hedberg said.
“T hey’ve
all
had
out­
standing seasons.”
On top of all the individual
honors, SIUE broke the school
record for wins and left yesterday
for the NCAA D ivision II
tournam ent with their 22-7
record. M ichigan Tech (19-9)
is aiming to bring the Cougars
home early in the first round
of the tourney tonight. The
game starts at 7:30 p.m. in
Evansville, Ind.

After a run which saw the
SIUE m en’s basketball team
reach the semifinals of the Great
Lakes
Valley
Conference
tournament, two senior standouts
picked up All-GLVC honors.
Nathan Kreke and Rusty
Sarnes were recognized for
their outstanding play this
season when the league’s 12
coaches voted for the AllConference teams.
Kreke, of Effingham , was
named to the second team after
posting a career high 13;9 points
per game and 7.1 rebounds per
contest. This season Kreke
became only the second player in
school history to record 1,000
points and grab more than 500
rebounds over his SIUE career.
He also led his team with 23
blocked shots and finished No. 2
on the all-time career blocks list
with 54.

Sarnes, of Havana, received
an honorable mention as he led
the Cougars in scoring with 14.1
points per game. His three-point
shooting leaves him among the
all-time leaders at SIUE with 41
percent. Sarnes also displayed
his unselfish play by recording
63 assists, which was second
among the team.
Head
coach
Jack
M argenthaler
is
especially
pleased that these honors came
from the other coaches in the
league, since Margenthaler was
not allow ed to vote for his
own players.
“It speaks well for Nathan and
Rusty,” M argenthaler said. “It
shows what they’ve done for us
all season.”
SIUE finished the 1997-98
season with an overall record of
18-9 after they were defeated by
No.

U ndefeated in conference play, C ou gars looking f o r rep ea t o f g rea t season

Cougar softball team looking for spot in National Tournament
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
It is hard to com plain
when your team finishes the
season with a record of 39-13
and goes undefeated in 21
conference games, but something
was missing.
Head
coach
Sandy
Montgomery knew she had a
national tournament caliber team
last season, but a berth in the
tournament eluded them.
With an entire pitching staff
returning and a solid recruiting
class coming in, the SIUE
softball team is gearing up
to make a run for a Division II
national
tournam ent
berth
in 1998.
“We just have to win games
this year. M ost im portantly,
games within our region,”
Montgomery said. “We need to
play consistent softball, play
hard, take care o f business and
finish in the top tw o in the

conference and then we should be
where we want to be.”
An experienced pitching staff
will once again be anchored by
senior Deanna Smith, of Morton,
and junior Jessica Silbe, of
Pinckneyville, 111. Silbe posted a
20-6 mark last season with a 1.84
earned run average.
“Jessica
is a big-gam e
pitcher,” Montgomery said. “She
has good stuff and is a huge
competitor who loves to win.”
Smith, who went 13-6 with a
team -leading 1.38 ERA, will
bring back her effective low ball
pitching technique.
“Deanna is another big-game
pitcher who has great control and
keeps everyone behind her
sharp,” Montgomery said.
Sara Obrecht, a Gifford, 111.
native, and senior Stephanie
Stinson, of Cahokia, 111., will
also see their share of time on
the mound.
Behind the plate will be
sophom ore Kari Franzen, o f

Rantoul, 111. She was a teammate
of Obrecht’s in high school and
figures to play a vital part in
SIUE’s success this season.
“Kari has come a long way
and has improved drastically,”
Montgomery said. “She handles
the pitchers well, and we need
her to play strong defense, which
she is capable of doing.”
A strong foundation of
returning players also includes
first
team
A ll-Conference
outfielder Gwen Jackson, of
Collinsville, 111. Jackson will
anchor the outfield trio and see
time at second base. She led the
team in three categories last
season with a .333 batting
average, a total o f 37 RBI and 25
stolen bases.
“Gwen is a solid player and an
unbelievable
base
stealer,”
Montgomery said.
SIUE will fill the remaining
outfield spots with either Kim
Messinger, of Bridgeton, Mo.,
Kim Wagner, of Burbank, 111., or

junior Niki Mitts.
Messinger is in her third year
with the squad. She has a great
swing and a solid arm out in left
field. To help utilize W agner’s
great speed, she has been turned
into a switch hitter. She’s a slap
hitter who will see action at all
three outfield positions. Mitts is a
transfer student from Illinois
Central College. S he’ll add
power to the Cougar line-up and
a great sense of the game.
Team captain Erica Connett,
of Pekin, 111., is the lone returning
starter in the infield. She played
third base and hit .293 last season
with 26 runs batted in and
seven doubles.
The other com er will be filled
by Peoria new com er Sarah
Sollberger. She is a power hitter
who transferred from Illinois
Central College who will also see
time as the backup catcher.
The middle infield spots are
still up for grabs, but a pair of
freshmen lead the list to take

those positions. Mandy Uhrhan,
of
Dupo,
111.
and
Amy
Vandervinne, o f Moline, 111., are
both stable defensively.
“Mandy is a very good
defensive shortstop who can just
pound the ball,” Montgomery
said. “Amy is also a solid
defensive
player
who
is
extrem ely smart and a good
contact hitter.”
Also
available
in
the
middle infield are junior Ashly
Horton, of G ranger, Ind. and
freshman M yisha Sanders, of
O ’Fallon, Mo. and Troy, 111.
native, Cindy Kolda.
“All three girls are good
contact hitters who will give
us much needed depth in
the infield, and w ill be solid
base runners for us.”
SIUE opened the season with
a 2-1 record in the Southern
Classic last weekend. They host
the Cougar Classic this weekend
before traveling to Florida over
spring break.

Another ex-TCU football player
pleads no contest in assault
FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)
— St. Louis Rams offensive
lineman Ryan Tucker faces
sentencing next month for his
role in the 1996 beating of
a student outside a bar in
Fort Worth.
Tucker is one of two former
Texas Christian players who have
pleaded no contest to a charge of
aggravated assault in the May
1996 attack on Bryan Boyd.
Jury selection was to begin
Tuesday in the trial of the other
two players, W illiam Justin
Thompson, 23, and Jason
Howard Davem, 24.
James Porter McFarland, 22,
entered his no contest plea
Monday under an agreement with
prosecutors. State District Judge
Don
Leonard
scheduled

sentencing for April 13.
Tucker, 22, pleaded no contest
to the same charge last week.
He is scheduled to be sentenced
April 6.
Boyd, 23, suffered a fractured
skull and partial facial paralysis
in the fight. Boyd and his parents
have filed a lawsuit against the
four. The civil court case is
scheduled for trial in May.
Under terms of the plea
agreement, the attorneys have
agreed that M cFarland should
serve a five-year deferred
sentence and pay a portion of
the almost $10,000 in restitution
agreed to in T ucker’s plea
last week.
However, they disagree on
whether McFarland, who now
attends Stephen F. Austin State

University, should serve any jail
time for the assault.
Prosecutor David M ontague
wants McFarland and Tucker to
serve 30 days in jail. Defense
attorney Bill Lane said he wants
his client to serve no jail time.
T ucker’s
lawyer,
Bill
Magnussen, already has agreed
Tucker should serve a five-year
deferred sentence, pay nearly
$10,000 in restitution and attend
anger control and substance
abuse counseling.
Montague wanted Tucker also
to serve 30 days in jail, but
Magnussen argued that a jail stay
could jeopardize his ability to
play for the Rams.
Leonard has allowed Tucker
to return to Missouri.

There’s some good news for the
M ilwaukee Bucks.
Point guard Terrell Brandon
had the cast rem oved from his
sprained left ankle Monday. The
cast was on for two weeks.

his ankle for the second time
this season during a home game
against the

H eat.
Brandon first sprained the
ankle Dec. 11 and m issed seven
games. During Brandon’s most
recent absence, the B ucks

went 4-5.
With Brandon out, the Bucks
have gone with a point-guardby-committee approach. Coach
Chris Ford starts Elliot Perry,
then puts the play-m aking
duties in the hands o f Elliot
Perry, Ray Allen, M ichael Curry
and Litterial Green.
