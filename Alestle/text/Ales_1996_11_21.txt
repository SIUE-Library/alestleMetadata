Hitting phone fraud students where it hurts

SIUE officials ready to take action
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
Officials
at
S outhern
Illinois
U niversity
at
Edwardsville are taking a last
stand against stu dents who
have yet to come forward to
pay off a $450,000 phone
fraud debt.
Certified letters have been
sent out to 20 students, some
of whom are out of the
country.
The certified letters warn
students that if they do not
respond to the letter within 15
days the university will take
several
steps,
including
referring students to the Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
for violation of the Student
C onduct
Code.
“The
university is trying to take
steps in locating foreign
students. It is m ore difficult to

locate them ,” Sam Smith,
D irector of university news
services, said.
“W e’re working through
norm al contacts with foreign
students through certified
mail. If th ere is no reply,
sanctions
prohibit
those
students
from
having
diplomas or getting credit for
work done at the university,”
he said.
“It would be far b etter to
avoid prosecution. We hope
students com e forw ard and
pay the debt. The university
doesn't want students to go to
court, have jail tim e, o r pay
fines. W e’re try in g to avoid
th a t,” S m ith said.
Vice
C hancellor
of
A dm inistratio n K en N eher
would like to avoid sending
anyone to jail.
“We’re trying not to send
anyone to jail, but if we get a

crim inal case then we will
prosecute. We would like to
try to first recover the money,”
N eher said.
A question that is sure to
be on many students’ minds is
how the university will make
up
its
losses
if
the
adm inistration is unable to
reconcile the outstanding bill.
“We will have to pay the
money somehow. W here the
m oney would com e from is
yet to be d e te rm in e d ,”
N eher said.
He added police are
continuing their investigation
into the students who possibly
participated in the fraud, but
did not take p art of the
amnesty period, which ended
in March.
A total of $1.1 m illion
dollars was charged to the
university
during
the
p h o n e scam .

Steps university will take:
Prohibit students from registering for more
classes.
Withhold university records such as transcripts,
grades and diplomas.
Turn the unpaid bills over to a collection agency,
which will m ar the students’ credit records for
seven years.
Add the unpaid am ount to the students’
university accounts, and any financial aid checks
received for those students will be used to pay
the bills.
Students who owe the money, and currently work
for the university, will lose their jobs
After receiving certified letters, students will have
15 days to reply.

IKE provides students with several services
including movie previews and w hat’s new in
the world of music. IKE is owned and operated
through C am pus Interaction, a m edia
corporation that provides interaction services
to colleges in the U nited Stales.
“It doesn’t cost the university anything. It’s
sponsored through local, state and national
com panies,”
Jeff

a
sales
representative for Campus Interaction, said.
Some of the companies who are sponsors
for IKE include American Express, E A Sports,
Columbia House and MCI. MCI is providing
the data connection for IKE.
“It allows students to connect with campus
events and web sites,” Chris Barone, collegiate
m arketing for Campus Interaction, said.

Last year, IK E was installed at the
university but due to some problem s had to be
taken back.
“When we installed it, there were some

took IK E back to R& D (R esearch and

Staff is ill from food poisoning
NA SA’ s oldest shuttle soared into
orb it Tuesday, carrying the oldest person ever to fly in space, 61-yearold Story M usgrave.
Colum bia lifted off with a pair of science satellites at 2:55 p.m., a few
m inutes late because of a slight hydrogen leak in the engine
com partm ent. The 4.5-million-pound rocket ship pierced thin clouds as
it arced out over the Atlantic.
M usgrave broke the age record held by form er astronaut Vance
Brand, who was 59 when he flew in space in 1990.

International----------------------------------------Pope to visit Cuba after compromise
VATICAN CITY (A P) — In a stroke of brilliance or folly, Fidel
C astro won a long-sought pledge Tuesday from Pope John Paul II to
visit com m unist Cuba next year, capping a trium phant stay in Rom e by
the Latin A m erican revolutionary.
“The only thing missing is the date in 1997,” papal spokesman
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said. P reparation will begin “shortly,” he said.
A C uban stop in O ctober during an already scheduled trip to Brazil
was one possibility.
The Cuban leader apparently hopes Vatican influence can help ease
the 34-year U.S. em bargo against Cuba. The em bargo did not come
up during C astro ’s m eeting with John Paul, N avarro said.

M ETR O PO L IS (A P) — Every once in awhile, the
teachers and other staff m em bers at M etropolis Middle
School escape from cafeteria food and throw a potluck
luncheon in the teachers’ lounge.

Classes for the 150 students were canceled the first three
days of this week and Superintendent D on Smith said there
may not be enough teachers off the sick list to have classes
Thursday or Friday, either.
Six teachers rem ained in the hospital Tuesday.
Smith said that he was still awaiting results of laboratory
tests, but that it appears the culprit was a turkey breasl
roasted and smoked at a local barbeque place.
“Everybody who ate the turkey becam e sick,” Smith said
This included teachers, cafeteria cooks, secretaries and
m aintenance workers, many of whom developed urinary
tract infections in addition to having severe cramps, high
fever and dehydration.
Escaping the illness were two teachers who went home al
the lunch hour.

Letter to the editor

Focus on logical, rational thinking not emotion
I would like to thank Dr. Kimball for his
letter in the Thursday, Nov. 14 edition of the
A lestle regarding U C B ’s distribution of
condom key chains. N ot only does his
opinion “d en o te” interest in campus events
( by reading the new spaper), it also denotes
interest in the welfare of the student body.
However, 1 am concerned with the rationale
behind his proposal that “ UCB also pass out
‘Mace on a Key C hain’ so our lovely coeds
can p ro tect them selves from ping-pong
playing studs who just happen to have a
condom handy"’.
The distribution of the key chains at the
ping-pong tournam ent was in the interest of
providing prizes for individuals who
exhibited talent and skill in the event, while
still prom oting UCB as a sponsor of the
program.
On the o ther hand, the idea of mace

distribution, qu o ted above, has been
accom panied by rationale that assumes a
direct relationship between condom use and
violent sexual behavior. In no way does the
correlation follow in a logical manner. On
the contrary, most violent sexual offenders
do not even bother with such caution.
In the future, I would suggest that if an
individual has a problem with a campus
issue, that the problem s be addressed as
they exist.
Reduccio ad absurdum, the Latin phrase
for “reducing to the absurd,” does nothing
but incur the unnecessary em otional aspect
of hum an nature. R ath er than solve
problem s by em otion, let us all focus a bit
m ore on logical, rational thinking.

L e g a liz e c a n n ib is
Commentary by
Scott Anderson
Assistant Photo Editor
This editorial is in response to Jam ie Schm idts’ letter in the
Alestle Nov. 14th concerning the legalization of m arijuana. A t a
glance it is obvious that Jam ie has no first hand experience with
cannabis, and that the inform ation she used is based on whim and
propaganda, not fact. The only way to deal with this country’s
substance use is to deal in facts, rationally and intelligently. T here
are four things to consider when talking about legalization of
cannabis: its’ effects on the user, the user’s effect on society,
regulation and total costs and benefits.
What does m arijuana really do? C annabis sm oked produces in
most a euphoric feeling that is accom panied by expansion of
awareness of surroundings, som etimes with intense focus on the
specific. It is a difficult feeling to relate, in that it is com pletely
different from the drunk most people are used to. Alcohol
narrows and blurs, m arijuana opens and intensifies. As for Jam ie’s
claim of high addiction, R ichard E. Schultes, H arvard’s forem ost
ethnobotonist states, “cannabis is definitely not addictive”. Unlike
alcohol, cannabis is a benign plant, both in its’ physical effects and
its effect upon the user. W here those under the influence of
alcohol might be prone to violence, cannabis user’s are generally
calm, controlled and peaceful.
The effects of m arijuana use upon society have been small.
Never do we hear of a m arijuana crazed attacker running through
the streets, this is reserved for hard drugs like heroin and alcohol.
However, as there are at least 30 million consum ers of cannabis in
the U.S., a good portion of the country has been criminalized,
creating distrust of the legal system. Further, as adolescents start
to experim ent with m arijuana, they start to see that they have
been lied to in school about drugs, thus opening the door to
experim entation with harder drugs.
The inability to regulate the distribution of m arijuana is one of
the main issues of the anti-legalization lobby. This is nonsense. It
is naive to think that people d o n ’t use m arijuana because it is
illegal. A nyone who wants cannabis can get it easily. The law has
deterred no one. Through legalization the governm ent would be
able to have some control over quality, potency, and distribution,
albeit modest. This is better than the regulation we currently have.
Regulation would also allow for taxes that could go towards
education and counseling.
The societal costs of cannabis are, and will be, small. The cost
of education will be the largest expenditure. Like anything
cannabis must be used responsibly and adolescents must be taught
to make rational and educated decisions for themselves. The
benefits of cannabis are overwhelming. The tax revenue alone
would pay for any education and counseling. The medical benefits
of m arijuana are well known for sufferers of glaucoma and cancer
and could be used to treat other illnesses as well. Hem p is an
excellent source of fiber for clothes and paper and will elim inate
the need for logging. It will be an excellent alternative to cotton.
The courts and jails could be freed up from useless cases, and most
im portantly millions of Am ericans could be free to practice as
they please.
M arijuana was outlawed in the 30’s because of pressure from
the tobacco and textile industries because they feared com petition
from this useful plant. The “ War on D rugs” has failed, like
Prohibition. Alcohol is a far m ore dangerous and socially draining
drug, yet it is still with us. The use of cannabis is 10,000 years old
and will last another 10,000 years, legal or not, if our species lasts
that long. “Just say n o ” hasn’t worked. It is time for an educated
and rational approach to substance use. R ead up folks.

Life, love and AIDS: Original production to debut this
weekend at the Metcalf Student Experimental Theatre
By Corey Stulce
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
A ID S is a subject m any people do not
feel com fortable talking about, perhaps
because
th ere
are
so
m any
m isconceptions involving it. It is also a
subject which is often ignored, but
ignoring it will not m ake it go away.
U nfortunately, some do not realize the
effects o f A ID S until som eone they
know is infected.
“The Diaries of A dam and Steve” is
an original production which will debut
this w eekend at the M etcalf Student
E xperim ental Theatre. The play gives
au diences a chance to m eet som e
characters and becom e a little m ore

people turn their backs.
The show was w ritten by Jeffrey Yapp,
a th eater perform ance m ajor, who wrote
a few scenes last year for an A ID S
aw areness project, and decided to
expand them into a full length
production. “ It involves a gay couple
who m eet, fall in love, decide to share
their lives together, and then find out

and one was a close friend nam ed
Steven. “It’s about him and some
of the things he went through, and
how I dealt with it when they were
diagnosed and then coping when
they had died,” Yapp said.
Yapp wants the audience
to leave the production with a

personal effects of AIDS. “1 don’t

“People need to lead a responsible

to go through what my friends did,
which was their families turned

The muppets: I thought they were real

_
_ .' ■
Corey Stulce
Assistant Lifestyle
editor

Until I was
ab o u t
10
years old, I
believed in
t
h
e
Muppets
the sam e as
I did Santa
Claus, the

3 S 6 r
Bunny
or
th e
T ooth
Fairy. Okay, so I was never too
convinced about the Bunny o r the
Fairy. I m ean, come on, a giant bunny
giving out eggs and candy and a
w inged dam e sneaking into my
bedroom at night to trade my old
tooth for a quarter. Call me a skeptic,
but 1 was always wary of those two.
M aybe they w ere in cahoots. Anywho,
back to my point, I considered the
M uppets to be real.
\ discovered the truth about them
around the time when I started to
realize th at S an ta’s and M om ’s
h andw riting w ere aw fully sim ilar.
Also, S anta d id n ’t seem to be as
concerned about my behavior when I
would go and visit him at the local
m all as he did in those letters. I

happened to be watching a program
on PBS, I was a very cultured child,
w hen I saw a docum entary on
puppeteering.
A fter 1 w ondered a few seconds
about who those strange m en were
with their hands up Bert and E rnie’s
anal cavities, I realized they were
puppeteers. This dismayed me a bit,
since I had always longed to be one of
those kids on Sesame Street who got
to hug G rover or pull off B ert’s nose.
Did those kids realize the M uppets
w eren't real? However, I didn’t lose
my infatuation with the M uppets, in
fact, my love for them probably grew.
I decided to learn about the art of
puppetry and about the genius behind
the green piece of felt nam ed Kermit,
Jim H enson. A fte r m any failed
attem p ts at sock puppets, I knew
puppet construction was not for me. I
still followed the M uppets in their
many successful endeavors. Was there
any m edia they couldn’t conquer?
They had the movies, television,
album s and even a magazine. The
M uppets helped m e to find the
industry in which I w anted to work,
entertainm ent.
It was always a secret dream of
mine, even into adolescence, to work

with Jim H enson. I had always loved
writing, and I wrote many possible
M uppet movies in my head to present
to Jim Henson. Unfortunately, some
years back, H enson left our world
before 1 got to ever shake his hand. It
still saddens me to think of the joy he
could’ve brought to the world, but my
spirits brighten when I think of the
magic he m ade while he was still here.
W hat
is
it
exactly about the
M uppets which is
so special? There
is no answer I can
find. They are not
e l a b o r a t e
creatures, m ost
seem to be made
of
sim ple
m aterials. Even
now, though, it’s
hard to w atch
them
w ithout
thinking they are
really alive. I even
have friends who
are scared of the
Muppets. I think
it’s silly, but I have
a
good
time
teasing
and

torturing them.
Unfortunately, I haven’t m ade it to
Hollywood yet. I’m still trying to find
the Rainbow Connection. 1 would still
love the chance to work with the
M uppets, but it appears Journalism is
the path I’m on right now. O f course,
Kerm it, as the investigative reporter in
his trench coat and fedora was
my inspiration.

M ichelle Shocked com pilation, “ M ercury
Poise: 1988-1995.” H er eclectic stew of old-time
bluegrass, country, blues, and Springsteentinged rock provide the rhythm for Shocked’s
stark lyrics.
T here’s no special reason for the collection;
her record label is testing how the m arket
responds to her work still, before they release
a new Shocked album, coming soon.
The collection’s a rem inder for anyone who
listened to Michelle Shocked w hat all the buzz
was. Besides selections from her three albums,
“M ercury
P oise”
includes
S h o ck ed ’s
contributions to the “D ead M an W alking”

soundtrack and “Sweet R e lie f’ compilation.
T hey testify to the fact th at M ichelle
Shocked, whose album s get sold in the folk
section as often as not, has never let such things
as genre designations or audience expectations
get in the way of a good song.
Like Van M orrison, Shocked throws in the
bare essential sounds, just enough to tell the
stories that need to be told. W hether it’s about
the h o ttest m etropolis in the U.S. or the
coldest, w hether it’s about her grandm other or
a vagrant on the street, w hether it’s about
loving life or loving w orth leaving, Shocked’s
songs have that heart-on-the-sleeve quality, as
if every word was the closest to G o d ’s truth she
could find.
Shocked may have seen her heyday, lost in
the shuffle betw een Lyle Lovett and Tanika
Takiram. Today’s world may be too beat-driven
to listen to the words of a song. But, back when
people tried to sing along with m ore than the
chorus, Shocked showed them how it’s done.

Volleyball's second season ends in semi's of GLVC tourney
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
For a second year team , the SIU E
volleyball squad played like veterans.
"I' m very pleased," head coach
Sandy M ontgom ery said. "We are a
second year team that is one of the top
team s in the conference."
The Cougars had high expectations
going into the conference tournam ent
last weekend.
But in the semi-finals, the Cougars
fell to N orthern Kentucky.
In th eir first m atch, S IU E beat
B ellarm ine 15-2,15-8,15-10.
M ichelle G ilm an put away 15 kills

on 29 attacks for a .310 hitting p er­
centage. She also contributed three
blocks against Bellarmine.
Julie L itteken helped out from her
outside hitting position with a .467 hit­
ting percentage.
Next up was the semi-final m eeting
with the No. 1-seed in the G reen
D ivision, N o rth ern K entucky. The
Cougars lost a hard-fought battle 1513,16-14,15-7.
"We played well, but couldn't get
any breaks," head coach Sandy
M ontgom ery said. "I felt like we could
have won, and who knows what would
have happened if we m ade the finals."

Yvonne Welch, a senior from Pekin,
led the team in kills in the m atch with
19 and had 25 digs to her credit. Welch
ends her SIU E career ranked 11th in
the country in digs and owns the SIU E
record in digs with 1,055.
Litteken hit .423 against N orthern
K entucky and finished her season
ranked eighth in hitting percentage
and sixth in blocks in the GLVC.
Gilm an had 11 kills on 28 attem pts
in the N orthern Kentucky match. She
concluded the season leading the con­
ference in both kills and blocks and
was third in service aces.
G ilm an also was honored as the

GLVC Player of the Year, and
L itteken joined her on being selected
to the all-GLVC team.
"Michelle and Julie were the most
consistent players on the team , they
were our "go-to" people offensively
and defensively," M ontgom ery said.
The Cougars finished their season
with a 22-15 record and a 12-4 confer­
ence mark.
"We gained a lot of m aturity this
year, and our level of play was much
greater as a whole," M ontgom ery said.
"We have everyone com ing back
except Yvonne, so we should remain
com petitive in the coming years."

Cougars rack up home victories
Defense propels
men in victory
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
Aggressive defense propelled the SIUE men's basketball team to a 87-80
victory Tuesday night against Olivet-Nazarene at the Vadalabene Center.
The Cougar defense held O livet-N azarene to only 24 first half
points thanks to the rebounding of R onnie H enderson, who had 5
boards, and Travis W allbaum who grabbed 6 from the glass.
Jason Holm es led both team s in scoring with 27 points in 32 m in­
utes on the court. H enderson threw in 17 points and went 7 of 13 from
the field, while Rusty Sarnes went 9 of 10 from the free-throw line to
contribute 10 points. W allbaum also added 10 points in 16 m inutes of
play.
"We played exceptionally well on defense," head coach Jack
M argenthaler said. "We showed a trem endous im provem ent in our
rebounding, but our offense w asn't in sync."
SIUE shot 41 percent from the field and 78 percent from the free-throw
line.
The Cougars will try to add to their 2-0 record when they travel to
Kirksville, Mo. for a game with Truman State University on Saturday after­
noon.
Scott Anderson / Alestle
"Truman State has good outside shooters and a lot of size up
Ronnie Henerson puts up a shot in Tuesday nights game against Olivet-Nazarene at
front," M argenthaler said. "Both team s have similar styles of play, so
the Vadalabene Center. The Cougars won the game 87-80
it will be a m atter of who executes b e tte r."

Women blow past Oakland City 81-54
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
The SIUE women's basketball team opened up their
home schedule with a victory Tuesday night at the
Vadalabene Center 81-54 against Oakland City.
- "I thought we played a notch above them,"
head coach W endy H edberg said after the game.
Leslie Phillips led the Cougars with 20 points
and 9 rebounds. Fifteen of her points came in the
first half. She was followed by four o th er team ­
m ates with double figures in scoring.
Except for the brief m 6m ent when O akland

led 2-1 in the first two m inutes of the game, the
Cougars never trailed in the game.
The Cougars went on to take a 42-26 halftime lead.
From there the Cougars continued their offen­
sive dom inence but H edberg stresses that they
need to keep improving on defense.
"I'm pleased with our perform ance. W e're
doing things well but I will harp on this all year
that we should be doing b etter on defense,"
H edberg said.
The Cougars w anted to improve on turnovers
from last Friday's game and they did just that.
O ne of the reasons for the turnovers might have

been from the transition of losing point guard
Terri Evans to graduation.
But Amy M azner has slid in and filled the posi­
tion nicely.
"Amy has stepped up and has done a real good job.
Of course Evans is a big loss for the team but Amy has
stepped up and took the role," Hedberg said.
For the game, the Cougars shot 46.8 percent
and out rebounded O akland 52-38.
Christina Loomis, Alicia Harkins, Beth Brown
and Kim Lowe also hit double figures in points.
The Cougars will travel to the Missouri Rolla
Tourney which takes place on Nov. 30-Dec. 1.
