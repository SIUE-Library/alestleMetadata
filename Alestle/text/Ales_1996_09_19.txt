Students face long wait for Commons' computers
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
Residents of Tower Lake are learning a lesson in sharing and they aren’t very
happy about it.
With only eight com puters in the Commons, the 1,282 students residing at
Tower Lake are encountering lines when they need to get on a computer.
TV R m ajor K erri M anion lived at Tower Lake in the past and still feels
strongly about the com puter situation in the Commons.
“T here was always a problem . It was busy, printers were broken and people
at the front desk knew nothing,” she said.
Things haven’t changed m uch since M anion m oved out of Tower Lake last
year. Students are com plaining about the same problem s.
Jerem y Lincicum, a th eater m ajor on the University H ousing Advisory

Com m ittee, said the current num ber of com puters is not acceptable. “T here are
not enough (com puters) to accom m odate the population of Tower L ake,” said
Lincicum.
H e suggested doubling the am ount of com puters in o rd er to minimize the
wait. “A nd if they are going to supply com puters, there should be a lab
assistant.”
As soon as C lara W arren, a music education graduate assistant, moved into
Tower Lake she noticed a problem in the Commons. “T here are not enough
com puters,” she said. “T here is always a wait. I can’t imagine what it will be like
during finals.”
Robin Smith, an education major, said, “Everybody is on the Internet, so you
can’t type your paper.” She said the com puters are occupied 24 hours a day.

SIUE Foundation plants seed for arboretum project
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
A dream of a 26-acre arboretum with a pond,
native species plantings and walkways is finally
underway ten years after the university’s board of
trustees first approved the project. Dr. Frank
Kulfinsky and others in the biology departm ent,
kept the project going during this time.
D an Sullivan, director of m ajors’ gifts at S IU E ’s
Foundation for the past two years, said he wasn’t
sure why there was such a gap in time, but guessed
it was a lack of private funding.

A word from Student
Government AND
Melissa Mills strikes
back at Alestle critic.

“N othing could be done with state money, and
we were finally able to raise some funds. So I guess
you could say it was an idea whose time and money
had com e,” Sullivan said.
The arboretum is nam ed for the late D onal G.
Myer, one of the first faculty m em bers at SIU E
and a form er dean of the School of Sciences. M yer
had spent much of his research years at SIU E,
Sullivan said.
The arboretum is located betw een the Trace
and N orth University Drive, bordered by the
Tower Lake R ecreation A rea parking lot on the
south and Tower Lake Housing R oad on the north.

CHICAGO — Illinois will join 15 other states in suing the
tobacco industry to recover millions of dollars in taxpayers’
money spent treating smoking-related illnesses, Attorney
General Jim Ryan said Tuesday.
The lawsuit, which will be filed in the coming weeks, will
allege that tobacco companies conspired to hide information
that nicotine is addictive. He also proposed state legislation
requiring tobacco vendors to be licensed, and banning the
sale of tobacco products from self-service displays in stores.
The proposed legislation would also increase penalties on
retailers who sell tobacco products to minors to as much as
$500 to $1,000. Minors caught buying tobacco products would
be required to spend up to 100 hours in community service or
in an education program on tobacco risks.

WASHINGTON—In a decision cheered by Republicans, a
nonpartisan commission recommended Tuesday that Ross Perot be
denied a spot in the fall presidential debates because he has no
realistic shot at winning the White House. An outraged Perot vowed
to sue.

International________________________
Yeltsin’s hospital stay to be longer for test
MOSCOW—Boris Yeltsin’s stay in the Kremlin hospital has been
extended, possibly until the end of the week, while he undergoes tests
in preparation for heart surgery.
Yeltsin, 65, has been in the Central Clinical Hospital since Friday
night, when he was admitted without public announcement.
He met there Tuesday with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
In brief footage shown without sound on Russian television, a smiling
Yeltsin shook the prime minister’s hand and gestured as they sat
talking.

Suspect arrested for murder of woman
EDWARDSVILLE — A suspect was arrested Tuesday in the
killing of an East Alton woman whose body was found early
Friday near Illinois Route 111. The Greater St. Louis Major
Case Squad declined to give details about the man, or say if any
others would be arrested for the murder of Toni VanDee, 28.

Since there is no attendant in the com puter
area, students who encounter
com puter difficulties are at the mercy of other
students to help them solve their problem s.
A lso, residents say, there is no one to inform
when a com puter breaks down.
Julia W hitehurst, a business m anagem ent
major, said, “I d o n ’t see why there can’t be
m ore com puters available w hen I’m sure that
w e’re paying for the service of the lab and
can’t even use it.”

have to wait for transportation to and from

With time being extrem ely valuable, some
students are asking p aren ts to purchase
com puters for them as gifts. Chris Clayton,
T V R /journalism major, is relieved that he
finally received a com puter of his own.
Clayton encourages others to do the same,
if possible. R egarding the com puter lab at
Tower Lake, he said, “They need to update
the softw are and increase the num ber of
com puters. In general, the lab is not wellm aintained.”

Counseling Services offering
student survival group
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor

THE OKTOBER CAREER FEST AND VOLUNTEER FAIR

L ast Tuesday, C ounseling Services began a student
survival group designed to help students discuss and resolve
issues which m ay interfere with their ability to graduate.
C ounselor G loria A. W alker explained the essence and
intent of the survival group.
“The group is for those students who are experiencing
academ ic difficulties,” W alker said. “It’s a student group
session. They run the group. Students are able to piggy-back
off of one an o th er.” T he idea cam e about from a
brainstorm ing session the office had last year on how they
could b etter help students.
This is the second year for the survival group. A t this
year’s first m eeting, the group had only one student in
attendance, but W alker is not concerned.
“Last year, at our first m eeting, we had only one student
but by the end of the semester, there were fifteen,” W alker
said.
W alker also said that once the word gets out on campus
about the program , m ore students will show up.
“We also receive stu d en ts who are sent to us by
(university) housing and o ther departm ents on cam pus,”
W alker said.
To get further ideas, students were asked during Welcome
Week to m ake a list of what new students should know in
order to have a sm oother college career. O n the “ top ten ”
list w ere things like developing good study and tim e
m anagem ent skills, m aking friends, and getting involved in
campus activities.
C ounselors who attend the meetings are only there to
help if needed. W alker also said there is a possibility the
survival group will be held during the spring semester. The
sessions are scheduled every Tuesday through D ecem ber 13,
1996 at 2:30 p.m. until 3:30 p.m. in the Peck Building Room
0314. Individual counseling is also available.

a L A R G E sum of money. Now w e’re not
talking lottery or anything, but it will be
m ore than normal. (Like nine bucks versus
the one you had to survive on all last week.)
Be very wary of waif-like students chained
to vending machines who are all of a sudden
offering favors-for-under-a-buck.

If your birthday is this week: G ood, good,
good, good vibrations... The w eek’s been
halfway decent already. Expect an even
b etter weekend. Especially if your birthday
falls on Friday.
Aries (March 21-April 19): Your aura has
been looking a little scraggly lately. M ake
time for yourself. You are entirely too busy,
Take a break. N urture that raggedy aura of
yours.
Taurus (April 20-May 20): R em em ber the
last excuse you were given? It was a lie. Not
a big one. But still a lie. Do som ething about;
it. But d on’t be top drastic.
Gemini (May 21-June 20): Som eone is
bound to question your string o f excuse«.
G et ready. It will happen very soon. Sooner
than you expect. Take the bull by the horns.
Cancer (June 21-July 22): Be careful when
you walk out to your car tonight. A crazy
colum nist ju st m ay be lurking in the
shadows. Pack a helm et in your backpack
next to your lunch.
Leo (July 23-Aug.22): Stand up to that
person who’s been getting on your last nerve
since day one. If sarcasm doesn’t work, try
offering your lunch at that irritating person’s
feet—the lunch you’ve already eaten, that is.
Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): C assiopea sees a
Pepsi in your future. A chilly, bubbly Pepsi
with beads of sweat dripping lightly down
the side of a huge glass. C assiopea also sees
you daydream ing a lot in an S IU E
classroom.
Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): You will com e into

It seems th at youth
Has been way too short
Com pared to the long
Stage o f adulthood,
I can never tu rn back
To the innocent, blissful
Tim e o f youth, b u t a
New bliss awaits me,
And I await it,
Anxiously.

It is tim e to fly
Into a world
I’ve never known;
A world th at’s large
And scary to me,
But I’m ready—
Ready to live,
Ready to learn,
Ready to love,
The game o f life.

ber of schools. Ft. Wayne and
Lewis are two of them and I
do n ’t know how long the list
goes on,” Logan said.
This definitely puts a
cram p in L ogan’s plans and
he hopes to . have this all
resolved by next Friday when
they have to play preseason
favorite, Indianapolis.
“We played really well last
w eekend despite not having
Yutaka. B ellarm ine is one of
the top team s in the league
and we played them close at
every m atch. W hen we get
Y utaka back she will m ake
our team b etter,” Logan said.

A simple kick back to their goalie
proves to be disastrous for the SIU E
M en’s Soccer team in a 1-0 loss to
E a ste rn
Illinois on Tuesday in
C harleston, 111.
The Cougars were ranked 16th in the
nation by the N ational Soccer Coaches
A ssociation
of A m erica
NCAA
Division II poll, going into the contest.
The two team s played an even game,
but a m istake by the C ougar defense put
the ball into their own net.
D efender D oug H artm an played a

bouncing ball back to goalkeeper Andy
K orbesm eyer who tried to play the ball
with his head. The rule stating that
goalies cannot use their hands on a ball
played back to them by their own team
m em ber, kept Korbesm eyer from catch­
ing the ball. The ball deflected off of
K orbesm eyer’s head and into the goal.
“M isjudgm ent can be p art of the
game,” said head coach E d Huneke.
“We had a good run at them , but the
breaks just didn’t go our way.”
D e fen d er B re tt D arb y played a
strong game to keep E astern Illinois
scoreless until midway through the sec­

ond half. The loss takes the C ougar’s
record to 3-2.
“I ’ve seen many strange goals,” said
H uneke. “B ut this one ranks among the
m ost bizarre.”
Ju nior D arren Snyder rem ains as
S IU E ’s leading scorer with three goals
and two assists. This puts him sixth
am ong the latest GLVC scoring leaders.
S IU E will now focus on G reat Lakes

Unlucky Number 13
brings good fortune
I for women’s soccer
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor

Scott Anderson /Aleslie

The SIUE women's soccer team at press time was winning 6-0
by half-time in a home game against MacMurray College
Wednesday night. The Cougars play Bellarmine this Saturday.

The w om en’s soccer team
started out the week ranked
as the No. 13th best N C A A II team in the countty.
A fter a 5-5 overtim e tie
with then No. 1 regionallyranked Lewis University and
a 1-0 win over the University
of W isconsin-Parkside, the
C ougars found them selves
rem aining in the 13th slot.
W hat helped the Cougars
cause was an early defeat of
the th en No. 5 nationally
ranked M ercyhurst.
The Cougars have played
some tough team s early on in
th eir schedule and so far
have responded very well.
“We will soon find out if
the top ranked team s that we
have beaten were as good as
they were first perceived to

be, or w hether it was us rising
to th e occasion w hen we
needed to,” head coach Brian
K orbesm eyer said.
The C ougar squad is full
of enthusiasm . A lot of this
em otion is brought on by the
new incoming freshm an and
then surfacing in the older
players.
“We are a team full of
enthusiasm . W e’re all getting
along and playing like there
is nothing to lose and that
may end up being one of our
biggest
w eapons,”
Korbesm eyer said.
A fter W ednesday’s game
with M acM urray the Cougars
will
play
und efeated
Bellarm ine at hom e at 1p.m.
“This will be another test
for our team ,” Korbesm eyer
said. “O ur schedule is tough
and this game is a big one.”
