NAACP leader will call for action with East St. L
A l e s t l e S t a ff R e po r t

The 16th season of the Arts and Issues series continues
with a visit from former congressman and current leader of
the NAACP Kweisi Mfume.
Mfume will discuss “Five Points to Freedom,” his
action agenda that includes civil rights, political
empowerment, excellence in education, economic
development and youth outreach.
Mfume became chief executive officer of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in
February 1996, after giving up his seat in the House of
Representatives. He also served 10 years in Maryland’s
7th Congressional District.
Mfume has been a long-term activist for civil rights.
While serving on the Baltimore City Council, he worked to
diversify government, improve community safety, enhance
minority business development and remove city
investments from the apartheid government of South
Africa.
In 1986 Mfume was elected to Congress, where he
consistently advocated landmark minority business and
civil rights legislation. He co-sponsored and helped pass
the Americans With Disabilities Act and also authorized
minority contracting and employment amendments to the
Financial Reform and Recovery Act.
Mfume later served two terms as chair of the
Congressional Black Caucus and later served as the

While the United States

SIUE associate professor and chair

Tanzania and Zanzibar that had the

As election monitors, Browne

delegation from the International
Foundation for Election Systems in
Washington, D.C., checked for fraud
and other improprieties at the polling
places in the hopes of preventing
conflict.

A $276,000 federal
appropriation to fund the
expansion of a teacher quality
initiative will help unit^ SIUE
with the East St. Louis school
district.
The money, which will be
part of the budget for the new
fiscal year, will be used to create
a program linking East St. Louis
public schools and SIUE in an
effort to better prepare students
to become teachers.
Rep. John Shimkus, RCollinsville, sponsored the
funding, which passed through
both the House and Senate Dec.
15. Shimkus had submitted a
proposal for $300,000, but
$24,000 was cut before it
passed.
“We are grateful to
Congressman Shimkus for his
continued support of SIUE,”
Chancellor David Werner said.
“His efforts in obtaining this
funding will go a long way in
furthering educational training
for Southwestern Illinois.”
Mary Polite, dean of the
School of Education, said that
improving teacher quality has
become an issue of national
recognition.

roughly 5 a.m. They
checked, among other
things, to make sure
the ballot boxes were
empty when the polls
opened and that the seals were placed properly on each
box to prevent any type of fraud or tampering.
“We also kind of monitored the actual process itself
to make sure that people who were registered to vote were
permitted to vote and were not turned away for fraudulent
reasons,” Browne said.
The group maintained communication with both the
incumbent government and the opposition, allowing them
to voice any concerns they were having about the process.
While the group did not stop anything from happening, it
recorded complaints and reported them to the electoral
commission.
“We did not report anything to the press because
some of the claims could not be substantiated and were
potentially inflammatory,” Browne said. “There was the
possibility for widespread violence if the wrong things
were said and done.”
Browne said despite the many possibilities for things
to go wrong, he was moved by the general attitude of the
people regarding their right to vote.
“I saw people walk miles and miles and stand in line
all day in unbelievable heat in order to vote,” he said.
Also for the election, illiterate or impaired people
were allowed to have assistance to prevent mistakes.
Browne said those helping would wait all afternoon to
help someone else vote and then go back to the end of the
line and wait again to cast their own vote.

The SIU School of Medicine
will be expanding thanks to $1.75
million in funding passed by
Congress.
Rep. John Shimkus, RCollinsville, sponsored the
proposal.
The funding, approved as
part of the federal budget Dec.
15, will be put to use through the
university’s Telemedicine and
Rural Health Initiative. The
program is committed to
developing and applying
information technology and
resources to medical education,
biomedical research and patient
care.
The school has been
involved in telemedicine projects
for several years, but these were
limited due to the cost of the
technology and the large service
area. The university has felt
renewed pressure to increase
telemedicine services and build

on existing developments, such
as the growth of the Illinois
Century Network and the
Internet.
“I want to thank
Congressman Shimkus for his
support of SIU,” SIUC Interim
Chancellor John Jackson said.
“The School of Medicine is a
leader in telemedicine, and this
grant will strengthen that
leadership role.”
SIU President James E.
Walker expressed gratitude as
well.
“This funding is critical to
the medical school’s mission to
help provide health care for the
3.4 million citizens of central and
Southern Illinois,” Walker said.
“We are very thankful to
Congressman Shimkus for
helping us obtain these funds to
improve our health care delivery
system.”
Carl J. Getto, dean and
provost of the SIU School of
Medicine, explained that the
funding will be used to establish

electronic links with health care
providers, which will help
promote better health care for the
people within the service area. It
will also be used to serve the
needs of the medical school and
residency
curriculums.
Eventually, the money could be
used for medical research and
patient care.
Most of the funds will be
needed for the wiring and
equipping of an expanded
telemedicine network. The
equipment will give medical
students and resident physicians
access to information resources
relating to biomedical research
and medical practice.
According to Getto, the grant
will not only help the university
but the members of the
surrounding communities as
well. Some money will be set
aside to create Community
Technology Partnerships, which
will provide technology grants to
health care providers in rural
areas for startup costs or
improvements.

SIUC chancellor will retire after 32 years
M ik e T erry
N e w s R e po r t e r

SIUC Interim Chancellor John Jackson has
announced plans to retire when a new chancellor is
found rather than pursue the job himself.
“I have been heavy into administration jobs for
a very long time and this is more than I would care
to perform,” Jackson said. “It will be good for the
university to have a new face.”
Jackson began his career at SIUC in 1969 as a
political science professor, and has not ruled out the
possibility of returning to that job part time.
During Jackson’s 32 years at the school, he
served as the faculty senate president, dean of the
college of liberal arts, vice chancellor of academic
affairs and provost.
He became the interim chancellor in June 1999,
filling in after managerial conflicts between SIU
President Ted Sanders and then-Chancellor Jo Ann

Argersinger led to her removal by the board of
trustees.
Sanders, who originally recommended Jackson
as a permanent replacement, resigned in February
to take a job with the Education Commission of the
States in Denver, further delaying the search to fill
the position.
James E. Walker became SIU’s president in
October and vowed to make finding a chancellor for
the Carbondale campus his first order of business.
He took the first step last month when he named a
14-member advisory committee of faculty, staff,
students and alumni that will begin a national search
as soon as possible.
The committee will meet for the first time
Thursday, when it will specify candidate
qualifications.
According to Jill Adams, chairperson of the
committee, the hope is to find someone by July 1.

Staff and faculty are people too
I appreciate our faculty and staff.
I hope I am not the only person on campus
who can say this. As I see it, we need each
other. Without students, faculty and staff
members don’t have a job, and without faculty
and staff members, we don’t have a school.
Having said that, I think SIUE faculty and
staff members are getting the shaft. It made me
realize that we should not take some things for
granted.
As a student, I have full rights to use the Student Fitness Center
and the equipment there. That cannot be said for the faculty and staff.
They are required to pay $135 per year to use the facilities in the
Fitness Center.
1 think that is just plain wrong. I asked around about this and got
a reasonable answer why faculty and staff members have to pay, but I
don’t agree. Here it goes.
Students must pay fees when they come to SIUE, and some of
that money goes to the Fitness Center. Since they pay for it, they get
to use it. However, staff and faculty do not pay fees, so they do not get
to use the Fitness Center unless they fork over the $135.
Realistically, $135 per year is a great deal because 1 don't think
you'll find a health club in the area that offers a similar price. But
that’s not the point. Faculty and staff members, while they are paid for
what they do, keep this university running. It’s kind of a slap in the
face to know that you put in 40 hours a week in some cases but can’t
even run around the indoor track.
And how many students pay their fees and never use the Fitness
Center? I’m sure the university is not going to go broke if staff and
faculty members are allowed to use the facility.
Maybe we should look at the things staff and faculty members do
for students and the university.
Faculty members obviously teach us, but they do more than that
in most cases. They impart personal knowledge to us that will help us

in the real world. Anyone can read to students out of a textbook and
grade papers all day. Our faculty members bring their experience and
expertise to students. They could just as easily take their knowledge
elsewhere.
The staff members do things most students might not even think
about. We might take for granted that when we throw something
away, the trash can is not overflowing. We might not think about the
people who handle the lines at the Bursar’s Office and give student
workers paychecks. We probably don’t give a second thought to the
people who cut the grass and pick up trash around the campus. My
point is, there are a lot of staff members contributing to our campus
and our benefit.
It seems pretty ironic to me that we can have someone sweep the
gym floor in the Fitness Center, but he can’t even pick up a basketball
and shoot a few hoops during his time off.
Another thing that I don't understand is why faculty and staff
members got their line at the Bursar’s Office taken away. Now they
are forced to stand in line with students.
At first reaction, I might think that maybe they should have to
stand in the same line I stand in. But I realize that faculty and staff
members are on much tighter schedules than I am.
I have two classes every day. Many faculty members teach
several classes, serve office hours and have meetings to attend. Staff
members work 40-hour weeks.
The staff and faculty line gave these people a chance to do their
business and get back to work as quickly as possible. As far as I know,
I ha%'e never heard a student complain about the special line.
As I said in the beginning, I appreciate our faculty and staff and
I believe they should have some perks with their jobs.
Maybe 1 am alone with my opinion. If so, then I ask someone to
enlighten me.

Absent students may be asked to pay up

D a ily M iss iss ipp ia n

OXFORD, Miss. (U-WIRE) - Students
who stopped attending classes last semester
and receive federal financial aid may be asked
to repay the money.
A new interpretation of the federal aid
requires universities to prove that students
who receive the aid are in fact attending class.
This requirement has left many universities
with a problem since professors and
instructors are not required to take
attendance.
The University of Mississippi has begun
a process of going through a list of all
students who receive federal financial aid
then looking to see if they had a passing grade
in any class. Students who earned either an F
or an incomplete must then be checked by
their instructors to determine the last day they
attended class. Teachers who do not keep roll
must use assignments or final exams to prove

that the student has not “unofficially
withdrawn.”
Director of Financial Aid Larry
Ridgeway said roughly 100 students might
have to repay money. Financial aid is
distributed through, the university at the
beginning of the semester, and students who
are not going to class will be asked to pay it
back, Ridgeway said.
The university is subject to audit for all
federal aid. A student must have “unofficially
withdrawn” from all of his classes before they
will be asked to pay money back. As long as
one professor or instructor can prove that a
student attended class or took the final exam
he meets the requirements.
The provost’s office has asked the deans
to address the matter with their faculty and
develop a way to handle the problems this
year and prevent it in the future. “It’s going to
mean having our faculty and instructors do a
better job of keeping track of when students

are attending,” Associate Provost Maurice
Eftink said.
Dean of Liberal Arts Glenn Hopkins said
the matter was discussed with the department
chairs at their regular curriculum and policy
meeting, but no other steps have been made.'
He said the departments which have large
classes are looking into ways keeping better
roll. “I’m hoping there won’t be any
problems. We will monitor the progress and
see if it meets the university’s requirements,”
Hopkins said.
Mississippi State University is using the
same process to solve its problem. Bruce
Crane, director of financial aid, said about 60
of approximately 16,000 students are affected
there.
“Relatively few students are impacted,
but if you are one of them it is a huge deal,”
he said. “The message the feds are trying to
deliver is that students have an obligation and
they must live up to that obligation.”

EDUCATION —

from page 1
“Of particular concern is the
quality of education provided in
high-need, urban school districts
where teacher shortages often
force districts to hire less than
fully qualified teachers,” Polite
said.
The funding will be used to
create a program that will prepare
and develop teachers for this
setting.
SIUE has had a similar
arrangement with Alton schools
since 1998. Last fall the School
of Education began similar
programs in Belleville and
Cahokia. These programs have
been modeled after the popular
Professional
Development
Schools, which are becoming a
part of university education

training across the country. The
SIUE programs have been
dubbed “Building Bridges for
Success.” They represent a
change in how teachers and
school administrators are
prepared.
The East St. Louis program
will provide the same kinds of
training for SIUE students as the
Alton, Belleville and Cahokia
programs. The program is
designed to attract and train new
teachers, provide support for new
teachers and enhance the skills of
existing teachers.
“These programs also
provide a training model for our
students and a valuable learning
experience for district students,”
Polite said.

BROWNE--------

from page 1
“It was moving to see the
importance people placed on
their vote,” Browne said.
Although the political
atmosphere was tense, Browne
said he never felt that he or the
other members of the group were
in any real danger. The only
potential danger he saw was
being in a crowd when a situation
erupted.
“I’m on very good terms and
I’ve known all of these guys for
30 years,” he said. “I know the
opposition guys and I also know
the guys in power so I don’t think
we were ever in any danger.”
Browne worked witfr these
leaders on several projects such
as the construction of new roads

on the island of Zanzibar. His
knowledge of the people and the
area is part of the reason for his
appointment to the election
monitor position.
In the end, the delegation did
not certify the election as both
free and fair due to evidence of
fraud in 16 constituencies, but
Browne said the election was
successful because there was no
violence surrounding the
outcome.
“The important thing to
remember is that the group in
power retained power peacefully,
and this sends a very positive and
hopeful message about the future
of the country’s political
stability,” he said.

The average person burps and farts 15
times a day.
As disgusting as this fact may be, it is
only a small portion of
what the St. Louis
Science Center has to Tta no$e
offer in the new exhibit
appropriately called
Grossology, which runs snot everj 20
until May 8.
Grossology: The
(Impolite) Science of the Human Body
presents visitors with the good, the bad
and the sickening truths of bodily

functions. Facts, interactive games and
larger-than-life replicas allow guests to
learn in an unusual but entertaining way.
Runny noses, body odor and digestion are
topics of focus. All processes of the human
body are seen and sometimes smelled.
The tour of
exhibition starts
a new latch o£ with the gallery
entrance where
“Her Grossness,”
n w te j.
an
animated
character, knows
all about the gross
subjects including the nose. Y U Stink is
an interactive game where one matches the
odors with the area of the body they come
from including armpits and
feet. The Tour du Nose is an
oversized duplication where
visitors may walk through and
view the inside nasal features
such as nose hair. A game
called Up*4Your Nose shows
how snot forms by launching
pollen balls at a gigantic nose.
If too many pollen balls enter,
the nose sneezes them back at
the person. The games get
better as the bodily functions
get more grotesque.
Perhaps the best
interactive guide is Urine: the
Game. This virtual reality
simulator places an individual
inside the stomach where one
decides what is and isn’t good
for the body. Participants are
given a trigger device to sort
through types of waste that

I’ll let you in on a little secret.
I have found, hands down, the best way to study for finals. That’s
right, the commuter reveals his secrets.
The first thing you have to do is know somebody, preferably a
good friend, who has gone away to school to some place like, let’s say
Millikin University in Decatur. It could be any school of course, but
for our purposes it will be Millikin.
The weekend before finals you call that person and politely invite
yourself for a visit. Now this might take some doing if the person’s
finals are next week as yours, but if the person is anything like my
friend, you won’t have a problem.
If you’re smart, you’ll take someone with you who can ask you
study questions on the two-hour drive there. But if you can make the
trip in 90 minutes or so, then you don’t need to worry about those
study questions.
When you get there, you party.
Sounds simple enough, but the trick here is not to party too hard.
You don’t want to be puking everything you’ve eaten in the last six
years all over your friend’s bathroom. If you get a little hungover,
that’s cool because you still have the morning and the drive home to
clear your head. All the distractions are gone and you can cram for the
exams.
Now being a commuter and still living at home, I had to convince
my parents to let me go. I mean, come on. It’s the weekend before
finals. Are you crazy? Do you really want to screw up your grades?
Well of course not. Might be crazy, but I don’t want to mess with
my grades.
To sell this to those in charge, only stay one night. That’s right.
Pick a night, any night, and relax and have a good time in preparation
for those nasty exams.
Now the intellects out there will dispute this method of studying
six ways from Sunday, but do you know what I say to them? I say
phooey. Go ahead, say it. Phooey.
OK, so maybe not phooey.
But life is passing them by. You only live once and you’re only a
teen-ager once. You’re supposed to do crazy things and barely get out
alive, right? At least you’re supposed to do crazy in moderation.
So, follow the previously mentioned guidelines and go to class,
take good notes, read your assignments and do your homework. Do
these things and you are guaranteed a good grade on finals.
That’s funny. Homework, assignments, classes, notes. Could that
be why?
Nah.

Lady Cougars start GLVC run with Quincy

Sarah Larson is currently averaging 6 .7 points p e r g am e and 4.1
rebounds p e r gam e.

Getting above .500 in
conference is all that’s on the
minds of the Lady Cougars these
days.
SIUE is on a two-game
winning streak with wins against
the University of Indianapolis
and the University of IllinoisSpringfield, and will look to
improve its streak on Saturday.
“Going into a tough
conference schedule, it is very
important to start getting back on
track,” head coach Wendy
Hedberg said.
The Lady Cougars will
travel to Quincy to try to shoot
down the high flying Lady
Hawks of Quincy University.
The Lady Hawks are tied for
fourth place in the Great Lakes
Valley Conference with a record
of 3-2 and a 7-4 record overall
and will be swooping down with
a four-game winning streak when
they meet the Lady Cougars on
Saturday.
This is a major improvement
from the 2-18 record the Lady
Hawks produced last year,
placing them at the bottom of the
GLVC and finishing the 1999-

2000 season with a dismal 6-20
overallrecord.
Quincy will be led by senior
center Colleen Sexton, who is
averaging 14.2 points per game
this year. She leads a team of
Lady Hawks that has two other
players averaging in double digit scoring, and a total of six
players averaging more than five
points per game.
Sexton also leads the team in
rebounds, averaging just more
than five per game. She was
named GLVC Player of the Week
earlier this year.
Although the game is played
in Quincy, the advantage may not
go to the home team.
The Lady Hawks hold a .500
record at home and have
managed to produce a more
successful record on the road
going 3-1.
The Lady Cougars will only

go as far as point guard Misi
Clark will take them.
Clark, the leading scorer in
SIUE history, has started her
senior campaign. She leads the
team in scoring eight out of the
11 games played this year,
averaging just under 19 points.
Clark also leads the team in
rebounds with six per game.
“Misi has just been taking
over,” Hedberg said. “She is a
creator. She cuts, she slashes,
anything it takes to get into
scoring position.”
Perhaps Hedberg’s crew will
be able begin the game against
the Lady Hawks better than it has
in recent matchups.
The Lady Cougars have been
less productive at the start of their
games, scoring 100 points fewer
in the first half than the second.

The SIUE men’s ice hockey
team is looking to build on its
recent win and improve its I-7-1
record this weekend.
“We started the season out
kind of slow, but with the youth
it’s understandable because a lot
of the guys had only played high
school hockey,” captain Scott
Cloin said. “I think we’re starting
to come on now. We’re starting to
click.”
The Cougars won their first
game 4-3 against Washington
University in December. Cloin
scored three goals for the hat
trick and Nick Gedris had three
assists in the game.
David Svezia had the team’s
other goal, and goalie Todd
Bartoszkiewicz recorded the win
over the Bears. The line of Mike
Cusack, Gedris and Cloin were
on the ice for all of SIUE’s goals.

Cloin is leading the team
with nine points, a combination
of eight goals and one assist.
Gedris is second with two goals
and six assists for a total of eight
points.
The team’s recent success
can be attributed to the
performance of many of the
freshmen. Brad Maggio is one of
the leading freshmen this season
with five points.
“Our biggest strength has to
be our youth because only about
seven guys returned from last
season, so we had 20 others
coming together at the same time.
We’ve had a lot of time to grow
as a team,” Cloin said.
The Cougars’ last game was
Jan. 6 when they took on the
University of Missouri-St. Louis
Rivermen. The Rivermen (16-11) won the game 4-1.
Maggio scored SIUE’s only
goal on a power play. Ty Suhre

and Joe Schmitt assisted on
Maggio’s goal. UMSL’s fourth
goal was scored after SIUE had
pulled its goalie.
“The game Saturday was one
of the best games we’ve played
all season,” Cloin said. “UMSL
normally destroys teams on the
scoreboard and on the ice, and we
kept it close.”
SIUE’s next game is on the
road against the Eastern Illinois
University Panthers this at what
time?. Saturday in Charleston.
The Panthers haven’t played
a game since Dec. 2 when they
faced Wash U. They led 2-0 in the
first period and scored two quick
goals in the first five minutes of
the third to clinch the win 4-3.
SIUE’s next home game will
be at 3 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 20,
against Northern Illinois
University of De Kalb at East
Alton Ice Arena.

SIUE golf coach has worn many hats
C a r r ie C a r d u c c i

Head women’s golf
coach, assistant director of
campus recreation and
former state director for
the National-Intramural
Recreational
Sport
Association are just a few
positions Larry Bennett
has held.
Bennett is the
founding coach of the
Bennett
SIUE women’s golf team.
The team is only three years old and already has
enjoyed success. This year’s team had only one
golfer return from last year’s squad, but it still
managed to hold it’s own against it’s Great Lakes
Valley Conference rivals and set a few school
records.
Bennett is an alumnus of SIUE. He has worked

with Campus Recreation ever since 1988, holding
various positions such as coordinator of Campus
Recreation and assistant to the director of Campus
Recreation.
Bennett works with a staff of more than 80
people in the administration of SIUE’s200,000
square foot indoor recreation facility. He also
oversees SIUE’s outdoor recreation facility, which
includes the 200 acre Cougar Lake.
Bennett also has many duties away from the
SIUE campus. Bennett formerly served as director
for the National-Intramural Recreation Sport
Association. Bennett was a regional site committee
member for the 1994 United States Olympic
Festival.
He is involved in his community. He is the
commissioner and finance committee chairman for
the Collinsville Area Recreation District. Even with
all these leadership roles, Bennett still manages to
give his golfers the attention they need for a
successful season.

“We can’t afford to start the
game off down by 12 or 13 points
like we have lately,” Hedberg
said. “It makes it difficult to get
back in the game.”
Last season the Lady
Cougars met the Lady Hawks in a
conference battle and won 67-60
en route to a fourth-place finish
in the GLVC.
Early in the year, the Lady
Cougars have outrebounded their
opponents by a wide margin, but

lately rebounding is just one of
the concerns Hedberg has for her
Lady Cougars.
“Lately I’ve been concerned
with our overall performance,”
Hedberg said. “We need to
rebound better and try to control
the pace of the game on both
sides of play.”
Hedberg thinks if the Lady
Cougars work on these key
elements, they should be in
contention.
