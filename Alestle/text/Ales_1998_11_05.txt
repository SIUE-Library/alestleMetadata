SIUE first in nation to utilize Job Finder software
ALESTLE STAFF REPORT
SIUE’s job referral service is
going online and is the first
school in the nation to use a new
software program to match
students and employers.
The bulletin boards outside

the employment office on the
second floor of the Rendleman
Building will be taken down next
week when the service becomes
part of SIUE’s web pages.
The system took about a year
to develop in cooperation with a

Texas softw are m anufacturer,
according to M arian Smithson,
director of financial aid.
Academic Software Inc. provides
software to universities and
schools across the country.
Sm ithson said the company
supplied the program used by the

SIUE
Career
D evelopm ent
Center and is already looking to
market the job referral software
to other schools.
“This
will
create
the
mechanism to link the students
with the employers,” she said.
At any time there may be as

many as 700 jobs posted on
Student Job Finder, according to
Sally Mullen, assistant financial
aid director. Smithson noted there
were more than 1,000 jobs posted
at the beginning o f this school
year.

No velvet Elvis here: Art Auction on tap UC to get computer lab
BY QIANA RANDALL
NEWS STRINGER

BY TRAVIS KNUCKOLLS
NEWS STRINGER
Friday is the final day to
turn in entries for the 1998 Art
Auction. The Art Auction is an
annual event sponsored by
SIUE Friends of Art and the
Department of Art and Design.
It is an opportunity to have your
artwork sold in a professional
venue and gives the work
exposure in the art community.
For more than 20 years the
Art Auction has been raising
money for the Department of
Art and Design. Last year the
auction raised $14,000 after
expenses.
Entries of every kind are
w elcom e and everyone is
invited to donate their work
provided that it is properly
m atted
or
mounted.
Professionals and am ateurs
alike are eligible to donate art.
Art entered into the auction
by students will be judged.
A prize of $300 will go to
the best of show. A prize of
$200 will go to first place and a
prize of $100 will be given to
the second-place entry.

with student Amber Hevermann, left, during the recent
promotional brunch for the Art Auction.
According
to
Dianne
Lynch, the office supervisor of
the art department and treasurer
o f the Friends o f Art, 275
people registered for the auction
last year. However, many more
went unaccounted for as it
was not a requirem ent to
register. Generally, there are
between 225 and 275 pieces
donated and all are sold
before the night is over.

This year the auction will
be at the Sunset Hills Country
Club in Edwardsville. The price
of admission is $2. The event
begins with a preview o f the
auction at 6:30 p.m. and the
actual auction begins at 7 p.m.
on Nov. 19. The Gary Niemeier
Auction Service will provide
auctioneer services. Everyone is
invited to attend even if you do
not plan on bidding.

Preservation Hall Jazz Band will perform
Sunday as part of Arts & Issues series
BY TAMARA KANO
NEWS STRINGER
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band from New O rleans will
perform Sunday, Nov. 8, at 4 p.m.
in the Meridian Ballroom of the
Morris University Center. The
event is part of SIU E’s Art &
Issues Series and is co-sponsored
by W SIE-FM (88.7) and The
Bank of Edwardsville.
Richard Walker, coordinator
of Arts & Issues, said that the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band was

on campus in 1976 during the
Mississippi River Festival and
SIUE wanted to bring them back
23 years later.
“They are a world-class band
that plays a down-to-earth jazz
program,” Walker said. “It’s like
having
Mardi
Gras
in
November.”
The band has been playing
the traditional New Orleans
sound for more than 50 years and
consists of seven members. The
oldest m em ber is 89 years
old and the youngest is just

out of college.
W alker said that they are
expecting around 900 people to
attend the event.
“We are probably going to
sell out and I don’t think we will
have tickets at the door,” he said.
Tickets are sold out for this
concert. However, A rts and
Issues tickets can alw ays be
purchased at the Union Station.
Students with a valid ID receive
a discount. Admission includes
free parking in Lot B behind the
Morris University Center.

Due to popular demand, a
computer lab is being installed in
the M orris U niversity Center
because of the convenient
location.
The computer lab will be
located in the old TV Room.
“Student Government is very
supportive and w illing to
relocate,” said Mary Robinson,
director of the Morris University
Center.
A total of 19 computers are
expected to be installed in the

computer lab. Robinson intends
for students to be able to access
the Internet and word processing
program s. Printers will be
available in the lab. Robinson is
not sure if there will be a fee to
print. The computer lab will be
open during regular University
Center hours.
Part of the funding for the
computer lab will come from the
Academic Computing Counsel.
Computers will be installed in
phases.
“Dates of completion are not
available at this time, but the
project will be started as soon as
possible,” Robinson said.

Watch out for that deer
BY DAMEENA COX
NEWS STRINGER
Oh, deer! It’s mating season
and they’re coming out to play.
Love can turn to tragedy so
quickly. Fortunately, there are
precautions motorists can take to
reduce the chances of turning
deer into mere road kill.
Deer can be seen running
across the road at any time, but

I I

F -J ii

the early morning hours, around
dawn, is when drivers should be
especially alert. Reducing speed
and maintaining control of the
vehicle can help avoid deer that
have run onto the road.
The Illinois Department of
Conservation reports that the
average cost of each accident
involving a deer is approximately
$3,000.

G uest colum n

Fight for your right to be visible
I am invisible. That is, I am
never where I am, where
everybody else is, because
nobody ever sees m e there.
Perhaps you are invisible also.
Did you ever get to erase the
blackboard in grade school? Were
you never picked in grade
school? Were you never picked
for a choose-up-sides game at
recess? Were you left standing
there with your socks creeping
under your heels?
W hen the football stars
surfed for a date to the prom, did
their eyes (pass over) you as you
fumbled at your locker with your
sweater misbuttoned? ...
If you answered yes to the
above questions, stern measures
must be taken. And if you still
have doubts, pause to wonder

why bank tellers slam their
window closed when your turn
comes, or store clerks take their
breaks when you approach their
register.
Your first defense is to move
out of that last desk in the back
row during classes. Do this
gradually to avoid trauma.
Your second ploy is to talk.
D on’t be hesitant. Talk to
everybody. It doesn’t matter what
you say because nobody is
listening anyway and it gives you
valuable experience.
Stop seething when the
female driver in her small, purple
car sends you leaping for the curb
at the crossw alk. W ait for a
crowd. She won’t hit all of you.
Also, carry a striped golf
umbrella. It makes a statement.

Remember that the Internal
Revenue Service can find you
and telem arketers know your
telephone number.
I
have
organized
a
m ovem ent, and our cause is
gaining m om entum . We have
signs and placards. We intend to
march in protest. The problem is
that no one will see us as we
charge down Main Street and we
may get run over by a city bus.
At any rate, in my next life I
hope to come back as a 1,000pound black bear. It should get
their attention.

L etter to the E ditor
Tired o f negative letters
I for one am so tired of
reading this newspaper’s editorial
column. I mean, what’s the point
when the only editorials being
written are negative reviews of
the newspaper itself? So many
people
complain
that
all
Danielle’s editorials are about the
black experience. She’s a black
woman. You want she should
write about the struggles of gay
Polish taxi drivers?
You want to read about
problem s
in
the
white

experience? Why doesn’t a white
person write about it? Certainly
some of them m ust have
opinions, and yet the only
editorials this paper gets are
related to how the ed ito r’s
editorials aren’t all PC and
racially neutral enough.
Not every editorial can be
Pulitzer Prize-winning material.
Not every writer can write from
the point of view of any person
and have it be heartfelt and
authentic. Danielle does a great
job for what she’s doing. Now

let’s see some of you readers do
better.
That is, besides the prude
who wrote in because he had a
problem with a naked depiction
of Jesus hanging in the Opapi
Lounge.
H owever,
W estern
society’s deathly fear of the
naked form and human sexuality
is another editorial that’s dying to
be written.

Leaving activism to the Beaver
SIUE is the June and Ward Cleaver School of
Activism.
Nothing seems to start a fire under people around
here. Maybe this is Utopia. Maybe no one cares. Either
way, activism seems dormant on this campus.
We live in an age where almost everyone is mad
Danielle
about
something.
Everyone has something that will push
Belton
a hot button. It may be human rights or democracy.
Maybe the word “censorship” sends chills up the spine. Certainly
abortion has sparked a few heated debates. But here we seem to have
noncommittal complacency.
Can’t do anything about it. Why try?
No one wants fanaticism, but why should we settle for apathy
and cynicism? Many students are angry about parking tickets. They
rant and rave and fume, but do they ever do anything? W hether it’s
a perceived injustice or just a slight, students here merely react with
cynical detachment. After rattling off a string of expletives, they
shrug their shoulders in apathy and walk away.
Student workers complain that they are often treated as if they
don’t have 15 hours o f classes to worry about. People are hired and
fired constantly. But do students care about their fellow student
workers? Most of the time, it’s other students who are giving the
workers a hard time. Who cares if a few people feel like they aren’t
being treated justly? Those people aren’t you. That’s their problem.
That is, until you become a student worker.
We have political and social organizations that are practically
silent when it comes to real issues on campus. Civil rights all over
the world are being threaten, and w e’re just sort of flowing in and
out with the tide. While we’re sitting around waning and waxing
with the moon, millions of others are finding causes to believe in and
dreams to stand up for.
What would it take to get students angry on this campus?
Perhaps the university could install pay toilets. Would the strain on
our pocketbooks and, perhaps, our bowels cause us to get mad
enough to protest?
Since I’ve been here, the biggest stink I’ve ever seen on campus
was over the late-night dance policy last semester. Dance organizers
were highly upset with the idea that students could only bring one
guest. That would mean less revenue for Greek organizations that
participated in these late-night dances. Greek leaders lobbied the
Alestle for coverage; they screamed to everyone they knew. But
what about larger, more substantive issues? What about a bad
professor who has tenure yet fails to help students learn? What about
graduate assistants who are not qualified to teach classes? What
about poor lab facilities or a lack of equipment? What about concern
for other people and injustices elsewhere? If people here can be
upset about party time, shouldn’t they get upset about larger issues?
And if you can’t hate something enough to do something about
it, can you love something enough to get others to care? Maybe
some student organizations want to get together and put on an affair
that would promote understanding, love and unity on our campus —
a festival that would transcend race, gender, age, culture and Greek
affiliation. Can students here care enough about the bike paths to
make sure they get repaved on the 400 side of Cougar Village? Can
we care enough about diversity to ensure that everyone, not just the
international students, will celebrate International Week. Maybe we
could form politically and culturally conscious organizations that
could promote free thinking and enlightenment and then, maybe
then, find something to love enough to get passionate about.
Either way, let's start showing some emotion. A little passion
might give our campus a personality that’s a more colorful and a
little less ’50s-TV black-and-white.

MARILYN MANSO« STOCKS T»E CROWD AT TffE F o x
BY JANEE PRIDGEN
LIFHSTYI.E STRINGER
Thousands o f concertgoers fastened their safety
belts and geared up for the roller coaster of their lives.
On the evening o f Tuesday, October 27, Marilyn
Manson made his second appearance at the Fox
Theatre in St. Louis.
A sea of bodies dressed mostly in black and
handfuls of painted goth faces filled the seats of
the prestigious concert hall as the anticipation
grew unbearable. O utside, religious groups
dem onstrated by carrying signs boycotting
Marilyn M anson’s scheduled performance.
Shortly after 7:30 p.m., 12 Rounds, a British
goth group newly signed to nothing Records,
entered the stage to play a nine-song, 50-minute
set. Fronted by Claudia Sarne, whose voice has
been described as a cross between Cruella De Vil
and Eartha Kitt. this gothic group slithered their
way onto the crowd. A dark mood lingered which
appeared to be too gloomy or too boring for most
of the charged M arilyn Manson fans. The music
was as mysterious as the vocals. One devoted
Manson fan stated, “They *v J more metal. It's
too calm in here. Othe. aan that, I love her
tights.” At time nie sign language interpreter
received more attention.
During the set change. Pink Floyd’s “The
Wall” played overhead. After what seemed like an
eternity to some and only 20 minutes to others, the
overhead lights began to dim. The blue lights behind the
silk screen covering the stage revealed the silhouette of
one of the most controversial groups in the world.
With peaking excitement, the crowd stood up, its
energy flying through the roof. Thunderous rhythms
radiated into the souls o f these eager fans. The sound

crew removed the screen, exposing the four members
producing the background music. M ulticolored
speakers, blocks and TV screens covered the stage and
added life and glamor to the set.
Smoke filled the area as Manson appeared before

controversy begin.
“The Reflecting God,” first of the 16-song set,
surprised many as an opener to the M echanical Animals
tour, especially since the song is from their previous
album, “Antichrist Superstar.” Lights and stage effects
complemented the next few songs, including selections
from another previous album and the newest one.
The bright lights and costumes revealed a
more glam-rock Hollywood style, more Marilyn
than Manson. Costume changes occured as often
as the number of times Manson spat into the
crowd, which is to say very often.
Armored up in his red platforms and sequined
one-sleeve bodysuit (with another matching
thong), he sang “Rock is Dead” and left many
seeing red sparkles and feathers.
Halfway into the set, two gospel singers
entered the stage to sing backup vocals. This
surprising new twist left many M anson f; :is
shocked and confused. “I think it’s cool that
they're changing and all, but I’m not quite sure
everyone’s going to like it,” Sarah Park, a Manson
fan since early 1994, commented. “Although I
think only Manson could pull it off.”
Others seemed indifferent to the change with
comments like “Hey. it’s still M anson,” and “I
love them either way. Change is good. It keeps us
on our toes.”
The drug addict anthem “I D on’t Like the
Drugs, but the Drugs Like Me” was accompanied by a
Vegas-style sign that read “Drugs” which lit up very
brightly whenever the word “drugs” was spoken,
adding a dose of humor.

a cape and thong to patch up those exposed areas. His
hairspray-stiff, red-streaked black hair warped everyone
back to the ’80s.
Oh, and what would the band be without their
makeup? Omega and his Mechanical Animals were
dolled up with their finest faces. M anson’s cape fell to
the floor and everything was in full effect. Let the

Alii Khat is not a licensed therapist
and her advice should only be taken seriously if
you are very desperate, or make numerous
phone calls to psychic hot lines.
Dear Alii Khat,
Last weekend, my friends and I were really bored. We all decided
to go to the computer lab for lack of something better to do. We were there
chatting for about two hours. Now all my friends want to do is hang out in the
computer lab and chat. I’m starting to get lonely. — Non-chatter Charlie

Dear Non-chatter Charlie,
It’s a shame that your friends have chosen the computers over
you. It’s amazing to me how computers have gone from being a device
used to type term papers to an opponent in chess and card games, a best friend and, sad to say, a
sexual partner for some. What is this world coming to? Soon people won’t even have to leave their
homes because the computers will be sufficient for every human need.

Nostradamus predicted a world
revolution in 1999 and the rise of a
new world leader for the next
millenium. Who will it be?
“Ross Perot.”
-Eduardo Poeliniz,
Junior, pre-med

Dear Alii Khat,
This guy has been bugging me to do something with him for about three months now. I
have always told him no because I am not interested in him or the activity he wants to drag me to.
Well it just so happens that there is this really cool ska band playing in two weeks, and I really
want to go. If he asks me, should I say yes, and how can I make him understand that I don’t want a
relationship with him? — Need Advice Angie

Dear Need Advice Angie,
I’m gathering from your letter that you are basically going to use this guy to take you to
the ska show, get his hopes up and then watch his ego crash to the ground when you w on’t go out
with him again. Cool!
Guys are usually the ones who are being jerks, and this is your opportunity to get back at
the male species for all the times they have said they would call but they didn't, led you to believe
they loved you but really only wanted sex and so on.
You could really have fun with this one. Wear a short skirt and a tight top (low-cut, of
course) and flirt with him all night. Then when it’s time to go home, go home with another guy.

MANSON,

from page 4

The really controversial
stuff began in the second half
of the show. To start off,
Manson taunted the security
guards, one in particular,
during “User Friendly,” a song
about how one uses another for
their own gratification without
being in love.
Soon after that, Manson
paused to ask why there were
sign language interpreters at
his concert. “Are there any
deaf people here? I didn’t think
you could f***ing hear me.”
He then incited the audience to
spit on the interpreters.
In another inevitable
instance midway through the
song “Antichrist Superstar,”
Manson, dressed in a black suit
and red shirt, ripped up a Bible
and tossed the torn pages into
the audience.
During
“Irresponsible
Hate
A nthem ,”
M ansoa
provoked fans to raise their
hands in rage and display only
their middle fingers —
som ething
everyone
was
taught not to do during their
adolescent years.
Manson played "Rock 'n '
Roll Nigger,” a remake of the
Patti Smith song. His cover of
it, forever being mistakenly
perceived as racist, was
banned during the group’s
Dead to the World tour.
M anson jum ped aboard
his infam ous stilts for one
song, then continued to sing
crowdpleasers from the last
tour for the encore.
In all, the unleashing of
anger was well worth $25 and
hours in ticket lines.

“ V a n p ir e s ”
m akes a k illin g
o v e r H a llo w e e n
N EW Y O R K (A P) — W hen Hollywood trots out
vampires, the results are visually enjoyable but usually
predictable: oral fixations, elaborate graveyard scenes, nubile
women dancing the line between allure and decay. Only
occasionally do cinematic chronicles of the undead rise above.
“John C arpenter’s Vampires,” an exceptionally bloody
entry in the canon of Nosferatu, does. It’s not just mediocre
schlock. It’s well-executed, engrossing, innovative ... schlock.
Carpenter, of course, knows how to do horror. From the
original “Halloween” to his unsettling remake of “The Thing,”
he can push view ers’ buttons like no other. But with
“Vampires,” he goes another dimension further. Visually, it’s
just stunning. In New Mexico, where the skies seem a deeper
blue and the earth a bloodier red, vampire slayer Jim Crow
(James Woods) leads a high-tech team scouring the parched
Southwest looking for nests of the undead. Crow is a callous,
often cruel man with a troubled, tragic childhood who does the
Roman Catholic Church’s dirty work of eliminating the unholy.
Blood, to be sure, is a staple of vampire movies. Carpenter
applies it to excess, but he uses a few early scenes to establish
the almost-cartoonish quality of his violence. So by the time a
priest is decapitated and a group of monks are set upon by a
pack of vampires, the gore, for better or worse, has been folded
into the story.
Carpenter has always done well with that balancing act and
here he has clearly perfected it; this is one of his most violent
films to date, yet the violence doesn’t overshadow the story.
What makes “Vampires” special is its look, rendered
lovingly by production designer Thomas A. W alsh and
cinem atographer Gary B. Kibbe. They use southw estern
Spanish architecture to evoke gothic and Old West flavors,
subtly linking the New Mexico landscape to the Old World
stomping ground o f cinema’s traditional vampires. Adept uses
o f light, shadow and sunset round out the appearance for a
sensory treat.
“John C arpenter’s Vampires” is produced by Sandy King
from a Don Jakoby screenplay.
