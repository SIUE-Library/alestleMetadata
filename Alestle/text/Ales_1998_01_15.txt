“Where Are YOU Going to Live Next Year?” This is the theme for
the housing reservation process for the 1998 - 1999 academic year.
The process will begin Jan. 20.
Next year housing is offering a variety of choices and
affordability to residents of University Housing.
“We are going to try our best to accommodate as many people as
possible,” Floyd Welsh, associate director of housing said.
Welsh said that due to renovations that will take place at Cougar
Village Apartments spaces are going to be limited. However, these
renovations are not a bad thing. Due to these renovations, the
construction of Prairie Hall and a new educational environment at
Woodland Residence Hall, residents will have more to choose from.
Students who choose to reside in Cougar Village Apartments will
have two options. The options will include first class or economy
apartments.

As students walked into the
enrollment office on Monday
they were met with change.
Instead of having to wait in long
lines, students were able access
their schedules through the
CougarNet service.
“On Monday, CougarNet
received a total of 3,676
inquiries,” Marian Smithson,
director of financial aid said.
Smithson came up with the

idea for CougarNet after seeing
a similar student access service
in a student service center at the
University
of
Delaware.
Carbondale also has a similar
service.
The CougarNet is SlUE’s
own Internet service. It allows
students to review copies of
class schedules and unofficial
transcripts. In some areas, such
as the enrollment office,
students are able to print
documents out.

If courses like physics and
calculus are taxing for some
people, a certain office is offering
students
and
the
public
something different.

The Office of Continuing
Education at SIUE is offering
several non-credit courses for
spring semester.
Many people would never
think of taking a non-credit
course. However, these courses
have a lot to offer. Coordinator of
Non-Credit Activities Emily
Coffin, said that non-credit
courses have duel purposes. They
offer leisure activities and allow
people who do not attend the

university to see the campus and
use its facilities. They also offer
self-satisfaction through classes
that emphasize the body and
mind.
“It allows people in the
community to do something they
enjoy at minimal expense, close
to home,” Coffin said.
This spring, courses are
being
offered
in
music
instruction, improvement of mind
and body, computer instruction

and dance.
“Ballroom
dancing
is
making a comeback,” Coffin
said.
Coffin mentioned that many
family’s and older individuals
attend the ballroom dancing
classes.
Engaged
couples
interested in learning dance
techniques also enjoy these
classes.
Coffin also said that a lot of
traditional age students take

classes such as Kung Fu for selfdefense.
Classes such as Hatha Yoga
and T’ai Chi Ch’uan offer a
chance for students to improve
both their minds and muscles.
Most of this spring’s non­
credit courses begin in late
January and end in March or
April. For more information call

of Continuing
Education at 692-3210.

St. Louis Institute for the deaf gets $10 million
anonymous donation towards renovation of center
ST. LOUIS (AP) — The
Central Institute for the Deaf has
received a big head start toward its
goal of raising $25 million for an
expansion and renovation.
An anonymous donor gave
the institute a $10 million
challenge gift, institute officials
said Tuesday. To claim the gift, the
institute must raise the remaining
$15 million over the next
five years.
“This absolutely amazing
initial gift and significant

participation from other donors
will ensure the long-term future
and vitality of the Central Institute
for the Deaf,” said Robert C.
Clark, president of the institute’s
board of managers.
Institute officials say they
believe that the gift — from an
out-of- town donor— is one of the
largest ever given to a nonprofit
organization in St. Louis.
“We are all eager to meet the
terms of the challenge grant,”

Clark said. “We know that our
impact on the quality of life for
hearing-impaired children and
adults will be tremendous.”
The renovation plans include
updating the 84-year-old institute’s
four-story main building that
overlooks Interstate 64 in central
St. Louis; and building a new
research
center
near
the
main building.
In the years ahead, the
institute also wants to add a

gymnasium and a round building
that would house a cafeteria,
library, auditorium and offices.
Executive director Donald
Nielsen said the institute plans to
begin renovating the main
building a year from now and
finish by 2000. During the
renovation, he said, students will
attend classes in the institute’s
dormitory building.
The institute wants to start
w»rk on the new research building

in the summer of 2000 and finish it
in 2001.
The institute has about 70
students enrolled this term. It is
one of only four private schools in
the country that teach deaf
children how to talk. Officials say
it is the only institution in the
world combining oral education
for deaf children, scientific
research, clinical services and
graduate
education
in
all
three areas.

Study shows passive smoking can hasten hardening of the arteries
CHICAGO (AP) —
Cigarette
smoking
and
exposure to secondhand smoke
both
significantly
hasten
hardening of the arteries, and the
damage may be permanent, a
new study suggests.
An estimated 30,000 to
60,000 annual deaths in the
United States can be attributed to
secondhand smoking, wrote the
authors, led by epidemiologist
George Howard at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina.
Their study appears in

Wednesday’s issue of The
Journal of the American Medical
Association.
Previous studies have shown
that secondhand smoke, like
active smoking, can kill by
causing more acute but reversible
problems, such as thickening of
the blood.
The
American
Heart
Association, which advocates
banning smoking in all public
places, said this was the first
study to link passive smoking
with narrowing in the carotid
arteries, which carry blood to the

brain. Carotid-artery narrowing
“indicates that other blood
vessels are similarly affected,
including ones in the heart
muscle,” the association said in a
news release.
Dr. Stanton A. Glantz, a
secondhand smoke expert at the
University of California-San
Francisco, said the study
“provides a real important
bridge” between studies that
have found that cigarette smoke
causes deteriorating arteries and
studies showing that passive
smokers have an increased risk

of fatal heart attacks.
“This fills in that missing
link,” Glantz said.
Tom Lauria, a spokesman
for The Tobacco Institute, which
is funded by the tobacco industry,
said advocates there had not yet
evaluated the study. But he
noted: “The majority of studies
do not show any increased risk
for non-smokers. We consider
the science to be inconclusive.”
Howard and colleagues used
ultrasound to measure how much
the carotid-artery walls thickened
over a three-year period in

10,914 adults aged 45-65.
Subjects who had smoked on
average one pack a day for 33
years had a 50 percent increase in
the progression of hardening of
their arteries when compared to
non-smokers. The condition,
called atherosclerosis, is linked
to strokes, heart attacks and other
cardiovascular problems.
Among past smokers — who
had previously smoked an
average of a pack daily for 25
years — a 25 percent increase in
progression was found.

A "3.0” can be more than a dream for some
SIUE students in extra-curricular activities
A 3.0 is not too far fetched
for some students
There should be a university
requirement that students have a
3.0 grade point average (out of a
possible 4.0) in order to
participate in any extracurricular
activity. Many students like this
idea because they believe it
pushes them harder to either
obtain or maintain a 3.0 grade
point average or better. Some say
that they are less likely to lose
sight of which is more important:
school work or extracurricular
activities. Furthermore, students
can develop new skills, explore
possible careers, and add
experiences to their resumes.
However, participating in
extracurricular activities comes
with some risks as well. For
example, when students do not
balance extracurricular activities
with their class work, their
success in school can suffer,
specifically their grade point
averages. But when students
realize that their grades are
beginning to suffer, belonging to
an organization requiring a grade

point average of 3.0 or better,
gives them that extra push, in
addition to reinforcing the
importance of securing good
grades.
Extracurricular
activities
demand a significant amount of
time and commitment. With this
kind of involvement comes a host
of
potential
benefits.
Extracurricular activity is one of
the oldest ways by which college
students
can
acquire
the
experience they will need in the
workforce.
Traditionally,
a
student could sign up or join an
extracurricular activity without
question,
but
now
more
universities are requiring that
students have a 3.0 grade point
average in order to participate in
any extracurricular activity.
Many students, faculty, and
parents believe that when
students know ahead of time that
there is an academic requirement
for participation, grades for
members will be higher.
Generally, most students
believe that getting a good
education and obtaining a grade

point average of 3.0 or better is
an excellent way of establishing
priorities. These students also
believe that the competition will
help them to remain alert and
focused on their personal goals
and achievements.
Given their required grade
point
averages
and
their
competitive skills, these students
seem to graduate in four years, or
at least earlier than students who
do not have the required grade
point averages. Statistics have
shown that students with higher
grade point averages are more
likely to be selected for early
recommendations.
Cherly Heard, assistance
director
of
the
Kimmel
Leadership Department at SIUE,
says, “The requirement (students
having a 3.0 grade point average)
is a great idea.” However,
according to SIUE statistics on
Greek Life, many of the students
would not be able to participate
because the average grade point
average in the Greek community
is 2.6. These statistics may also
reveal how some students might

fail to do their very best,
considering the requirement for
joining
most
Greek
Organizations means having only
a 2.25 grade point average.
Having a 3.0 grade point
average may be important for
some, but many students feel that
this requirement can be too
stressful on those who believe
they have done their best, and are
totally content with their 2.25
grade point average. But these
students may soon realize that an
extra two hours of studying and
research will certainly enable
them to increase their grade point
average and their self-esteem.
Many students may also feel that
they have not reached their fullest
potential. A grade point average
of 3.0 may seem like a long way
from a 2.25, but once students
realize that all it takes is a little
effort, their philosophy often
changes and their attitude
towards the requirement becomes
more understanding. As a result,
these students would want to
increase their grade point
averages. After all, being the best

student one can be is the greatest
achievement.
All
things
considered,
education is the most important
criterion for most students
attending college. Students who
have successfully maintained a
3.0 grade point average often feel
better about themselves and their
self-worth.
Participating
in
extracurricular activities gives
many students a balance between
academics
and
social
enhancement. Primarily, only
students who demonstrate a high
level of academic competence
should be allowed to participate
in extracurricular activities.
These students understand that
the importance of a quality
education comes before all other
feats. However, students who are
not academically astute at first,
will soon realize that the extra
effort committed to their studies
will reap the greatest rewards for
them in the future.

Slain civil rights leader’s message won’t be complete
without acknowledgement of the plight of homosexuals
While traveling with my wife Cheryle over the break,
we took the time while passing through Birmingham,
Alabama to visit the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.
The institute tells the story of how AfricanAmericans struggled for civil rights through the Jim Crow
era in the South, particularly during the late 1950s and
1960s. Martin Luther King Jr. emerged as one of the many
African-American leaders in Montgomery, Selma, and
Birmingham. The Institute accurately and painfully tells
the stories of all the civil rights leaders who emerged in
this era. The Institute also exhibits items that Generation
Xers like me would never recall seeing like “Colored
Only” water fountains, entrance signs, park benches, bus
seats etc. One’s senses are assaulted with images of
bombed churches, hanged black men, KKK rallies, bus
loads of demonstrators being carted off to jail, sit-ins,
police dogs attacking, bruised faces and shattered souls.

Letters to the editor policy:
The editors, staff and publishers of the Alestle believe in
the free exchange of ideas, concerns and opinions and will
publish as many letters to the editor as possible. All letters
should be typed and double-spaced and be no longer than
500 words. Please include your phone number, signature
and social security number.
We reserve the right to edit letters for grammar and
content However, great care will be taken to ensure that the
message of the letter is not lost or altered.
Letters to the editor will not be printed anonymously
except under extrem e circum stances.
The Alestle is a m em ber o f the Illinois College
Press Association.
The name Alestle is an acronym derived from the
nam es o f the three cam pus locations o f SIUE:
Alton, East St. Louis and Edwardsville.

History and the Institute portray the civil rights
struggle as a struggle for human rights. The last part of the
exhibit ends with the March on Washington and Martin
Luther King’s, “I Have A Dream” speech. Afterwards,
there is a transition into the final part of the exhibit
outlining remaining struggles throughout the world for
basic rights. All the bases were covered except sexual
orientation. I found it disappointing that gays, lesbians
and bisexuals were not included under this blanket of
human rights by an institution founded on this ethic. I
guess I could imply from this lack of inclusion that civil
rights leaders as portrayed by the Institute would turn their
backs on gaybashing, employment discrimination,
homophobia and illegality of same-sex marriages and
partner benefits. I guess they would applaud when gay
leaders like Harvey Milk are gunned down so they could
silence their message of gay rights and equality. I guess

they would support the U.S. Military’s refusal to allow
openly gay soldiers to fight for their country.
I admire Martin Luther King, Jr. but I hate to see his
message selectively ignored or omitted. While you enjoy
your time off in King’s honor this Monday, remember that
people are still struggling for human rights everywhere. If
you would like to remind the Birmingham Civil Rights
Institute of this, tell them. Write to: Birmingham Civil
Rights Institute, 520 16th St. N., Birmingham, AL 35203.
Tell them some big goofy bisexual dude told you so.
Please tell them their “human rights” exhibit is
incomplete. I did.

St. Louis screenwriter claims “Twister” is his script
ST. LOUIS (AP) — A
suburban St. Louis screenwriter
claims efforts to sell his script
about two teams that chase
tornadoes across Oklahoma
ended with a cruel twist.
Instead of picking Steven
Kessler to write a Hollywood
movie, Michael Crichton and
Steven Spielberg took the script
and turned it into the 1996
blockbuster movie “Twister,”
said Kessler’s lawyer.
Kessler is asking a 10member jury in U.S. District
Court to award him all the
movie’s profits as damages for
infringing on his copyright.
Martin Green, Kessler’s
lawyer, estimates the movie
made nearly
$240 million.
Crichton’s lawyer, Bob Dudnik,
says the figure is closer to $150

million.
Opening statements in the
trial were heard Monday with
Crichton and Kessler in the
courtroom. Crichton said he will
be at the trial as much as he can.
Green told jurors that
Kessler wrote the screenplay,
“Catch the Wind,” in 1989 and
submitted it in a contest. Kessler
was a semifinalist and copies of
the script were distributed to
producers of “Twister” and
Crichton’s representatives.
Kessler then flew to Los
Angeles in 1989 to discuss with
executives the possibility of
turning the screenplay into a
movie. But he never heard from
anyone after 1992, Green said.
“Several years went by and
he heard that a movie about
tornadoes was being created,”

Green said. “This was the
brainstorm of Steven Kessler.” •
Close to 90 percent of
“Twister” was taken from
“Catch the Wind,” Green said.
“They essentially are one in
the same,” Green said.
But Dudnik said neither
Crichton nor his wife, AnneMarie Martin, who co-wrote the
script, saw Kessler’s screenplay
or knew it existed until Kessler
filed his lawsuit in 1996.
“This case is not just about
money,” Dudnik said. “This case
is about honor.”
Dudnik
said
although
“Twister” and “Catch the
Wind,” are about characters who
chase tornadoes, they have
different
plots,
characters,
themes and settings.
“Ideas are not protected by

copyright,”
Dudnik
said.
“Unoriginal ideas are not
protected by copyright.”
But an expert witness
testifying for Kessler on
Monday said that the movie and
the screenplay contain too many
substantial similarities that are
impossible to overlook.
“It’s
not
just
one
coincidence,
or
two
coincidences,” said Randolf
Pope, a professor of comparative
literature
at
Washington
University in St. Louis.
Pope counted 14 of what he
called major plot similarities
between
“Twister”
and
Kessler’s
screenplay.
For
instance,
both
deal
with
scientists trying to put devices
inside a tornado, he said. The
heroes of both films also have

love interests and are advised by
older relatives. They also are
competing against enemies who
are former co-workers, he
added.
Jurors watched “Twister” at
the end of the day Monday and
will read Kessler’s screenplay
this week.
The lawsuit also names
Spielberg’s
Amblin
Entertainment
Inc.,
which
produced “Twister,” as well as
Warner Bros. Inc. and Universal
Studios, the movie’s owner.
Crichton said that all of his
Hollywood efforts, beginning
with his 1969 “Andromeda
Strain,” have been targeted by
outsiders who claimed they had
the idea for the story.
This is the first of those
claims to go before a jury.

Man gets arm stuck under hood, freezes to death trying to pull it free
COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) —
An 84-year-old man froze to
death after his arm became
pinned under the hood of
a pickup truck he was working
on at a remote auto lot,

officials said.
Elery Settle lived on the
Four Corners Auto Sales lot just
north of the Boone County line.
That’s where he was found
Sunday afternoon, dead of

hypothermia. His body was
discovered by the lot’s owner.
“He was just a little old man
who got his arm caught and
couldn’t get out,” Audrain
County coroner Kevin Farnen

said. “The hood was heavy, and
he was in a kind of an unusual
situation.”
Settle was last seen Friday,
officials said.
“He was in a place where

nobody would notice him,”
Farnen said. “It is a remote area
there on the weekends. It
appeared to happen on Saturday
afternoon.”

Missouri’s methamphetamine
problems continue with arrest
of six drug ring members
CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (AP) — Six
southeast Missouri men were sentenced to prison
Tuesday for their role in a large methamphe­
tamine ring.
The men were sentenced in federal court after
pleading guilty to conspiracy to manufacture the
drug. Meth is considered one of the nation’s fastest
growing drug problems, particularly in rural areas.
“Without question, this is one of the largest
operational methamphetamine laboratories we have
taken down to date,” U.S. Attorney Edward L.
Dowd Jr. said. He said the men were making the
drug in several southeast Missouri counties.
The men were arrested after an investigation
involving several southeast Missouri law
enforcement agencies and the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration.

In July, police found a methamphetamine lab at
a home in rural Cape Girardeau County. All of the
defendants were in and around the home, Dowd
said.
Steven Clifton Lawson, 31, of New Madrid,
received the longest sentence, 14 years. Others
sentenced Tuesday were: James Earnest Cagle, 37,
of Campbell, sentenced to eight years and four
months;
Jeffrey Dale Green, 38, of Sikeston, sentenced
to eight years and one month;
Michael William Marberry, 38, of Cape
Girardeau, sentenced to nine years and six months;
Paul Marberry, 36, of Cape Girardeau,
sentenced to seven years and six months;
Douglas Dale Turner, 27, of Cape Girardeau,
sentenced to seven years.

Woman apprehended during
tour for spraying paint in the
White House Blue Room
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
woman touring the White House
today sprayed rust-colored paint
in the Blue Room and was taken
into custody by Secret Service
agents,
a
White
House
spokesman said.
The woman caused more
than $1,000 damage to the room’s
wall coverings and defaced two
“rather priceless” busts of
Christopher
Columbus
and
Amerigo Vespucci that are
among the oldest sculptures in
the White House, spokesman
Mike McCurry said.
McCurry described the
woman,
who
was
not
immediately
identified,
as
between the ages of 30 and 35.
“I ’m told she was taken into
custody and was rather calm
about it,” he said. Her motive

was not clear.
McCurry said the woman
was on one of the daily public
tours when, just after noon, she
began spraying paint at the busts
on 5-foot pedestals and was
interrupted
by
a
nearby
uniformed Secret Service agent.
Secret Service officials did
not immediately return calls for
comment.
The two busts will be
removed for repair, but tours of
the mansion would not otherwise
be affected, McCurry said. Citing
a fear of copycat vandals, White
House officials refused to allow
news cameras to film the damage.
“This president and this first
lady are committed to keeping
the residence open to the
American public,” he said.

Know your world,

Dead man’s estate ordered to pay
$1 million for girlfriend’s death
EDWARDSVILLE, 111. (AP)
— The estate of a man killed in a
fire has been ordered to pay $1
million to the family of his
girlfriend, also killed in the
1991 blaze.
A Madison County jury on
Friday instructed the estate of
Coy D. Eckhouse to pay $1
million to Pamela Politte’s estate
and children for her death in
the early-morning fire at his
house near Piasa Harbor in
Jersey County.
Witnesses for Politte’s estate
testified Eckhouse disconnected
or removed the batteries from a
smoke detector without telling

Politte, because it went off when
he cooked. Illinois law requires
tenants to keep smoke detectors
in working order.
Politte’s body was found just
six feet from the door. Attorney
Lanny Darr II, who represented
Politte’s estate, said a functional
smoke detector would have
given her sufficient warning to
save herself.
Both Politte, 42, and
Eckhouse, 37, died of smoke and
carbon monoxide inhalation.
Eckhouse’s body was found in
his bed. The smoke detector was
never recovered from the burnedout house.

The jury awarded $650,000
to Politte’s three children for the
loss of her affection and support
and an additional $350,000 to
Politte’s estate for her pain and
suffering in the minutes before
her death.
Defense attorney Robert
Wuller Jr. said Eckhouse’s
income did not justify the size of
the damages awarded. He also
argued that she would not have
suffered much before falling
unconscious.
Wuller said he will ask the
judge to set aside the verdict or
order a new trial. If that fails, he
will appeal, he said.

Severns wants to ban human cloning

■6 w eeks, 6 credits, a bo ut $ 2,400 including tuition, room &
board, books, and airfare.

SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) —
Sen. Penny Severns said she will
introduce legislation Wednesday
to ban human cloning, less than
a week after a potential
opponent in the secretary of
state’s race called for similar
action.
Severns joined the list of
politicians,
from
President
Clinton to members of Congress
reacting to statements last week
by
Chicago-area
scientist
Richard
Seed.
The
self­

described eccentric said he is
trying to get the money to set up
an independent clinic to produce
human clones within two years.
“Human cloning puts us all
on the edge of a very dangerous
cliff that we do not want to fall
off of as a society,” a Severns
statement said.
Severns is a Democratic
candidate for secretary of state.
Last Thursday,
Robert
Churchill,
a
key
House
Republican leader and GOP

secretary of state candidate,
pushed to revive a similarly
proposed ban that stalled last
spring in the House.
Former state Rep. A1 Salvi,
another Republican seeking to
be secretary of state, said he
opposed cloning and supported
legislation to ban the procedure.
But Salvi said the issue is
“too important for us to allow
politicians to demagogue” and
irrelevant to the secretary of
state’s office.

Body of ‘63 church bombing
victim missing from gravesite
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP)
— Relatives of one of four black
girls killed in an infamous 1963
church bombing suffered more
heartache after learning her body
wasn’t in the grave they visited
for years.
Workers
attempting
to
disinter the remains of 14-yearold Addie Mae Collins for
reburial at another cemetery
could not locate them under a
tombstone marking what was
believed to be her grave.
A funeral home worker
speculated Tuesday that the
marker was simply put in the
wrong place. The headstone was
installed at a ceremony several
years ago to properly remember
the victim of the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church bombing, a crime
by white racists that shocked
the nation.
A thin, upright wooden
board was all that marked the
grave before donors raised
money to buy the stone.
The family had hoped to
reinter the child’s body Tuesday,
but the ceremony was postponed.
“I had been going to the
cemetery putting flowers there
for years, and just to find out she
wasn’t there, it just really downs
my spirits,” Sarah Cox, the slain
girl’s sister, told television
station WBMA.
Relatives wanted to move
Addie Mae’s remains to wellkept Elmwood Cemetery because
Greenwood Cemetery fell into
horrible disrepair after being
abandoned
after
the
girl
was buried.

“We’re kind of upset
because we were looking
forward to the interment,” said
Mrs. Cox. “We’re just going to
wait until they find her, because
we can’t do nothing without the
body.”
Bones were visible Tuesday
inside two deteriorated graves
near Miss Collins’ tombstone.
Dozens of headstones are
toppled, and numerous graves are
sunken in. Trash dots the
hillside, which overlooks the
Birmingham airport.
But a bright bouquet of red
and yellow silk flowers was
pushed into the soft, rain-soaked
clay where workers searched
Monday for the girl’s remains.
The work was to continue as the
weather allowed.
Paul Gardner of Smith &
Gaston Funeral Home, which
was to handle the disinterment,
said records from the cemetery
were poorly kept and Addie
Mae’s tombstone apparently was
erected in the wrong location but
could be found in the ground.
“I think they’re going to
look around in the general
vicinity of where they were told
the body was,” said Gardner.
Abraham
Woods
Jr.,
president of the Birmingham
chapter of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, who
attended both the 1963 burial and
the later dedication of the
tombstone, went to the site
Tuesday, where digging had not
resumed by mid-afternoon.
He said hundreds went to the
cemetery for the burial in 1963

and the current digging is in the
area where the body was buried,
but he said he could not be
certain if the headstone was at
the exact spot where the body
was laid.
Before the stone marker was
erected, he said, the grave was
indicated only by “a wooden
plank driven in the ground and it
was said that was where she was
buried. I’m wondering now if
there was a mistake made.”
He said the cemetery has not
had a caretaker in years and the
record-keeping was poor.
“I imagine there are lots of
people in this cemetery whose
graves can’t be found because
the records just weren’t kept up,”
he said.
A worker at Elmwood said a
crypt was waiting for Addie
Mae’s reinterment. “It’s a sad
situation. I hate if for the
family,” said Mike Riley.
Addie Mae died with Carole
Robertson and Cynthia Wesley,
both 14, and Denise McNair, 11,
when a bomb exploded at the
church on Sunday, Sept. 15,
1963. Denise is the only victim
not buried at Greenwood.
Ku Klux Klan member
Robert Edward Chambliss was
convicted in the blast and died in
prison. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation
reopened
its
investigation last year, but no
new charges have been filed.
Filmmaker Spike Lee’s
movie about the bombing and its
victims, “4 Little Girls,” is to be
shown on Home Box Office in
about a month.

Return phone number helps police
trace alleged pizza bandits
NEWPORT, Ky. (AP) —
Pizza order is verified and
alleged robbers are nabbed.
Police
used
the
customer’s telephone number
to trace the apartment where a
Papa Jo hn ’s delivery man
was robbed at gunpoint early
Sunday.
Because Papa John’s takes
customers’ phone numbers so
it can call back and verify

orders, police had a number
that Cincinnati Bell Telephone
Co. could trace.
When officers arrived at
the apartment, they double­
checked by hitting redial on
the telephone, police said
Monday.
Papa
John’s
answered the call.
Police
arrested
a
Cincinnati
man,
Jodie
Wallace, 18, and a 17-year-old

Newport boy on a charge of
first-degree robbery. The boy,
whose name was not released,
was charged as a juvenile.
The robbers had taken
$30, a couple of pizzas and a
bottle of soda pop from the
delivery man, said police
spokesman Sgt. Coy Cox.
Police
recovered
the
money, a gun and the empty
pizza boxes.

Middle school girls suspended for threatening
voodoo upon their classmates in Georgia
M A BLET ON , Ga. (AP)
— Two eighth-grade girls can
return to class after five-day
suspensions for attempting to
practice
voodoo
on
classmates, a Cobb County
school official said Monday.
The two girls were sent
home from Lindley Middle
School before winter break
after school officials said
they attempted to put spells

on
other
students
after
reading a juvenile book about
witches.
Cobb
County
school
spokesman Jay Dillon would
not confirm that the girls
returned to school Monday,
nor comment further on the
specifics of this case.
“We have a strong policy
against students threatening
other students or disrupting

school in any way,” Dillon
said. “ In those situations, it’s
up to the principals discretion
to take action to keep order.
“ We just cannot have
situations where students are
disrupting
the
learning
process,” Dillon said.
“Lindley Principal Judy
Whaley could not be reached
for comment Monday.

“Kundun,” Martin Scorsese's
latest film, is a story of
indomitable will and the enduring
power of compassion.
Seven years ago, screenwriter
Melissa Mathison (E.T.) began
her research on the story of the
14th Dalai Lama. “Kundun” is
told through the eyes of His
Holiness, and shows the stark
contrasts between the deeply
spiritual and introspective world
of Tibetan Buddhism and
socialist China in the 40s and 50s.
The story is as historically
accurate as it is visually
compelling. Not only is it a
masterful work of art, but also an
eye-opening and revealing look
at the sheer evil of the horrors
inflicted by the Red Army upon
the Tibetan people. The Chinese
government was so outraged by
the film that they refused to allow
the movie to be filmed in Tibet.
Instead, the film was shot in
Morocco, where Scorsese and his
team of visual effect wizards
were forced to create several
digital matte paintings. All of the
visual effects are integrated so
seamlessly into the high desert
mountains that the effect is as

^

o

real as the story is historically
significant.
It’s Tibet against China, good
against evil, spirituality against
godless communism, and in a
larger sense, the isolated and pure
Tibet against a changing,
dynamic world.
And in the middle of a world

‘Babe’ star attempts to save real-life pigs Blind drunk breaks out of jail
OCALA, Fla. (AP) — James Cromwell, the star
of the swine-friendly movie “Babe,” is trying to
save from slaughter a second pig raised by
mentally-challenged students.
Cromwell last March came to the rescue of
Dragon I, a 240-pound porker destined for the
butcher’s block. The boar was raised as a 4-H
project by mentally-challenged students at Hillcrest
School, a public school for handicapped students.
Dragon I was sold for almost $5,000, which the
school targeted for supplies.
Representatives of People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals were able to talk the highest
bidder into selling them the pig for the $1,700.
Cromwell, who was nominated for an Academy
Award for his role as Farmer Hoggett in “Babe,”
then agreed to reimburse PETA for the pig, which is
now residing in a nearby sanctuary.
The pig’s successor, Dragon II, is currently being
raised by the students and is destined for the auction
block next month, said principal Michael Barnett.
“We went into this project with the full
awareness that the pigs that are raised go to
slaughter,” Barnett said.
In a letter to the principal, Cromwell urged
Barnett to send Dragon II to a sanctuary.
“The kids would jump for joy if they knew the
animals were going to be safe,” Cromwell said in
the letter.

LONDON (AP) — A blind man who drove two miles while drunk
before crashing into a parked car escaped jail Monday after his lawyer
told the court the man was “terrified” of what might happen to
him there.
Peter Langley pleaded guilty at a Devon magistrates court to
driving while nearly two-and-a-half times over the alcohol limit.
With three previous drunken driving convictions, the magistrates
considered sending Langley to prison, but his lawyer pleaded with
them not to. Langley, 40, who suffers from glaucoma, is completely
blind in one eye and suffers tunnel vision in the other.
“A severely disabled person thrown into prison is likely to be the
butt of all sorts of things,” defense attorney John Darby said.
The magistrates put Langley on two years probation on the
condition that he seek alcoholic counseling and fined him 100 pounds
($161). By law, they also had to ban him from driving for three years.
The owner of the parked car had witnessed the crash from his
window and called the police, who tested Langley’s alcohol level.
“My client never intended to drive, but both he and his partner had
been drinking and she wasn’t fit to drive,” Darby told the court.
“He was concerned with his failing eyesight about wandering
around the streets ... in the dark,” the lawyer said “This is where
stupidity took over.”

FINDLAY, Ohio (AP) —
Trying to find the person who
inserted
scenes
from
pornographic movies into films
from the family section of the
library is going to be difficult.
That’s why the FindlayHancock County Public Library
is warning parents to monitor the
library videos their children
watch, Director Sybil Galer
said Thursday.
“We’re taking this very
seriously,” she said. “I don't
know who would do something
like this.”
Four families who borrowed
the movies from the library this
week saw the pornographic
scenes at the end of the tapes.
Galer feared that the unknown
editor is targeting children.
She also was afraid that there
are more porn clips among the
18,000 videos at the library in
this city 40 miles south of Toledo.
People check out about 1,000
videos per day, making it nearly
impossible for her staff to go

through each one.
“The staff has volunteered to
take armloads home with them at
night to review them,” she said.
The pornographic footage
followed the credits in “Bugs
Bunny’s Wacky Adventures,”
“Bugs Bunny’s Mad World of
Television,”
“Alice
in
Wonderland” and “Send Me No
Flowers,” a Doris Day - Rock
Hudson film.
Different scenes showing
people having sex appear on each
of the tapes. One clip ran about
nine minutes long. The parents
who had borrowed the movies
were watching the videos with
their children and turned them off
right away, Galer said.
The library is working with
city police to identify the person
who inserted the porn scenes, but
Galer said it won’t be easy.
The library has a computer
system that automatically deletes
the name of a person who
borrows a video after it is
returned.

Most U.S. libraries have the
same system to protect the
privacy of their customers,
she said.
“There are other ways we can
find them,” Galer said. He
declined to elaborate. Police
officials did not return a
telephone call.
K.C. Collette, an assistant
prosecutor in Hancock County,
said he did not know what charge
to file against any suspects.
“We haven’t even looked into
that yet. There are statutes out
there that talk about desecration
of public property,” he said.
American Library Association
spokeswoman Carolyn Kubisz
said she had not heard of similar
cases, “but I can’t imagine this is
the only place that has ever
done it.”
There have been reports of
pornographic footage briefly
airing accidentally during cable
television shows.

Kundun --------------------------from page 10
The movie has a slow pace which is moved more
by visual imagery than dialogue. Buddhist imagery
is particularly important in the film, as it shows the
impermanence of all living things on earth and the
eternal truths (in the religion of Buddha) that
wisdom and compassion are the only things which
will save humanity. At the beginning of the film
images of sacred sand spread over a mandala are
shown with time-lapse photography as they begin to
emerge, forming a beautiful pattern. Near the end of
the film, the sand is wiped off the mandala by a
disembodied arm. The intricate artwork is destroyed
in a matter of seconds. This is powerful, compelling
symbolism which shows the rise and fall of
Tibetan culture.
The events leading to the fall of this culture are
what “Kundun” is all about. The great dichotomy in
the story occurs when the Red Army invades Tibet
and the Dalai Lama must decide to fight, flee or stay.
To allow China to steal their society, to take away
their silence, is to give up everything for which they
live. But nothing is more unlike Buddhism than
violence, and the Dalai Lama's 5,000-man army is
little match for Chairman Mao's giant army. So the
innocent and faithful Dalai Lama chooses to stay for
awhile and pray for a peaceful resolution. The
resolution of the movie leaves the Dalai Lama on
uncertain ground — he has fled Tibet but the
Chinese government may yet capture him.
The cast members portraying the Dalai Lama —
all of whom are young Tibetans — do a wonderful
job, imbuing the character with a delightful mix of
nobility and childlike charm. The actors are age two,
five, 12 and 18. Robert Lin, a Chinese American
actor, delivers a brilliant performance as the ruthless

Chairman Mao. He is smooth, cool and devilishly
manipulative — he gets what he wants. He is always
coughing and smoking a cigarette in the movie and
he makes you wish he would choke to death.
The movie has plenty of comic relief amid the
tragedy — including a mouse that sneaks into the
sanctuary again and again, sipping holy water. It’s
hard not to be touched by this substantial and very
pertinent historical re-telling.
From an aesthetic standpoint, with its mysterious
musical score, brilliant photography, elaborate
costumes, designs and sets, “Kundun” may rank as a
masterpiece. But from a social and political
standpoint, “Kundun” is even more important.
“Kundun” has been seven years in the making,
and I’m glad to see its release in America. It may not
be a box-office smash, as westerners typically prefer
fast-paced action movies, but it is a well-executed,
thoroughly researched, and accurate depiction of a
very important historical event.
“Kundun” is rated PG-13 and opens in theaters
this weekend.

Morris Dees, from the civil rights era to present, has worked in
aiding minorities in court and has founded the Southern Poverty
Law Center. The Center is a non-profit group that maintains a
pool of lawyers who specialize in lawsuits involving civil-rights
and racially motivated crimes. His Klanwatch operation monitors
organized racist activity across the nation, and his Militia Task
Force tracks the activities of more than 400 unauthorized militia
units. The FBI notified Dees in 1984 that he was on the hit list of
the militia group, The Order. This group killed Alan Berg, the
Denver radio talk-show host in 1984. Dees was portrayed by
Wayne Rogers in Ghost of Mississippi, a feature film released in
1996 about the life of slain civil rights worker Medgar Evers.

Misi Clark named GLVC player of the week
■BY JASON TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
Freshman guard Misi Clark is not
playing like she was in high school
last year, and after getting the Great
Lakes Valley Conference Player of
the Week respects, she is beginning
to get the point across that she is no
ordinary first year player.
UNS
At the start of the season, the
M isi Clark
Paris, Illinois native averaged 10.4
points throughout the first five games. What earned her
Player of the Week honors was her 25.5 points per game
and 51 points total in two games. Last week she shot 12-

18 from the field, 4-5 from three-point land, made 23-31
from the free throw line, got eight rebounds, dealt three
assists, and picked up four steals. All fans can say is
‘Wow’.
“People still don’t believe that number 3 is a
freshman,” Head Coach Wendy Hedberg said. “We hope
the more she plays the more she’s going to pick up and
adjust her game.”
She also broke the SIUE and GLVC record for free
throws made(18) and attempted(24) in the January 10th
game against UMSL.
Clarks’ level of play rose at just the right time when
they faced top-ranked Southern Indiana and the ever
tough University of Missouri-St. Louis in the past week.
Against USI she scored 21 points in her 38 minutes and

handed out 4 assists. And against UMSL she led all
scorers with 30 points in the victory.
“Misi is a gamer, she is competitive, yet she will not
force things,” Hedberg said. “She has been consistent and
has kept her head when freshmen are prone to be sketchy.”
Clark is leading the GLVC in steals. Averaging 3.3 a
game, she is in the top ten in scoring with 16.5 a game,
field goal percentage at .528, and with 50 assists in
fourteen games.
Clark is a fine addition to an already strong SIUE
squad. Senior Kim Lowe leads the GLVC in rebounding
and is in the top ten in steals and field goal percentage.
Also, forwards Alicia Harkins and Leslie Phillips are
major contributors to the Cougars success so far.

No. 10 Cougars wrestle with few losses over break
■ BY BRIAN ANDERSON
SPORTS REPORTER
Over Christmas break, the Southern
Illinois University at Edwardsville
wrestlers failed to live up to their No. 9
ranking by dropping their first two dual
meets of the year to Missouri Valley, 2419, and to No. 2 Central Oklahoma 39-6.
Against Missouri Valley, 118 pound
Mike Mabry, 126 pound Tim Michel, and
134 pound Denale Powell started off the
Cougar season with a bang by posting
three consecutive wins. 150 pound Elijah
Roberts and HWT Steve Brown also
recorded victories for the Cougars.
However, SIUE could not hold the lead
after dropping five of the next seven
matches. Three of those five matches were
lost by SIUE having to forfeit due to an
empty weight-class.
Against Central Oklahoma, the lone
bright spot for the Cougars was Elijah
Roberts, who pinned Jody Marple in 2

minutes and 55 seconds in a 7 minute
match. Elijah Roberts, a junior from Rock
Island, continues to make a strong case for
himself as one of the nation’s best at 150
pounds. Roberts was selected as the
tournaments Most Outstanding Wrestler
after winning four matches, three pins and
a 7-6 decision over No. 2 nationally
ranked Lazaro Reinoso from Carson
Newman. Roberts has been the top
wrestler for the cougars so far and
posts a 14-2 record with 5 pins and 3
technical falls.
“Elijah is as good as any kid in the
nation at his weight class,” SIUE wrestling
coach Larry Kristoff said.
The Cougars then hit the Indianapolis
Open, but only after losing two meets and
falling one slot to the No. 10 position in
the NCAA Division II Wrestling Coaches’
Association Top 20 poll.
The Indianapolis Open has been a
competitive tournament in years past and
was no different this year. The Open held

more than 20 NCAA Div. I, II, NAIA and
community college schools.
“This is a real good, tough tournament
loaded with top Division II programs,”
coach Kristoff said.
Knowing this was going to be a tough
tournament, SIUE prepared well as five of
nine cougars that participated returned
home with a medal. As a team, the
Cougars finished 6th out of the 17 highly
regarded teams from division I & II.
Junior Elijah Roberts claimed the
tournament’s MVP and became the 150pound champion, pinning his way to the
finals and defeating No.2 nationallyranked Lazaro Reinoso from Carson
Newman 7-6.
Returning All-American Jason Carter
wrestled tough, going 3-1 to take second
place in the 190 pound class. Carter
recorded one pin during the tournament
and lost a tight 5-3 match in the finals.
Carter was nationally ranked no. 1 before
the tournament.

Other outstanding Cougar performers
were freshman Tim Michel, 5th in 126
pound class, junior William Glass, 7th at
158 lbs., and sophomore Steve Brown, 7th
at heavyweight.
“I expect us to get better as the season
goes on, but I am satisfied with our
performance this past weekend,” coach
Kristoff said.
The Cougars had trouble filling all the
weight classes, but coach Kristoff plans to
fill the ten weight classes as the season
continues. A possible standout for the
Cougars is junior Titus Taylor, who has
been absent from the Cougar line-up, but
plans to wrestle for the first time this
season against Truman.
The Cougars next wrestling meet will
be held on Saturday, January 17th in the
UNI Duals in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The
Cougars will return home on Saturday,
January 31 and go up against Central
Missouri State at 2 p.m. at the Vadalabene
Center.

Men’s hoops hopeful against Wisconsin-Parkside Cougars open track season
■BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
In his six seasons at SIUE,
head coach Jack Margenthaler
has never seen a start like his
men’s basketball team has had
this year.
His squad will try and
improve on the 11-2 record that
has earned them a No. 21 ranking
in the nation when they take on

will tip-off at 7:30 p.m.
The Cougars will put their 5-1

“They have a good inside

game,” Margenthaler said. “Their
size down low will create match­
up problems for us since we don’t
have the kind of big players that
they have.”
Margenthaler thinks that
changing his game plan to suit
Wisconsin-Parkside’s size would
be unwise since his team has had
so much success with the way
that they have been playing.
“We’ll try to put pressure on
the post, but we need to continue
with what we have been doing,”
Margenthaler said. “Our defense
has improved tremendously since
last year and we’ve been doing an
excellent job of rebounding.”
The GLVC’s sixth place team,
Lewis,
will
invade
the
Vadalabene Center on Saturday
posing the same size problems as

Wisconsin-Parkside.
“Lewis has good post players
too,” Margenthaler said. “Since
both of our up-coming games are
against good inside teams, it lets
us really focus on guarding that
style of play at practice.”
Margenthaler credits his
team’s outstanding start to
unselfish play on the offensive
end.
“So many players are carrying
the load,” Margenthaler said.
“It’s a unique situation. There is
not one player who is playing
extremely well, but everyone is
doing their part to contribute.
We’ve been making a lot of
progress so far and with 12
important conference games left,
we can’t take any team lightly.”

SPORTS REPORTER
Take your marks, get set, go!
A visit to Charleston, Illinois
for the Eastern Illinois Open
kicked off the season for the
SIUE men’s and women’s track
teams in mid-December.
In a meet which included all
three NCAA divisions, Junior
Bill Beckley took top honors for
the Cougars. The Harper College
transfer took first place in the
800 meter run.
Freshman Josh Ritzel showed
his ability in the long jump with
a jump of just under 20 feet.
Ritzel also ran a 53.31 in the
400 meters.
On the women’s side, Nicole
Done and Lisa Ribes finished
third and fifth respectively in the
3000 meter run. Done ran the
race in 11:09.89 and Ribes
finished with a time of 11:15.12.
Junior Janece Friederich also
ran well in her first meet since

high school. Friederich ran a
27.93 in the 200 meters after a
slow start out of the blocks.
“We’ve been training hard for
this season,” assistant coach
Kevin Warner said. “Most of our
distance people should do well
this year.”
With mostly new faces on the
two teams this year, Warner
would like to see the squads get
some more competition under
their belts.
“With this being the first
collegiate meet for a lot of
our participants, it will take a
little time to get adjusted,”
Warner said. “College meets are
very different from those in
high school, so after a couple
more meets they’ll know what
to expect.”
Both the men’s and women’s
track teams are back in action on
Jan. 24 when they travel to
Bloomington, 111. for the Illinois
Wesleyan Invitational.

Leaks about new Cowboy coach are unfounded
IRVING, Texas (AP) — Leaks keep hindering Dallas
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones’ secretive coaching search.
The man he just paid off, Barry Switzer, has been one
of the loose cannons Jones would like to tie down.
On Sunday, Switzer told an Oklahoma television
station that George Seifert “will not be the coach of the
Dallas Cowboys.”
The former San Francisco coach ends his contract with
the 49ers on Feb. 1 and is one of the NFL’s hottest
coaching candidates. Seifert has said he would be
interested in coaching the Cowboys.
The Dallas Morning News on Monday reported that
Switzer, acting on a request from Jones, had called
Denver coach Mike Shanahan about offensive coordinator
Gary Kubiak.
Shanahan gave Switzer an uplifting report about
Kubiak, who has been offensive coordinator three years
and was a backup to John Elway for nine seasons.
Shanahan said after Sunday’s 24-21 AFC

championship win over Pittsburgh that Kubiak “would
make a great head coach.”
“If Jerry calls me I ’ll let him talk to Gary,” Shanahan
said.
Under Kubiak, the Broncos have ranked first in the
NFL the last two seasons. Offensive problems sank the
Cowboys last season as they plummeted to 6-10 and failed
to make the playoffs for the first time in seven years.
This is an off-week before the Super Bowl and the
Cowboys could call Kubiak with Denver’s permission.
Kubiak hasn’t said whether he is interested.
Jones was working the telephones on Monday, but not
returning telephone calls to the media.
Jones was stung last week when Switzer’s resignation
became public before he wished. He has vowed that his
coaching search will be bug free.
“There will be no details about the candidates,” Jones
said. “If you hear any speculation, it won’t have any
foundation unless it comes from me. I will not divulge my

process.”
Jones did say two things: the next coach won’t be him
and he’ll announce Switzer’s replacement sometime in
February.
Switzer had no comment on former Notre Dame coach
Lou Holtz, former UCLA coach Terry Donahue,
Philadelphia offensive coordinator Jon Gruden or
candidates from the Dallas assistant ranks.
Meanwhile, the assistant coaches are dutifully studying
film from last season while awaiting word from Jones if
they will be retained.
Offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese has a guaranteed
contract through next season, but believes he will be fired
anyway. Quarterback coach Jack Reilly has another year
remaining on his contact.
Defensive coordinator Dave Campo and special teams
coach Joe Avezzano are expected to be safe. Jones has
given contracts to several assistants, but refuses to name
them. That’s one secret that has yet to be leaked.

Lions Reggie Brown
improving but never
will be 100 percent

despite his limitations.
After all, he’s lucky to be alive.
Brown, 23, returned home to Texas last week and is
recovering at the Texas Institute for Rehabilitation and
Research in Houston, where therapists Todd Novak and
Sherri Barash say he’s doing well.
The progress is coming so quickly, in fact, that he’s
expected to go home to Austin this weekend and will
continue outpatient rehabilitation there.
Still wearing the metal “halo” that helps to stabilize his
spine, Brown wasn’t satisfied with his first effort at
printing his name and date on a blackboard.
“I can do it better than that,” he said.
Brown then proceeded to do something he has done
hundreds or thousands of times for Lions fans: He signed

his autograph and jersey number, No. 59, on the board.
“I ’m real, real lucky; real, real blessed,” he said.
“People say it’s a tragedy that my career was cut so short,
but I ’m lucky to have had the opportunity just to play at
that level. It was great while it lasted.”
He said watching videotapes of the incident, especially
shots of his teammates and opposing players gathered in
prayer on the Silverdome field, also has helped him cope.
“When I see the tape, and see how guys were reacting,
it makes me feel special inside,” he said. “I just think I’m
really a tremendously blessed person.”
A day after his injury, Brown had surgery to fuse two
vertebrae in his neck. Doctors say that, despite his swift
recovery, he’ll never return 100 percent, and he’ll never
play football again.

HOUSTON (AP) — Only a few weeks ago, Reggie
Brown was a hard-hitting NFL linebacker. Now he tosses
a foam football with his physical therapist or jogs - very
carefully - just a few feet.
But Brown, who suffered a career-ending spinal cord
injury Dec. 21 during the Detroit Lions’ 13-10 victory
over the New York Jets, is grateful for what he can still do

Federov ready
to sit out
entire season
DETROIT (AP) — Restricted
free agent Sergei Fedorov says
he’s prepared to sit out the entire
season if that’s what it takes for
him to get the contract he wants.
“There’s been precedence —
back in the early or late ‘70s
when (former Montreal goalie)
Ken Dryden sat out one year, and,
boy, did he make the money,”
Fedorov told WJBK-TV in an
interview broadcast Monday. “I
can see myself doing that. Why
not? Because it’s not about
money. Because it’s about what I
believe in.”
The former MVP said it’s been
a long 3 1/2 months, but it’s
worth it for him to wait out his
bitter contract dispute with the
Detroit Red Wings.
“It seems to me it’s going to
take a little longer, I guess. That’s
fine,” he said.
The Russian center, a former
winner of the Hart and Selke
trophies, is a restricted free agent
reportedly seeking a $6 million a
year salary in a four-year
contract. The
Red Wings
reportedly have offered $5

million a year over four years.
“It seems to me it’s been 3 1/2
months gone without any
movement,” Fedorov said.
While his former teammates
have skated to a second-place
record so far in the NHL,
Fedorov has been practicing with
the Central Red Army Team in
Russia and at the Troy Sports
Center in Michigan.
“I still have a great passion for
this game, the game of hockey,”
he said. “That’s why I ’m still by
myself, still, after all that long
time ... still practicing by myself,
still feeling good about myself
and right about myself.”
Fedorov said last summer’s
limousine accident that injured
team
masseur
Sergei
Mnatsakanov
and
players
Vladimir Konstantinov and
Vyacheslav Fetisov has also
made it a difficult year for him.
As for Red Wings fans,
Fedorov said he appreciated their
support.
“I would say that the best
times here in Detroit will always
be behind me,” he said. “I know
quite a few people who’ve
wished me all the best, whatever
I do and whatever’s going to
happen. I ’d like to thank them so
much for their support.”

backs up Robert Traylor, had six

Smith, a 6-7 forward from
Amarillo, Texas, did not play
against the Spartans.
Both players were expected to
travel to Columbus, Ohio, for
Saturday’s game against Ohio
State.
“We are all very relieved and
thankful that there were no
serious injuries in what could
have been a tragic accident,”
Ellerbe said in a statement.
