Lori Arnold, (r), leads a tour group through the Peck Building
during Preview SIUE activities on Monday. An estimated 1,500
parents and potential students participated in PREVIEW SIUE.

Lights. C am era. A ction. O n Monday,
SIU E showcased an area it knows best,
SIU E . A n estim ated 1,500 parents and
potential students took part in Preview
SIU E, the university's annual open house.
Pamela Voss, coordinator of Academic
M arketing Services and coo rd in ato r of
Preview SIU E, said she was pleased with this
year’s outcome.
“This year it went really sm ooth,” Voss
said. “I was glad how things flowed. We had
two early bird tours before the day really
started. It helped serve the people quickly.”
T h e e a r l i e r t o u r s w e re g i v e n a t
8 : 3 0 a n d 9 a.m .
Voss said th at the day w ent m ore
smoothly due to student volunteer workers
who primarily conducted the campus tours.
The organization Students Assisting in
Recruiting provided 22 student volunteers to
help Preview SIUE.
“Preview SIU E was their big day to show
off the cam pus,” E d C hilds, adm ission
counselor tour guide, said.
The tours for Tow er Lake and the
Residence Hall were also successful.

“There were 30 tickets per tour and the
Tow er Lake to u r sold o u t,” Suzanne
K utterer-Siburt, assistant d irector of the
Kimmel
L ead ersh ip
C enter,
said.
“ Residence Hall tours have been very full.
People have visited Tower Lake m ore this
year than any o th e r y e a r.”
Lisa M cKirgan, m arketing coordinator
for University Housing, said she also saw a
dram atic increase in tour attendance.
“It was totally surprising that so many
people wanted to see Tower Lake. Usually
people want to see the latest and greatest
(Residence Hall). We added an extra Tower
Lake tour,” McKirgan said.
“This year, a lot of people w anted to see
the in’s and out’s of the school,” KuttererSiburt said.
O ne m o th er and daughter, M ichele
M cHugh and Meghan M cHugh of G irard,
II., gave their opinion of.the university.
“ It was p retty good. I did wish the

think people could have picked up tickets
sooner,” Michele McHugh said, referring to
the long line for campus and Tower Lake

SIU President’s wife launches second
annual “Book in Every Home” campaign
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
For the second year in a row, Beverly
Sanders is asking SIU to help put a book in
the hands of children who otherw ise may
not have one.The university president’s
wife said last year’s drive was so successful
that people asked her if she was going to
do it again. “I had a wonderful team of
people helping m e,” Sanders said.
T he
second
“B ook
in
Every
H om e”campaign began the first week of
Novem ber and runs through the end of the
m onth. Sanders said she anticipates
surpassing her goal of collecting 2,500
books for preschoolers.
Last year, students, staff and faculty at
all SIU campuses donated m ore than 4,000
books. Enough, Sanders said, to establish
a lending library. This year should
be even better.
“1 do n ’t think it would m atter what we
asked for, w e’d get m ore than that.”

State and Local
Legislator proposes making adultery a felony
Nicaraguan woman who was raped
by Sandinista prison guards in 1981 suffered politically motivated
persecution and should have her request for political asylum
reconsidered, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. Melina LopezGalarza, daughter of a National Guard officer during the Somoza
dictatorship, was previously denied asylum by U.S. immigration
officials on the grounds that the Sandinistas no longer control
Nicaragua. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Board
of Immigration Appeals failed to take rape seriously enough as an
“atrocious form of punishm ent,” often causing long-term
psychological damage.

Greenpeace blocks U.S. shipment of soybeans
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — Two dozen Greenpeace activists
prevented a ship from unloading American soybeans Sunday as part of
the environmental group’s protest against U.S. exports of genetically
engineered food. Greenpeace said it believes soybeans genetically
altered to make them resistant to a popular weed killer were mixed
with other soybeans on the bulk carrier Bunga Saga Empat, which
docked at Ghent, 30 miles west of Brussels. The group wants
genetically engineered goods to be strictly separated from others to
allow consumers the choice of what they want to eat.

CHICAGO (AP) — State Rep. Sara Feigenholtz is stopping
short of asking adulterers to wear big scarlet ‘A’s’, but the
Chicago Democrat does want to make adultery a felony
punishable by one to three years in prison — and then have
convicted offenders register with the county clerk.
Lest you think Feigenholtz a prude, be aware that her
proposal is being offered to make a point. Steve Brown,
spokesman for Illinois House Minority Leader Michael
Madigan, said he knows what Feigenholtz was aiming for
when she proposed the amendment to Illinois’ adultery
law Thursday.
Feigenholtz, whose North Side Chicago district includes a
well-established gay community, was disgusted by recent
public reaction against same-sex marriage, Brown said.
“It was a little tongue-in-cheek and a little righteous
indignation,” Brown said. “I think this was Sara’s way oi
saying, ‘If you think that you can legislate one type of
morality — one type of relationship — let’s look at this one
that’s on the books.”’
Illinois does have a law making adultery a misdemeanor
punishable by no more than a year in prison, but it’s an

letter to the editor

RCM good for university’s image, bad for students
I am in terested in the subject o f student
preparation, persistence and retention. D uring the
past two years while attending Southern Illinois
U niversity at Edw ardsville, I have had am ple
opportunity to study this topic. I write this letter
today because the university is in the process of
im plem enting
a
new
accounting
concept
(Responsibility C enter M anagem ent, R CM ) that has
the potential to create less educational opportunity
for the citizens of Illinois.
This concept, by its very nature, will create fiscal
com petition betw een our schools and departm ents.
A group of students that cost m ore to educate will
not fare well under this new system unless their
needs and priorities are understood up front and
everyone agrees to these priorities. Students that
come from com m unities with poor property tax
bases have not had the opportunity to prepare as
well for college. This is not their fault and they have
just as much scholarly potential as students that
come from well funded school systems. A concerted
effort needs to be m ade to ensure that their needs
are m et within the RCM System.
This new system is being m andated by SIU
President Ted Sanders and the m odels being used
are from schools th at have higher entrance
requirem ents than SIU E. T herefore their students
do not cover as wide a range of preparation as our
students. This is an im portant difference to consider
w hen applying a business concept of financial
accounting to a university. O ur business school,
which has relatively high entrance standards, is
taking the lead in im plem enting this new program.
They do not see students until they get through the
general education requirem ents and by that time 30
to 50 percent of each new freshm an class has
dropped out. This lack of contact with under­
prepared students would not appear to give them the
needed exposure to address the needs and concerns
of undeclared and under-prepared students.
A pproxim ately 30 percent of our freshm an class,

each year, does not come back for a second year.
Many universities that are located close to urban
environm ents have a similar drop-out rate. Initially,
I thought that a good portion of this problem was
caused by institutional racism. A t the very root it
probably is, but there are other.causes more visible,
and paying attention to these other causes might
give us a way to significantly reduce this drop-out
rate. The people with pow er do not see this as a
problem because they are able to point to other
universities and say that the situation is normal. The
old adage that “the bigger the problem the less likely
it is to be considered a problem ” holds true here.
Those students that do not return cause very little
trouble for the adm inistration and they are relatively
easy to replace with new freshm en. So my
perception is that in the past most of the effort was
directed at keeping the num bers of students up, and
only surface efforts were m ade in trying to help
students with difficulties.
U nder C hancellor Nancy Belck this situation has
im proved. She has placed em phasis on student
retention, and others in power are following her
lead. With RCM, where decisions are based upon
each departm ent making money, it would be very
easy to go back to giving priority to those students
that are cheaper to educate, and under-prepared and
undeclared students would receive less priority.
State universities can lead the way and correct
some of the educational inequality that exists in our
society. O ur property tax based educational system
does not provide all citizens with equal access to
education. The state university is in a unique
position to address some of these problems. By
providing funds, reduced entrance requirem ents and
program s directed to help students who have been
victims of this system, more people would have an
opportunity for education.
This is a problem of economics. R ural agricultural
high schools have the same tax base problem as
urban centers. As long as people are looking out for

Which is right?
Student calls for input on various religious beliefs
This letter that I am writing about is basically a question to SIU E students. In T IM E magazine
there is an interesting article about the recent debates on the book of Genesis. While I was
reading this article it brought back a personal question of mine that puzzled me for a couple
years. I have never understood why or how there can be a variety of religions, who are part of
the Christian faith, but each one believing that their religion is the right one.
I’m not saying that everyone believes that their religion is right or the best, but I find it
interesting when som eone believes that I ’m going to hell because I’m not part of their religion.
For instance, I know one person who believes that all Catholics are going to hell. On the other hand, I
know a Catholic person who believes that anyone who is not Catholic will go to hell. These two people are
obviously very extreme, but I found that even more people possess these views.
I do n ’t know how other people have been brought up, but I was raised to treat people the way
I wanted to be treated. If som eone is Catholic, Baptist or whatever, th at’s fine with me. If
som eone wants to believe that I am going to hell, O.K. I feel that if a person respects others and
tries to be a nice person, then he or she will be fine.
I have just begun to study religions and plan to study them in school. I would appreciate any
input into my dilemma. W hether it is a similar story or a different point of view.
Please email me at: mhaym an@ siue.edu with your views.
Thanks,
Michael Hayman

their own communities, we will have students that
are unequally prepared for university level work.
The publicly funded state university is a point where
som e o f this dam age m ight be undone. By
considering all students as scholars, but scholars
unequally prepared, a system of support can be
designed to provide a way for u n der-prepared
students to come up to speed and com pete equally in
our classrooms. Funding of program s for undeclared
and under-prepared students should be identified as
a priority for state supported higher education. If we
cannot provide a w orkable funding system for our
feeder schools, then we must do what we can for
those students that struggle through our flawed
system and reach university level.
O ur university has already raised the entrance
requirem ents in an attem pt to reduce the drop-out
rate. Just think about this for a m inute. We under­
fund some of o ur high schools with a system that
creates inequality of education and then o u r state
funded universities raise entrance requirem ents and
create another barrier for those struggling to get an
education. This ideology, of reducing the drop-out
rate by improving the quality of the students allowed
in, is only designed to m ake the university look
better. It is not designed to provide equal education
to the citizens of the state.
U nder RCM this situation could get worse. We
may have to live with President Sanders’ directed
program , but we m ust work to ensure that all
students have an equitable chance of success. I am
asking the faculty, staff, adm inistration and students
to consider the above when m aking decisions during
the im plem entation of RCM , and any o th er program
that would limit the opportunity of under-prepared
and undeclared students.

CO LU M B U S, O hio (A P) — The panel that
oversees higher education in Ohio is expected
this week to approve a plan that would m ake
public colleges eligible for additional state
money based on perform ance.
The plan would add $113 million to a twoyear higher education budget of m ore than $4
billion, R egent Vice C hancellor M atthew
Filipic said Friday.
Most of the state money a school receives
would continue to be based on enrollm ent,
but Filipic said attaching some of that money
to perform ance is an im po rtan t step in
changing the way O hio pays for higher
education.
“Even at the levels being proposed, the
ability to have a few percent at the margin
directed for specific goals can, in fact, affect
behavior,” he said.
Filipic said the incentive program would
“provide critical resources to campuses in
areas that are underfunded.”
Regents are to vote on the plan Friday. It
then would go to Gov. G eorge Voinovich,
who would consider it for inclusion in the
1998-99 state budget.
Voinovich asked the regents to study
perform ance-based financing for higher
education. Some perform ance criteria would
include holding down tuition rate increases,
graduating m ore underprivileged students
and helping nearby communities.

Regent C hancellor Elaine H airston said
the p ercentage of state m oney tied to
perform ance will increase in future budgets if
the plan works.
“These dollars are, in my view, likely to
grow significantly over tim e,” H airston said.
“ I t ’s opening the d o o r for longer-term ,
significant types of changes.”
A similar idea was rejected two years ago.
T he b o ard believes the plan now has
widespread support am ong leaders of Ohio
colleges.
H airston said obtaining early input from
the colleges was the key to reaching an
agreem ent.
U nder the plan, two-year colleges that
keep annual tuition increases at 2.5 percent or
less would be eligible for a share of $31
million.
In addition, four-year schools would agree
to keep tuition increases at a maximum of 5.5
percent — lower than the current state cap of
6 percent — if the Legislature agrees to make
up some of the funding slack.
Colleges would get additional money for

school districts, im proving th eir use of

Cut in grants ends prison college programs
LA G R A N G E , Ky. (A P)—This time of year,
the sight of inm ates cramming for quarterly
exams was com m on at the E astern Kentucky
C orrectional Com plex (EK C C ) near West
Liberty.
They studied in their cells, during dinner,
even during breaks from their prison jobs.
There were m ore than a hundred inmates,
poring over English, sociology or algebra.
“Some would work all day and then go to
class every night, and then study after that.
Some would study all day. Some would study
w henever they could,” warden Michael O ’D ea
said.
“The classes in here were the first time I
ever took education seriously,” M ark Wilson,
29, of Pike County, said. H e is serving a 20year sentence for assault and burglary.
“Sometimes I would study for 10 hours. The
day was one big study hall.”
But this year, there are no books, no tests,
and especially, no classes.
C ongress banned inm ates from getting
federal Pell grants for college in 1995. The
state moved shortly thereafter to cut off state
grants, fearing a flood of applications.
E arlier this year the G eneral Assembly
p a s s e d ' a law prohibiting inm ates from
receiving state education grants for p o o r
students until all other requests from eligible
students had been met.
Paul B orden, director of the K entucky
H igher Education Assistance Authority, said
18,000 students seeking state College Access
Program grants were turned away for the 199697 school year.
“ A lot of additional funds would have to
com e through for (inm ates) to be eligible,”
B orden said.
As a result, the num ber of inmates taking
college courses at the 12 state-run prisons has
dropped from a high of 799 in the 1993-94
school year to 25 this year. Twenty of those
atten d classes at the L u th er L uckett
. C orrectional Complex near La Grange. The
rest are taking correspondence courses.
“T he college program s at prisons are
effectively e n d e d ,” W endell M cC ourt,

ed u catio n p rogram ad m in istrato r for the
state, said.
A bout 150 inm ates at EK C C were enrolled
in college classes in the 1994-95 school year.
Classes were held at the prison and the colleges
provided
instructors
to
teach
about
14 offerings.
T hat year, five inm ates graduated with
b ac h elo r’s degrees and 28 with tw o-year
associate’s degrees, O ’D ea said. A nother 30
inm ates who were just a few hours shy of a
degree were left out in the cold when the
grants were taken away, he said.
Wilson said the prison supported the college
students.
“The warden would try to give the (student)
inm ates private cells, so they could study
whenever, or he moved people around so those
in the program could room together,” Wilson
said. “They let us form study groups to m eet
w henever we needed. The support m eant
a lot.”
O pponents of the program object to tax
dollars being used to finance in m ates’
educations while law-abiding college students
are turned away. Proponents play up statistics
that show inm ates who earn degrees while in
prison almost never return.
Caught in the m iddle are inmates like Mike
Smith, a 22-year-old college student when he
was convicted of first- and second-degree
assault. Smith is now taking two courses at
Luther Luckett.
“W e’re all going to be released some day,”
he said. “T hese guys are going to be
som ebody’s neighbor. W ouldn’t you rather
your neighbor have a degree and be able to get
a good jo b ?”
Wilson, who had finished three semesters
toward an associate’s degree, rejects the notion
that funding should be withheld from inmates.
“If th at’s the argum ent, then why give us
any rehabilitation,” he said. “Take away some
m enial jobs h ere and use th at m oney to
educate us. How many people who live prison
w ith a b ac h elo r’s degree com e back, as
opposed to som eone who spent the tim e
working in the laundry?”

University of Ya. to spend private funds
to boost its faculty members’ salaries
C H A R L O T T E S V IL L E , Va.
(A P) — The University of
Virginia (U.Va.) will spend
about $9 million in private
funds over the next three
years to increase faculty
salaries.
The raises are an attem pt
to stem what officials say is
plum meting m orale and the
loss of talented professors.
The university’s B oard of
Visitors on Friday tentatively
approved the m ove, which
U.Va. P resid en t John T.

said
is
unprecedented for a public
institution in Virginia.
“We will be dealing with a
very different university in
two years” if nothing is done,
Casteen told the board.
C asteen ’s an n ouncem ent
came the same afternoon that
a group of hourly em ployees
protested a plan to delay state
w orkers’ pay checks, saying
they always bear the brunt of
budget cuts.
U.Va. faculty m em bers

states. In April, an internally

Follow ing sharp cuts in

under form er Gov. L. Douglas
W ilder in the late 1980s,
law m akers recently have
started
to
address
the
problem . This year, Virginia
college professors will receive
raises of betw een 4 percent
and 6 percent in the first of a
four-year plan to m ake the
state m ore com petitive in the
academic job market.
But C asteen said the state’s
efforts will not be enough to
keep its flagship institution
com petitive with the best
schools in the country.
In a survey last year by the
A ssociation of A m erican
Universities, U.Va.’s average
faculty salary of $63,700

18th in 1989 before state
budget cuts took their toll.
U.Va. officials say their
plan will boost the university
back to its previous level.
“A class university has got

to pay salaries,” U.Va. R ector
Hovey S. D abney said.
Using
unrestricted

donations, the university
plans to boost salaries 6
percent during the next three
years, above increases given
by the state. The increases
would be m erit based and
affect all university schools
except the graduate, law,
business and medical schools,
which have had th eir own
mechanisms for keeping pace
in the salary m arket, officials
said.
Leonard W. Sandridge Jr.,
U .V a.’s
executive
vice
president and chief financial
officer, said the first of the
increases would take effect
Dec. 1 and would average
betw een 1 percent and
2
percent.
Over the next three years,
Sandridge estim ated, U.Va.
would spend $1.5 million, $3
million and $4.5 million to
achieve its salary goals. A fter
that, the university would be
com m itted to coming up with
$4.5 million in private money
each
year
to
m aintain

Christmas tree growers face unusually good season
STARKVILLE, Miss. (A P) — Mississippi
Christmas trees have thrived under unusually
good growing conditions this year, and the
trees are ready to be harvested by spirited
holiday enthusiasts.
S tephen
D icke, extension
forestry
specialist in Raym ond, said Mississippi’s trees
have w eath ered well this year and are
looking good. G row ers are facing only a few
problems, such as needlecast, in some areas
of the state.
Starkville grow er Jeffrey K rans said
needlecast is a disease that causes needles to

fall out and affects tree density. Needlecast is
a problem for the Virginia pines every year,
but this year’s dry autum n helped lessen the
severity of the disease.
Mississippi’s production of Christmas trees
has slowly crept up in the past few years. An
estim ated 250,000 trees were produced in the
state this year.
“T he econom ic forecast for Christm as
trees looks good, and a high dem and has
been projected,” Dicke said. “The last couple
of years have been good for Christmas tree
growers, and this year is expected to yield
another good crop.”

and your son is kidnapped. How do
you get him back?
The answer to this has to come from
Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson ) and his
wife, K atherine (Rene Russo) in the
Nov. 8 release of the film, Ransom.
In the film, the M ullen’s son is taken
from them and they desperately want
him back alive. H ow ever, the
k id n ap p ers have d ifferen t plans
in mind.
The kidnappers are led by Jimmy,
(Gary Sinise) a not-so-innocent plain
clothes cop, with o ther talents such as
Lily Taylor and D onnie Wahlberg
(Yes, one of the “New Kids” got a job).
While the kidnappers have their
inner struggles, Tom and K atherine
have struggles with them selves and the
FB I headed by A gent Lonny Hawkins
(Delroy Lindo). T here is some tension
betw een every character throughout
the entire film.
R o n H ow ard directs the actors
through intense em otion and personal
dram a for many of the characters. In
this way, he unm istakably draws us
into his work.
O ne of the com plaints I have with
the film is th at H ow ard leaves some of
the characters short of purpose.
I feel that the true talent of Taylor
and Lindo was not seen and their
characters, if developed m ore in the
plot, could have been m ore interesting.
B esides those m inute criticisms, I
enjoyed the film.
The parallels in scenes betw een
parents and kidnappers was simply
amazing. They sparked up all of the
tension am ong each of the characters.
Mel Gibson portrays Tom very
well, and the relationship between his
son Sean, played by Brawley Nolte and
him self is very convincing.

“Even though we beat Bellarmine earlier in the season,
it’s going to be a tough game for us,” M ontgomery
said. “Ft. Wayne is a tough place to play in.”
The volleyball team would like to thank the fans,
including C hancellor Nancy Belck, for coming out to
support them this past weekend.
The Cougars ended their regular season play with
22 victories and 15 losses overall and a conference
m ark of 12-4.

It's time for Winter...
...And that means basketball.
The SIUE men's basketball team kicked off
their season with an exhibition game against
Team Reebok Monday night. The game was
still in progress when the paper went to print.
The women's team has also played an exhibi­
tion game preparing for their regular season
opener against McKendree. A full preview of
all the winter sports will be featured in the
Alestle Holiday Issue on Dec. 3rd. It will be
an in depth look at the teams potential for the
up-coming season.

Penalty kick douses Cougars
hopes in GLVC tournament
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E m en’s soccer team ended their season on
a sour note, losing their first round game in the G reat
Lakes Valley C onference Tournam ent.
Scoring was at a prem ium as the Cougars faced off
against Q uincy last W ednesday in Quincy, 111.
R egulation concluded in a 0-0 tie, but Quincy scored
on a penalty kick in the third overtim e to elim inate
SIU E from the tournam ent.
“ It’s disappointing to have our season end the way
it did,” head coach E d H uneke said.
The goal was filled with controversy, as the referee
called the foul which set up the penalty shot against
the Cougars on a battle for a loose ball.
“T here is an unw ritten rule that no referee call a
penalty kick in sudden death,” H uneke said. “I’m sur­

prised it was called, because it wasn’t even a goal-scor­
ing opportunity for Quincy.”
SIU E was w ithout the offensive fire-pow er of
D arren Snyder and Jerry Reed.
“Scoring becomes difficult when you’re without
your two big scorers,” H uneke said.
Despite the lack of scoring, S IU E ’s bench helped
the team to out-shoot Quincy 28-11.
H uneke credited the freshm en for their support in
the crucial game.
“We had a good run this season,” H uneke said. “We
m ade considerable advancem ent and received the
national respect that we deserved.”
H uneke said, “ I’m disappointed that we didn’t go as
far as we were expected, but we showed a lot of team
character throughout the whole season.”
The Cougars finished the year with an 11-7-1
overall record.
