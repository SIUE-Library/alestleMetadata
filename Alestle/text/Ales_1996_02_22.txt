An alternative way to spend spring break
Working with the Loyal Shawnee Indian tribe will be how some are going to spend their vacation
By David Weil
News Reporter
Twenty .SIUE students and five staff members will be
participating in the Alternative Spring Break ServiceLearning Project.
The group will be traveling to Vinita and White Oak, Okla.,
to work with and learn from the Loyal Shawnee Indian tribe.
While providing students with an opportunity to serve the
communities, the trip will also provide a rich learning
experience and enlightening cultural exchanges.
“Just sending someone out to do volunteer service doesn’t
always do much good,” said Suzanne Kutterer-Siburt from the
Kimmel Leadership Center. “It helps much more if students
actually learn something.”
Before leaving on the trip, students are required to attend
an orientation session designed to prepare them to adapt to
the new cultural environment they will be visiting.
Discussions will be headed by Dr. Margaret Brown, a
French Colonial Archeologist, and Evelyne Voelker, Director
of the American Indian Center Mid-America, in addition to
Dale Besse, an American Indian Cultural Specialist.
By participating in the orientation, students will be taught
how to act in the Indian culture so as to respect their hosts
upon arrival.
For example, as Kutterer-Siburt said, “If you are offered

food, you must accept it.”
By learning the customs of the Indian people, students will
be able to interact more closely with the new people they will
meet.
The trip is part of an ongoing attempt by the Kimmel
Leadership Center to provide students with opportunities to
grow while providing volunteer services and developing
leadership qualities.
“It’s more than the volunteerism and the leadership
component. It’s opening their eyes to the world and
broadening their horizons,” said Kutterer-Siburt.
The students will participate in a variety of activities
including construction and clean-up work at the Tribal
Headquarters and ceremonial stomping grounds.
In addition, they will be assisting the Cherokee Headstart
staff with ongoing programs and a mural.
Besides working, students will get the opportunity to
experience Indian culture first hand when the Loyal Shawnee
tribe members prepare traditional meals for them.
Also, the tribe will give lessons in tribal history, storytelling,
governmental issues and stomp dancing.
In addition to visiting the Loyal Shawnee tribe, students
will also have the opportunity to visit the George Washington
National Monument and to visit the Precious Moments

Judge upholds Menendez
ruling
•O n Tuesday, the judge in
the murder trial of Erik and
Lyle Menendez upheld his
previous ruling that, in
effect, barred the jury from
returning
manslaughter
verdicts in the shotgun death
of their mother. The two
brothers said they shot their
parents but it was out of fear.

Buchanan takes N.H.
•Pat Buchanan won the New
Hampshire primary on Tuesday,
damaging Sen. Bob Dole’s
presidential hopes and plunging
the race for the Republican
nomination into confusion.
Buchanan, the conservative
commentator, marshaled an
alliance
of
religious
conservatives and worried
workers to forge his way to
victory.

Students
and
faculty
were
evacuated from the Peck Building
Monday morning due to a failure in
the heat exchange system used to heat
the water coming into the building.
The 350 degree water used in the
heat exchanger was mixed in with the
regular 150 degree water used in the
bathrooms and the result was the a
collection of steam and condensation
in the equipm ent room, Bob
W ashburn, director of Facilities
Management, said.
The steam became a danger due to
the amount of electrical equipment in
the room and the building had to be
shut down to prevent a short from
occurring, Washburn added.
“Since the electricity had to be shut
down, the building was evacuated.
Once the problem was corrected,

Collinsville man faces new charge
•Charges that a Collinsville man violated an order of protection were
upgraded to aggravated stalking on Friday.
Paul Ethridge, 27, of 317 Bissell S t., Apt. C, is accused of threatening his exwife, Michelle McCrary, 25, of 313 Hartmann St., between 6:30 and 6:44 p.m.
Feb. 15, at her home. Ethridge allegedly made obscene remarks, threatening
McCrary and indicating that he might shoot her.
The charges also state that Ethridge placed McCrary under surveillance on
Sept. 20,1995, Dec. 25,1995 and Feb. 15,1996. On Christmas night, Ethridge
put a box of childrens clothing on the front porch of McCrary’s home and told
her it was a bomb. The street had to be closed for several hours until a state
bomb squad could X-ray the box.

N a t io n a l---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Agency restricts passenger train speed
•Four days after a crash outside Washington that killed 11 people, the
Federal Railroad Administration issued emergency rules Tuesday, requiring
passenger trains to restrict their speed after leaving stations. The trains are to
travel at no more than 30 mph until they receive an all-clear signal.
In addition, engineers will have to call out red or yellow signals to another
crew member, and railroads must ensure that emergency exits are clearly
marked and working.
The accident happened Friday evening after a Maryland Rail Commuter
train passed a signal that was supposed to be yellow, requiring the train to limit
its speed to 30 mph. The train then stopped at a station in Kensington, Md.,
but when it left the station, it speeded up to 63 mph.

letter to the editor

Thanks to those who helped with Residence Hall Family Weekend
I would like to thank everyone who participated
in and worked on the 2nd Annual Student
Residence Hall Family Weekend, held on Feb. 9-11.
The weekend, designed to strengthen campus
community by developing bonds between the family
members of students and SIUE, was full of fun and
surprises. Approximately 225 family members
participated during the weekend, representing about
70 families.
Many family members started off the weekend
right by enjoying bowling and billiards in the
University Center Recreation Center. Thanks to
Tom May, manager of the Recreation Center, for his
cooperation in organizing this activity. The Friday
evening Talent Show was a huge success, thanks to
the creative singers, musicians, poets, lip-synchers
and human pretzel who performed. Special thanks
go to Alix-Ann Rowland and Michelle Callender of
the Residence Hall Programming Committee
(RHPC) for putting a great show together and
keeping it going.
Over 130 people toured the Student Residence
Hall and Tower Lake Apartments on Saturday after

the morning’s complimentary brunch. Many students
and parents were interested in touring the place
many students will choose to live during the next
academic year. In the afternoon, Jennifer Durbin of
the Kimmel Leadership Center took a group of
family members to St. Louis on a bus trip sponsored
by RH PC and the University C enter Program
Board. Other families just enjoyed being with their
students in the Edwardsville area. Saturday evening
brought an excellent buffet dinner with Chancellor
Belck and Vice-Chancellor Emmanuel and a trip
over to the Vadalabene Center to see the SIUE
Cougars work over the Wisconsin-Parkside Rangers.
At half-time of the men’s game, Joseph and Linda
Garcia, parents of JoAnn Garcia, were named
“Family of the Weekend.” JoA nn’s essay on how her
family has been supportive of her and her decision to
attend SIUE won the “Family of the Weekend”
contest.
The Garcia’s were awarded a beautiful plaque by
Chancellor Belck at center court. The family was
then honored at a special half-time reception
sponsored by Cougar Athletics (who also supplied

letter to the editor______________________

all of the Family W eekend visitors with
complimentary admission to the m en’s and women’s
games). Special thanks here to Brad Hewitt, who
made the complimentary admission, half-time
reception and special “Family W eekend”
announcements during the game possible.
As the Sunday morning brunch was served in the
UC, many of the families said good-bye to each
other and laughed together about the fun they had
over the weekend. It WAS a fun weekend, especially
seeing the students and their families enjoying just
being together.
Thanks also go to: Tom Hartigan, Nona Cooper,
and Shirley Lodes of Dining Services; the Alestle
staff for the article on the Talent Show; the Resident
Assistants of the Student Residence Hall; staffs of
University Housing Facilities Management and the
Student Residence Hall; and especially Chancellor
Nancy Belck and Vice-Chancellor for Student
Affairs Narbeth Emmanuel for supporting what we
hope will become an SIUE tradition.

letter to the editor-----------------------------------

It's time for the students to pay up Someone needs to stand
Much of the space in the open letter from the
Student
Governm ent,
Personnel/Public
Relations Board (Alestle, 2/20/96) was devoted
to convincing those students who had
perpetrated telephone fraud that SIUE had the
means to track down and prosecute them if they
chose not to turn themselves in.
While I applaud this group for encouraging
students to “fess up” or face the consequences of
telephone fraud, I object to the pleading tone in
the letter as well as to the statement, “True, we
agree the school was at fault for letting this
process to drag on unnoticed ...”
I guess the university may be at fault for
overlooking the possibility that there’s a little
larceny in all of us—even SIU E students.
However, the real fault on the part of the

university has been in attempting to cut a deal
with the phone company, and in allowing
students so much time to come forth, admit their
guilt, and pay their bills. The employees
responsible for letting this m atter slip through
the cracks have paid the price; they have been
fired or forced to resign. It is time for the
students who decided to defraud the university to
pay up.
In addition to appealing to students’ fear of
getting caught, how about appealing to their
sense of ethics? Pay up because it is the right
thing to do. Or am I completely out of touch by
even suggesting this?

up for the Muppets

I am writing in regards to the review of Muppet
Treasure Island that ran in the Feb. 20 edition of the
Alestle.
A good review; however, the statement “This Disney
movie adds to the list of previous Muppet movies—that
line-up beginning with Muppets Take Manhattan, a
classic which introduced us to (the M uppets)” is
incorrect.
Muppets Take Manhattan came out in 1984, I believe,
and was the third movie in the Muppet series. The
Muppet Movie came out in 1979, and their first sequel,
The Great Muppet Caper, came out in 1981. The fourth
movie, A Muppet Christmas Carol, came out a few years
ago.
Minor points to be sure, but who else is going to stand
up for frogs, pigs, chickens, and whatever?

Past Kimmel Leadership Center activities have included the Urban Plunge, where students
were sent to inner city areas to learn about the residents and provide volunteer labor.
Student interest in the Alternative Spring Break Service-Learning Program has soared and
Kutterer-Siburt hopes to see the program expand in the future.
“Because of the demand for this trip, we are working with a number of professors in order to
have more than one trip next spring,” she said.
The trip is being sponsored by the Student Leadership Development Program, the United

students were allowed back into the building,” Washburn said.
Another problem, however, arose during the shutdown. According to Washburn, anytime a
loss of water occurs in a building for any reason, the water has to be declared non-drinkable,
and a sample of the water must be sent to a state health lab for testing for 24 hours.
The Peck Building’s water fountains had to be shut off as a result of the problem, and
coolers of water temporarily replaced the fountains.
The tests were returned to Facilities Management Tuesday afternoon, and the water
fountains returned to working order Tuesday afternoon.

Wisconsin Public Service Commission sues Ameritech
MADISON, Wis. (AP)—The state Public Service
Commission sued Ameritech, Wisconsin’s largest local
phone operator, seeking forfeitures for what the agency
claims was poor service to thousands of customers last
year.
The PSC filed the civil action Monday in Dane
County Circuit Court after Ameritech failed to reach
agreement with the agency in efforts to settle the matter
out of court.
Cheryl Parrino, the chairwoman of the commission,
said it wanted a clear ruling on its authority to monitor
service in the telecommunications industry.
“There is a concern that we should have mechanisms
in place to deal with problems very quickly if problems

were to reoccur,” she said. “There isn’t an agreement
regarding the commission’s authority in the new
(telecommunications) state legislation.
“If we don’t have jurisdiction to deal with service
quality, now is the time to get it cleared up legislatively.”
Ameritech Wisconsin maintains that the intent of
the state telecommunications bill was for customers to
keep phone companies on their toes by defecting to
competitors if service deteriorates, its vice president of
regulatory affairs said.
“We are disappointed that the commission has
chosen a court process,” Barbara Ulichny said. “We
would have liked other means that are less expensive
and more efficient... We have- fixed the service
problems.

The phone company suggested last week that its
dispute with the PSC be resolved through mediation.
“We have been more than willing and anxious to
reach some kind of a voluntary agreement with the
PSC,” Ulichny said.
The PSC has contended that the time Ameritech
took to answer repair calls and restore service did not
reach state-imposed standards for a time last year.
Ameritech has since met the standards and refunded
money to affected customers.
Besides the forfeitures, the PSC is also seeking an
injunction preventing Ameritech from letting service
deteriorate in the future and requiring it to comply with
a new PSC monitoring program.

Ambulance Call
On Feb. 12, at 11:18 a.m., police
and ambulance responded to a call at
Health Service where a student had
eaten some food that caused her to
have
an
allergic
reaction.
Edwardsville Ambulance Service
transported the student to Anderson
Hospital.

On Feb. 15, at 7:57 p.m., police
investigated an accident at North
University Drive and Tower Lake
Road. Rodney Leggett, 25, of East
Alton, was stopped at the stop light.
Jennifer Hammons, 19, of East Alton,
was approaching Leggett’s vehicle
from behind when she slid on the ice,
striking Leggett’s car in the left rear
end. There were no tickets issued.
On Feb. 15, at 8:34 p.m., police
investigated an accident on North
Circle Drive and University Drive.
Angela Dettmers, 22, of East Alton,
was stopped at the stop sign when
Bart Smith, 26, of Edwardsville,
approaching from behind, slid on the
icy road and struck D ettm er’s car in
the left rear bumper area. There were
no tickets issued.

25 treated after student suffers meningitis
CLEMSON,
S.C.
(A P)—Clemson
University health officials have treated about
25 people with antibiotics after a student was
hospitalized with what is believed to be a
contagious and potentially fatal form of
meningitis.
Michael Jason Shannon, 19, of Chester was
being treated for meningococcal meningitis at
Oconee Memorial Hospital, said Dr. Stuart
Clarkson of the school’s Redfern Health
Clinic. Shannon was listed in fair condition
Monday.
Clemson officials said Shannon’s roommate
called an ambulance after it became clear that
the freshm an’s condition had worsened
Sunday.
A lab culture should confirm the meningitis
diagnosis, Clarkson said, but he doesn’t expect
the disease to spread.

As a precaution, about two dozen people—
from Shannon’s roommate to the emergency
workers who carried him from the dorm—
have been treated with a preventive medicine.
Meningitis is transm itted through the
exchange of saliva, o r through contact from
nose or throat secretions as with a sneeze or a
cough.
The disease attacks tissues surrounding the
brain or spinal cord and can cause a coma,
sudden shock and death. Symptoms include
severe headaches, nausea, stiff neck, fever or
even a low temperature.
This is Clemson’s second meningitis case in
a month. A commuter student living in Seneca
has since recovered.
School health officials said the two cases
were not connected.

SUNY official behind “Black List” incident re-instated
O NEONTA,
N.Y.
(A P)—The
college
administrator who gave a list of black male students
at the State University at O neonta to police
investigating a burglary has been reinstated to his
former position.
The Students of Color Coalition, angry at Leif
H artm ark’s reinstatem ent, were planning an
education week at the end of this month to show that
the negative impact of the 1992 incident continues.
“This isn’t just a students’ problem,” said Roberta
Caban, a junior. “It’s everyone’s problem.”
Meanwhile, today in Albany, the state’s highest
court said it would decide whether the state Court of
Claims should hear a case against SUNY and the
Oneonta campus’ administrators filed by students
whose names were given to police. The Court of
Claims has declined to hear the case, saying it didn’t
have jurisdiction.

Hartmark was reinstated as vice president for
administration and finance after spending three
years as director of administration and finance.
On Sept. 4, 1992, as acting president, Hartmark
complied with a state police request for a list of black
male students. Police were investigating a burglary
involving a 77-year-old white woman who claimed
her assailant was a black male.
About 300 black male students and residents of
Oneonta were interrogated by police.
Blacks branded the investigation as racist. Two
civil rights lawsuits were filed against the state, city
and various college and police officials.
Oneonta President Alan B. Donovan demoted
Hartmark and placed Him on unpaid leave, which
amounted to a fine of about $7,000. Donovan and
state police also apologized.
Since then, H artm ark’s performance has been
reviewed and reinstatem ent was appropriate,

Donovan told The Daily Star of Oneonta last week.
As vice president, Hartmark isn’t in the chain of
command to oversee the college in the president’s
absence, Donovan said. The change is Hartm ark’s
title carries no increase in pay or change in duties.
H artm ark earns $101,580 as the college’s chief
financial officer.
Donovan made the decision in a Dec. 14 memo to
the dean, directors and department heads. Students
met with him last Wednesday to protest the action.
The students said Hartm ark’s demotion and fine
weren’t penalty enough, and they felt betrayed that
he was reinstated and that students weren’t told
directly.
“Was this a sensitive way to handle this situation?
Obviously not,” Caban said. Students weren’t meant
to know about H artm ark’s reinstatement, she said.
“As students we don’t have a lot of power as it is,
and even less as students of color,” Caban said. “We
don’t have any political power.”

Burglar steals chips from computers at university Madonna U. to offer
PITTSBURGH (AP)—The man who stole
com puter chips from a Carnegie Mellon
University lab was cunning enough to hide in a
trapdoor until the center closed, but left behind a
screwdriver and fingerprints that police hope will
identify the thief.
Chips were believed to have been removed
from 64 of the center’s 90 computers.
Campus police almost caught the culprit, and
witnesses could identify him if they saw him
again, said Jim La Paglia, chief of campus police.
Workers saw the man dart out of one door to the
computer as they opened a second door to clean
the room at about 3 a.m. on Saturday.
“He had a 20-yard start,” La Paglia said. “He
was chased out of Wean Hall and into Porter Hall
on Frew Street.”
The thief is believed to be a student because he

wasn’t wearing a coat and knew the campus well
enough to flee into Porter Hall during the chase.
Technicians normally use the trapdoor to get
under the computers for repair work.
The thief left behind a screwdriver, La Paglia
said. Police checked the computers for
fingerprints and found hair and fiber samples
they plan to use to try to identify the man.
LaPaglia said about $200,000 worth of
com puter equipm ent was stolen from the
university in 12 incidents from July to December
last year. He did not know how much the chips
stolen Saturday were worth.
Chips, used to store and process information,
vary in price from $50 to thousands of dollars.
Carnegie Mellon has surveyed 75 universities
nationwide in an attempt to assess the size of the
problem. Only 25 schools responded, but 17 of
those schools reported a total of 81 thefts.

hospice care master’s
LIVONIA, Mich. (AP)—Madonna University, the first
school to offer a bachelor’s degree in care of the terminally
ill, plans to offer a master’s degree program in hospice care.
Thirty people have signed up for the program, which will
be offered in the fall.
“I would be astonished if another school (now has) even
a major, let alone a degree program in hospice,” said
Madalon Amenta, executive director for Hospice Nurses
Association, the largest professional hospice group in the
country. “It vaults both volunteers and professionals into a
higher status.”
Sister Mary Cecilia Eagen, a hospice expert who crafted
Madonna’s master’s curriculum, said the program is needed
because hospice care and hospital care may be at odds in
their goals.
Hospice care is centered on family and friends
surrounding the terminally ill person. Emphasis is also
placed on counseling, she said.

Students study cultural and ethnic differences
PINE BLUFF, A rk. (A P)—Students from the University of A rkansas at Pine Bluff are
learning about cultural and ethnic differences through a program its developer says will
help prepare them for a global economy.
Jacquelyn M cCray m odeled the tw o-year M ulticultural L eadership D evelopm ent
program after a Kellogg Foundation program for m iddle-level m anagem ent in the
Cooperative Extension Service.
She got the idea while visiting h er sister, Linda W illiams-W illis, an assistant
adm inistrator for family consum er science at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, and
a friend, M argaret Weber, an associate dean for research and graduate program s in the
College of Hum an and E nvironm ental Sciences at O klahom a State University.
McCray said she w anted to prepare college students to work in a global economy and
develop good citizenship along the way. Because she is acting dean and director for the
School of A griculture and Hom e Econom ics, she wrote the grant for students in that
school.
McCray said she wants the students to understand that “different doesn’t necessarily
mean wrong, different is just different.”
The students have learned to express them selves, and they’ve learned to be careful about
how they comm unicate with others, M cCray said.
“I have seen the students grow in a num ber of ways,” she added.
UAPB and Oklahom a State students traveled to San A ntonio recently and stayed with
Hispanic families.
Alvin Peer, a junior from M arianna and Chicago, said he’s learning to com pare “how we
as people now contribute to each o th e r’s goals and accom plishm ents.”
Peer said students have to be open-m inded and adaptable to participate in the program.
“We are all selfish” to a degree, he said.
Travis D onald, a sophom ore from D erm ott, said the program helps everyone get a better
understanding of each o th e r’s culture and background and appreciate the differences.
Donald said he “realizes that others look at my differences like I do theirs. If we work
together, we can all go forw ard.”
The San A ntonio trip left a lasting im pression on him, he said. His host family treated
him well. “They opened their house and didn’t hold back, and I didn’t hold back when I
walked into the house,” he said.
The first joint experience was a conference in Dallas where the students developed a
leadership philosophy, McCray said. The second conference was held in Oklahom a, where
they studied Native Am erican culture.

Kriss Kross bringing their style back
By Darryl Howlett
Lifestyle Editor
Rap Review
*** (out of four stars)

After two successful
CD’s, once again rap
duo Kris Kross is back
on the music scene
again with “Young, Rich
and Dangerous.” The
album was produced by
Jermaine Dupree.

Usually when a “kiddie act” goes
from child act to mature group too fast
the audience rejects them. Such was
the case of The Boys and Another Bad
Creation. However, Kris Kross
manages to escape this omen with
their third CD Rich, Young, and
Dangerous.
Daddy Mac and Mac Daddy (Chris
Kelly and Chris Terry) doesn’t change
their name and they don’t change their
style. The only difference from the 16
and 17 year olds who brought you
Totally Crossed Out and The Bomb is
they no longer talk about missing a
school bus, they rap about having the
house to party while the parents are
away.
Starting with “Some Cut U p” the
little rappers sound like seasoned
veterans of the rap industry as the
beats grooves and moves you. The
next hit is the current top-charter
“Tonight’s Tha Night” a song which
makes you wanna throw out the
parents and start a party. This is
probably the best cut on the album as

the lyrics, beats, and grooves has a
even-flow hit em where it hurts beat.
“Young, Rich, and Dangerous” was
mediocre and simply is an outlet for
Kris Kross to brag about their money.
On “Live and Die For Hip Hop,” the
duo gets assistance from Da Brat.
Here is the next hit that should hit the
airwaves. The background of the song
is no other than Regina Belle’s “Baby
Come To Me.” I thought no rapper
could pull off a rap with this song but
they did.
“Money, Power And Fame (Three
Thangs Thats Necessities)” needed not
to be touch. The problem comes that
for background music, Kriss Kross
chose L.L. Cool J ’s hit “I Need Love.”
Unfortunately, you don’t think about
their rap, you think about the old hit.
However, the remaining raps on the
CD will leave fans happy.
“M ackin’ A in’t Easy” and “Da
Streets Ain’t Right” give a personal
testimony of the life of the artists. As
in other previous albums the direction
of producer Jerm aine D upree is
strong. And so the duo who brought
you the hits “Jump, Jump,” “Warm-It
U p” and “I Miss The Bus,” are kids no
more. They have matured to give the
listener a worthwhile effort to please
all Kriss Kross fans.

Opus ‘96 set to open today at Metcalf Theater
By Jennifer Casey
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
Musical selections by Joe Cocker, Barbara Striesand and Laurie
Anderson, as well as the old standard “Amazing Grace” and upbeat,
lighthearted Jamaican traditional pieces will be featured at Opus '96,
SIU E’s annual student dance concert.
“Opus,” when translated, means “original work,” and original work is
exactly what is being performed. All of the thirteen dance numbers were
choreographed by SIUE undergrads, and the sound, lights and production
is all in the hands of students.
The program features an hour of modern dance interpretations with
one ballet movement included. Twenty-five students, not all of whom are
dance majors, will perform in the concert.
Beth Burkemper, a member of the dance troupe, voiced her
enthusiasm over this year’s show.
“In the past, it (the concert) has been kind of morbid, but this year
is different... it’s a really big deal,” Burkemper said. Concerned with the fact
that Opus is running at the same time as the mainstage performance of “The
Boys Next Door,” Burkemper encouraged audiences to make time to see
both shows instead of choosing just one.
Opus '96 will be performed in the Metcalf theater and runs on
Thursday-Saturday, Feb. 22-24, at 7:30 pm and on Sunday, Feb. 25, at 2:00
pm. Admission is $2 and can be taken care of at the door or reserved by
calling the SIUE Fine Arts Box Office at 692-2774.

Clockwise: Jamell Brown, Paul Bailey, and Beth Burkemper of
Opus '96 playing Feb. 22-25 at the Metcalf Student Theater.

Commentary

It is not the color as much as it is
By Tonii
how you are wearing it. Select
tonal shades over matched
shades, for instance. The lightest
shade should be closest to the skin. Then, as
you layer, with a blazer for example, deepen
the shade. Perhaps, your problem is that you
are dressing in a pastel color from head-to-toe,
which will cause you to “pale” in comparison
with the clothing. Another tip would be to
select deep, rich colors instead of pastels (such
as periwinkle instead of sky blue) and accent
with bright colored accessories like a scarf.

My teenage daughter teases me for wearing
vests. She says they are outdated. Is that true?
Not at all. Although the cut has switched from
the V-Point to the straight cut, vest are still in
style. High-button vests are quite stylish,
especially when worn with a banded or
notched color, white shirt. The hip-length vest
over trousers or a slim skirt adds the savvy look
of a suit without the use of a restrictive jacket.

When can / wear white shoes again?
Of course you can wear your white shoes
whenever you want. However, if you want to
be fashionably correct, you will wait until after
Memorial Day.

Are french-cuffed shirts fashionable for men?
Yes, they are. The male models in G.Q.

Can make-up go bad?

I think they have. Todd Oldham designs the
most beautiful strappy lace-up shoe. Although
the typical Mary Janes with the fat heel are
stylish, the Grown-Up Mary Janes by Prada are
sleeker and have a narrow heel to add a little
sex appeal. A personal favorite of mine is the
Soaring Classic Pump by Manolo Blahnik. I
suppose that these days you have to pay
attention to designer’s style. Some focus on
casual shoes, while others will specialize in that
“sexy” look. In addition to the ones I have
named, Norma Kamah and Cynthia Rowley by
Zeitgeist have a nice line of sexy shoes.

personally think that the french
cuffs are a nice, new addition to
the male wardrobe, especially
when worn with a dark,
straight, high-buttoned, tailored
french cuffs shirts (such as the
ones worn by the Artist

Babyface) because they look
too feminine.

If your make-up smells, separates, changes
consistency or looks dirty, then you should
throw it away. Foundation or base usually
should be replaced after six months. However,
you can prolong the life of your foundation by
keeping it in the refrigerator. Powder products
such as pressed powder, blusher and eye
shadow can last a long time if you keep the
brushes and applicators fresh. Pencils will
never go bad as long as you keep them
sharpened. Mascara should be changed every
other month—whether you’ve used it all or
not—to prevent eye infections, especially if you
wear contact lenses.

NEW YORK (AP) _ Julia Roberts says it’s a
brave man who dares to ask for a date.
"Nobody ever asks me out. Ever. Almost never.
Almost absolutely never,” she told Entertainment
Weekly magazine. "Look, if you read the paper,
you figure I’m booked till, like, 2004. Like, why
would you even ask me? I’ve got so many balls in
the air, I can hardly stand up!”
One man who did ask was Matthew Perry of
"Friends.”
" I love being engaged in conversation with this
man, because he’s so terribly clever,” she said.
"W it is the key, I think, to anybody’s heart,
because who doesn’t like to laugh? Who? Show
me the person who doesn’t like to laugh and I’ll
show you a person with a toe tag.”

Snoop Doggy Dogg, Bodyguard
found innocent in fatal shooting
LOS ANGELES (AP) Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose best-selling rap albums portray the streetgang lifestyle of sex, drugs and violence, was acquitted of m urder Tuesday in the 1993 slaying
of a gang member. Snoop’s former bodyguard also was acquitted of murder.
The panel deadlocked on a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter against the two men and
an accessory-after-the-fact charge against Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Broadus.The jury
of seven men and five women were to resume deliberations Wednesday.
In returning the partial verdicts, jurors also acquitted Broadus, 24, and McKinley Lee, 25,-of
conspiracy to commit assault in the Aug. 25,1993, shooting death of,Philip Woldemariam, an
Ethiopian immigrant.
The rapper, whose first album “Doggystyle” hit No. 1 in sales just months after the shooting,
stared straight ahead as the court clerk read the verdicts.
Later, Broadus told MTV: “I feel very remorseful. But you know, I mean, God made the
decision. And he did what he did.
“We’re just gonna encourage everybody to just keep praying for us and supporting us,
fearlessly, and keeping our heads up high and realizing that everything’s everything.”
A fter the foreman said jurors couldn’t agree on the manslaughter charges in 15 ballots,
Superior Court Judge John Flynn ordered the panel to resume deliberations on those counts.
About an hour later, jurors went home for the evening with orders to return Wednesday.
Deputy District Attorney Ed Nison would not comment on the ongoing case.
Prosecutors claimed the two tracked Woldemariam down and shot him in cold blood at a city
park after the 20-year-old Woldemariam flashed a gang sign and shouted an obscenity in an
earlier confrontation outside Broadus’ apartment.
Defense lawyers called the shooting an act of self-defense, claiming Woldemariam was going
for a gun in the waistband of his pants when Lee fired at him from a Jeep driven by Broadus.
Prosecutor Robert Grace disputed the self- ____________ ^ ____________
defense claim, arguing in closing statements

by a combination of contradictory testimony and destroyed evidence.
Two of Woldemariam’s friends initially told police that Woldemariam was unarmed when he
was shot but later admitted hiding the weapon to set Broadus and Lee up for a murder charge.
Prosecutors also were unable to show jurors key evidence in the case such as the bloody

clothing Woldemariam wore. The clothing, along with a bullet and empty shell casing, were
destroyed by police in a mix-up prior to trial.
Defense lawyers called Woldemariam the aggressor in the dispute and argued that he was
not shot in the back but in the “lower left flank” as he turned away from the Jeep after
reaching for the gun.
Confident that prosecutors had failed to prove their case, the defense called only one witness
before resting. The man said he saw a black Chevrolet Blazer, not a Jeep, drive to an alley near
the park just before the shooting, and that a man _ not Lee _ walked down the alley with a gun.
Just months after the shooting, Broadus’ debut album “Doggystyle” hit No. 1 in sales in its
first week of release, making him one of the leading stars of so-called “gangsta” rap.
Though criticized for its offensive language and degrading references to women, the album
became one of the biggest sellers of 1994 with more than 4 million copies sold. Broadus
received the male artist of the year trophy in 1994 at the Billboard Music Awards.
Broadus isn’t the first rapper to run afoul of the law.
Tlipac Shakur was convicted of sexually abusing a fan in a New York City hotel room three
years ago and is currently free on $1.4 million bail pending an appeal.
Shakur, who attended Broadus’ trial last week to offer support, also was charged with
carrying a loaded weapon when he was stopped for speeding in Los Angeles in 1994.
Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, served a five-month work-release sentence for
violating probation on a 1993 assault that left a man with a broken jaw. Dr. Dre produced
Broadus’ album “Doggystyle.”
The case was the latest in a string of high-profile cases lost by Los Angeles County
prosecutors, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial, the Menendez brothers’ first murder trial
and the state trial of four officers accused in the beating of Rodney King.

Lady Cougars running on pride as season nears end
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor

Jerem y P aschall/A /est/e

The Lady Cougars' Amy Tuetken battles for the ball in a 91 -90 loss to USI.

The Lady Cougars are running on pride
going into their final four games of the
season against teams ahead of them in the
Great Lakes Valley Conference.
Needing to be one of the top six teams in
the region to make the playoffs, the Cougars,
9-7 in the conference and 14-8 overall, are
just trying to end the season on an up note.
They will start this with two games on the
road, then finish up the season with two
games at home.
“The best we can do is split with the teams
we have left to play since all of them have
beaten us once before. Even if we do win all
our games it isn’t going to matter too much
since they also have beaten us once,” head
coach Wendy Hedberg said. “It is kind of a
pride thing. We are trying to finish up strong
for next season.”
The first team on the list is Northern
Kentucky who beat the Cougars by two
points in the last outing. Hedberg feels things
will be different going into this contest.
“We didn’t play well last time. Right now
I think we are better prepared to stop them.

Wrestlers getting ready
for regional competition
By SIUE Sports Information
The success of thè SIUE wrestling team will be
determined as they travel to Northeast Missouri State
University for regional competition, Feb. 28-29.
“Regionals is when it counts, as long as we get it
together by then,” said Coach Larry Kristoff.
Injuries plagued the 3-7 Cougars during the first half of
the season, resulting in forfeits in several weight classes.
Now entering post season action, Kristoff is very
optimistic about their chances for the NCAA-11 National
Tournament. The champions in each weight class advance
automatically. Wrestlers also can advance to the NCAA-II
tournament held in Greeley, Co. on Friday-Saturday,
March 15-16, by earning a “wild card” berth.
In their most recent match, the Cougars faced the
University of Central Oklahoma, the No. 1 ranked team in
the nation. Coach KristofFs squad has healed up and have
been competing strong. Despite losing 24-13, the Cougars
made a strong showing against some of the top ranked
wrestlers in the nation.
Ri the 118-pound spot Chris McElwee, of Altus, Okla.,
defeated Keith Kizarr of Central Oklahoma, 9-7, who was
tanked No. 3 in the nation. For the season, McElwee is 14-

6,
Sophomore Brian Anderson, of Princeton, wrestled 126
pounds, losing 6-4 to Matt Goodson, who was ranked No.
8 in the nation. Anderson stands at 17-9 for the season.
At 134 pounds, Shawn Hickey, of St. Charles, defeated
Ryan Vratil, who was ranked No. 6 nationally. Hickey sat
out the first half of the season but came back strong in the
second half. During his first match back, the National
Dualsr Hickey pinned all five of his opponents. Hickey
stands at 9-4 for the season.
Jayson Querciagrossa, of Peoria , and William Glass, of
South Locust Grove, Okla. faced the top-ranked wrestlers
in their respective weight classes. Querciagrossa lost at
142 pounds, moving his record to 15-14. Glass lost at 150
pounds, bringing his record 10 12-11.
Kris Davis, of Port Byron, fills the Cougars 158 pound
spot. Davis lost to the No. 2 ranked wrestler, and now
stands at 4-18 before entering regional competition.
One of the Cougars’ toughest competitor fills the 167
pound spot. Jim Czajkowski, of Chicago, was unable to
compete with the team for the first half of the season, but
please see REGIONALS, next page

Jason Holmes makes his second trip this
year to the Cougar Com er for his spirited play last
Thursday against the University of Southern
Indiana.
It seems like the tougher the opponent is, the
better Jason plays.
“I hate losing,” Holmes said. “They’ve got
some good players, but I love playing USI. It’s my
home state and I’ve had some of my best games
against them.”
The good players of USI Holmes was talking
about are last year’s NCAA division II player of
the year Stan Gouard and Chad Gilbert, who has
been the GLVC player of the week four times this
season. Yet Holmes played right with Ihe big boys.
He was the game’s high scorer with 27 points and
the 6-foot-l guard also grabbed eight boards.
Holmes kept the Cougars close in the first half
with 12 points, but they weren’t enough as USI
went on a 19-4 run at the end of the half to take a
10-point lead at intermission.
“We had three charges during that span and
they made their free throws like a good team
should. That just kind of took the steam out of us,”
Holmes said.
Even though the Cougars are a modest 6-10 in
the GLVC, Jason sees this season as a building
block.
“This has been a good experience for us to learn
how to adapt to the new league. We’ll have a lot of
experienced players next year and that can only
help,” he said.
Congratulations Jason.

Personally, I think we let that one get away
from us early,” Hedberg said.
The tough game will come this Saturday
against Bellarmine who is tops in the
conference and ranked #1 in the region.
“They are playing real well. They are on a
14 or 15 game win streak and they will be
tough to beat,” Hedberg said.
Coming off the tough loss to third place
Southern Indiana 91-90 last Thursday, the
team just wants to get back out there and
play.
“It was a tough loss. We stressed before
the loss that we needed to play well in the
final five games since they were all teams
above us in the conference. After a loss like
that, the players just want to get back out on
the court and get back on track to end the
season strong,” Hedberg said. “But we have
nothing to lose and that should take a little
pressure off of us.”
The Cougars will finish up the season at
home against St. Joseph's and IUPU-Ft.
Wayne and, just like Northern Kentucky and
Bellarmine, they have already beaten them
once before.
“You can say all these teams are teams we
want to get back at,” Hedberg said. “That
should help us get ready for them.”

Terri Evans makes an encore appearance in
the Cougar Com er for her play against USI. Once
again, Evans was the Cougars leading scorer with
24 points.
The game was a shootout from the beginning
and Evans came out firing from downtown. On
three different occasions in the first 10 minutes,
Terri sank the three-ball from beyond the arc.
The last time the two squads battled, the
Cougars only lost by two so Evans said the team
was prepared.
“We felt confident before the game,” Evans
said. “We played them pretty well last time and we
knew we could play with them.”
The see-saw game went down to the wire.
Evans hit a jumper to put the Cougars up by one
with 1:20 left. Unfortunately, USI had an answer in
their pre-season All-American LeAnn Freeland,
who hit a shot from the baseline with 5.6 seconds
left.
USI then knew it would be up to Evans to work
some magic.
“I knew they’d be looking for me and when
they collapsed on me, I tried to dish it off,” Evans
said.
The Cougars just didn’t have enough time to get
off a shot.
Though the loss was tough to swallow, Terri did
see some positives.
“It gives us a boost because we know we can
play with them, and if we can play with them, we
can play with anybody. We just couldn’t execute
down the stretch,” she said.
Congratulations on being this week’s selection,
Terri.
