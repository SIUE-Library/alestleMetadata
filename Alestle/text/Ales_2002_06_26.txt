Former Cougar Chad Opel was signed by the Baltimore Orioles.

Southern Illinois University
Edwardsville Baseball shortstop
Chad Opel has been
signed by the Baltimore
Orioles as a free agent.
The Edwardsville native is
expected to join the Gulf Coast
Orioles in Sarasota, Fla. The
team plays in the G ulf Coast
League, which is comprised of
rookie ballplayers.
According to Opel, he is still
in awe.
“I was disappointed at first
when I didn’t get drafted, but if
you just rely on that, you get your

hopes up and then all of a sudden
when you’re not picked, you get
down,” Opel said in a recent
interview with The Telegraph of
Alton via telephone from
Sarasota, Fla.
“I didn’t want to do that. I
kept positive and hoped for the
best and here I am.”
However, Opel said now that
he has gotten his chance, he has
to run with it.
“They just ant to see what I
can do and how I can play,” Opel
said. “I just have to keep on being
a utility man and continue to
work my way in and hope things
work out.”

SIUE is sw itching from
Pepsi to Coke.
According
to
Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Narabeth Emmanuel, the switch
will become official July 1.
“Both Coke and Pepsi
provided strong bids for the
SIUE contract,” Emmanuel said.
“Pepsi edged out Coke in areas of
vending
com m issions,
the
opportunity to provide other
beverages, including Coke in

Union Station and the Commons
Grill.”
According
to
Morris
University Center Business
Manager Jim McDermott, with
the Pepsi-Cola contract SIUE
will have the ability to bring in
some competitive products.
“We will be able to bring in
five products o f our choice,”
M cDerm ott
said.
“In
all
likelihood it will be Coke, Diet
Coke and other products.”
Emmanuel said he feels the
nine-year contract with Pepsi has
a lot to offer SIUE.

“Attractions o f the contract
include marketing opportunities
for SIUE in Pepsi’s high school
calendar, the SIUE logo on
the Pepsi trucks and the support
for campus activities and
events,” Emmanuel said. "They
will help us with campus life by
giving us products and cash to
make improvements.”
Pepsi will also set up
vending m achines so students
can buy soft drinks with their
identification cards.

Nursing school receives grant

While state budget cuts are
putting a crunch on students’
wallets, SIUE has allocated more
than
$120,000
in
federal
scholarship money for trainees in
the master of nursing program.
The funding is part of $22
m illion
from the federal
governm ent to increase the
number of nurses with higher
degrees.
SIUE has been awarded
$50,000 for the Advanced
Education Nurse A nesthetist
Traineeship grant and $68,000
for the Advanced Education
Nurse Traineeship grant.
“They are for the student
directly,” School o f Nursing
Dean Felissa Lashley said.

“We’ve got about 25 students
who will be assisted.”
The yearly scholarship can
cover books, tuition and fees.
To receive the scholarship,
students must be in the m aster’s
degree program for anesthesia or
nurse practitioner. To graduate
from those areas o f study,
Lashley said it takes about 27
months for anesthetists and about
two years for a nurse practitioner
going to school full time.
“We’ve got approximately
500 students total,” Lashley said.
Nursing programs are offered at
Springfield, Fairfield, Effingham
and Carbondale through Southern
Illinois University.
“We’re looking into a
m aster’s program at Q uincy,”
Lashley said.
An existing facility will be

used for the program.
The federal funding for the
grants are through the U.S.
Departm ent o f Health and
Human
Services.
Acting
Associate Dean for Education
Services
Wendy
Nehring
gathered the information to apply
for the traineeship grant. There
are criteria the school must meet
to receive funding.
“We have to go through our
records to see how
many
students we have that meet that
criteria
(in
the
m aster’s
program ),”
N ehring
said.
Information concerning course
programs and the number of partand full-time students is also
included, and must be filed by
November.

WATER QUALITY REPORT - 2000
To: SIUE Students, Faculty and Staff
We are pleased to report that once again this year
University tap water met all United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) and Illinois drinking water
health standards. Your water system had no violations of
any maximum contaminant level and continues to be safe
and dependable. We did, however, have a technical
violation of the standards when we did not provide a copy
of the 1999 Water Quality Report to all water customers
by the July 1 reporting deadline last year.
The year 2000 Water Quality Report summarizes the
quality of water that we provided last year including
details about where your water comes from, what it
contains, and how it compares to standards set by
regulatory agencies.
We urge you to visit the Facilities Management website at
http://www.siue.edu/FACILITIES/ to view the complete
report. Click on Water Report 2000 in the Features folder.
A hard copy of this report also may be obtained by calling
650-2999 and asking for the 2000 Water Quality Report.
If you have any questions about this report or
concerning your water system, please contact Lee
Hoffmeier (650-3329) or Bob Washburn (6502999) at Facilities Management, Monday through
Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.

The civil defense and fire alarm systems will be
tested at 10 a.m. Tuesday, July 2.
The civil defense sirens, which emit a long,
wavering, intermittent siren, will sound for one to
two minutes. Then the fire alarms, the same as those
activated by building pull stations, will sound for 30

to 60 seconds.
No evacuation of the buildings is necessary.
These tests ensure that the systems are working
properly and also familiarize those at the university
with the sounds of the alarms.
If neither alarm can be heard, e-mail your
name, building address and phone num ber to
Facilities Management at fmserv@ siue.edu.

According to Emmanuel, SIUE will start off
with 12 to 16 machines able to handle identification
cards.
McDermott said another positive aspect of the
Pepsi machines is that they will all have Braille
instructions.
According to McDermott, Pepsi is practically
here.
“Pepsi is going to bring the machines on
campus this week,” McDermott said.
“On the weekend they will fill them and

Monday they will be accessible.”
Pepsi will also offer SIUE bottled Cougar
water.
“Every bottle of water that we sell here will
have a Cougar label on it,” McDermott said.
“A large number o f m etropolitan areas
surrounding us will be buying Cougar water.”
According to McDermott, the committee that
made the decision consisted of faculty, staff and
students.
The Coke contract expires Sunday.

NURSING-------------------from page 1

“We’ve received grants for several years,”
Nehring said.
The nursing field has been declining, but
Nehring looks to the funding to increase the interest

in the m aster’s program.
“We’re very happy to receive this funding, so
hopefully more students will want to get their
m aster’s degree,” Nehring said.

The St. Louis Cardinals
organization and the people
affiliated with it are not alone in
feeling a sense of emptiness a
week after the death of Jack
Buck. I never knew him or met
him, but like many others, I felt
close to him after listening to him
for so many years.
No one can argue how many
lives he touched when you
consider all the calls to radio
stations and the flow ers and
memorabilia left at his statue
outside Busch Stadium. This
outpouring
of
appreciation
proves that the St. Louis
Cardinals are more than a
baseball team to the people who
live in this area. They are a major
part of the culture of St. Louis
area and the
surrounding
communities. People feel a
connection with the team and
much of that is because of Jack
Buck.
In no other city or for any
other team would there be this
sort of public display for a
broadcaster.
More than 10,000 people
showed up to view Buck’s casket
and be present for his memorial
service Thursday. Many teams
have a hard time getting that
many people in the seats for a

Friday night game against a firstplace team. Buck gave so many
people years of enjoyment that
they felt they needed to say
thanks.
I admired and enjoyed Jack
Buck, even though most of my
memories are of when, to put it in
his words, he was giving his
worst years to the Cardinals.
I did have the honor to be
present for one of his last and
possibly his greatest moments. It
was Sept. 17, 2001, the first day
that M ajor League Baseball
played after the tragedy o f Sept.
11. Jack Buck was the master of
ceremonies during the pre-game
memorial to the victims of the
attacks just six days prior. With
hundreds of police officers,
firefighters and military people
on the field. Jack Buck read a
poem he had written. The
untitled poem struck the patriotic
chord o f every person in
attendance and left few dry eyes.
At a time when people
needed to feel good about
something, Jack Buck provided
it.
It is ironic that one of the
biggest tragedies in Cardinal
history occurred just four days
after his death. When cardinal
pitcher Darryl Kile was found
dead, fans needed a voice to
comfort them. Jack Buck would
have been that voice and he
would have helped ease the pain
felt by so many Cardinals fans
and followers.
He will be missed, but we
should be thankful that he
provided us with so many
memories. When talking about
his life, you can only say, “That’s
a winner.”

The sun is
our only
source of
Vitamin D

W ith sum m er in full swing, tanners are soaking up the rays like a
sponge in water.
Tanning seems
to be a sum m er
ritual for many, but what some
don’t realize or may just ignore
is the harm that is being done to
their bodies.
In order to tan, ultraviolet
rays are actually injuring the
body. The body begins to make
melanin to protect itself, which
is a natural sunscreen. Melanin
is the dark pigm ent that skin
cells
m ake
to
block out
dam aging rays in response to
injury from UV radiation.
Depending on the time of
day, most UV radiation comes
from UVA or UVB. Both cause
skin dam age, but most dam age
is done by UVB. UVA speeds
up skin a ging and causes
wrinkles.
There are three main types
of skin cancer: malignant melanom a, basal cell carcinom a and squamous cell
carcinom a. The least com m on, but deadliest of these is m alignant melanoma.
Regardless of skin color, all people are vulnerable to skin cancer, although
am ong African-Am ericans, for example, the incidence is very low.
Many teens and college students are in search of that perfect tan for the
summer.
Some would argue that not
getting enough sun is unhealthy.
“I have seen studies that show not
getting enough sun is unhealthy,” said
Lindsey Buettner, a high school student.
Like many other teen girls, Buettner
spends nearly 30 m inutes a day tanning
either in a bed or outdoors.
“The sun is o ur only source of
Vitam in D,” Buettner said.
According to ww w .endlesssun.com ,
the sun is the only source of Vitamin D.
T he Web site also said it is possible to get
bone-deform ing diseases from the lack of
sufficient sunlight.
Many believe indoor tanning is safer
than outdoor tanning.
“From what I have heard, it is safer to
use a tanning bed than to lay out in the
sun,” Buettner said.
M any people have been led to
believe that indoor tanning is the safe
alternative to the harmful effects of the
sun. A ccording to the Federal Trade
Com m ission, they have been led in the
wrong direction; there are ju st as many
risks associated with indoor tanning as
with tanning outdoors.

person is bom barded with 15, 20 or 30 minutes of UVA radiation at wavelengths
of 320-400 nanometers, about tw o to three times the UVA in normal sunlight.
Whether a person tans outdoors in the sum m er or indoors all year round, he
or she is increasing the chance of developing skin cancer later in life, suffering
;ataracts and retinal dam age, developing premature skin wrinkling and also
d e v e l o p i n g
ultra vio le t
lightinduced skin rashes
when eating certain foods or
taking com m on m e d ica tion s
such as birth control pills or
antihistamines.
By
tanning
e xclu sive ly
indoors, a person is also
increasing his or her s k in ’s
exposure to the harmful effects
of ultraviolet rays.
Despite these warnings, the
popularity of tanning salons is at
an all-time high.
“ I w ould say we have
around 350 clients and w ay over
half of those are young men and
wom en,” Claire Ritter, em ployee
of St. Louis Tan Co. said.
Skin cancer is rare am ong
young adults, but the future risk
of cancer is much greater.
“Looking good now is im portant. Guys love it when girls have a tan and
know that girls like guys w ho are golden looking, it is just sexy,” Buettner
said.

“I used to work at a tanning salon and it was kind of gross. All these girls
ind guys are just getting fried like a piece of bacon. They get all sweaty and
stinky, it is just not very attractive at first,
but once they come back, they do look
good,” Matt Mason, a form er employee
of St. Louis Tan Co. said.
&
Mason said he never tanned at
the salon.

“I never tanned at work because
I had a construction job outside. I try
to w ear sunscreen as much as possible.
i
I see the older guys w ith leathery

skin and I don’t want to be like that,”
he said.
“I don’t tan at salons because it is
too expensive.
I w ill tan outside

said.
“There are som e people who take
tanning too far. Looking like a crispy
critter is kind of sick,” Callahan said.
“ I will adm it I like girls to look tan, but
seeing all of them tanning, reminds me
of a lizard on a rock,” Mason said.
W ith peer pressure to look like
B ritney S pears, ta n n in g salons and

Two Cougars receive praise for academics
2002 GLVC Players o f the Year Chad Opel and Jenny Esker named Scholar Athletes
K eli K een er
S p o r t s E d it o r

The G reat Lakes Valley
Conference recently
named

Jenny Esker

Jenny Esker o f Steeleville and
Chad Opel, an Edwardsville
native, Scholar Athletes for their
respective sports.
The two Cougar standouts
were selected by the faculty
academic representatives of the
conference’s 11 institutions.
Esker and Opel were seen as
the student athletes who best
exemplified the student athlete
concept in the sports of softball
and baseball.
The criteria for nomination
are threefold. First, academic
excellence
and
academ ic
performance are looked at and
then athletic accomplishments in
the season upon which the award
is based are considered.
Esker,
a
sophom ore
outfielder, is a physics major.
She was the 2002 GLVC

softball Player of the Year and
earned Second Team Verizon
Academic A ll-A m erica honors
earlier this month.
Esker helped SIUE advance
this year into postseason regional
play and led the Cougars to a
school record with 51 victories.
Esker led the team in nearly
all offensive categories. She had
a batting average of .395 and
broke the school record for hits in
a season this year with 83.
She also hit a team-leading
12 home runs, recorded 22
doubles, 210 at bats, 56 runs and
30 stolen bases.
Opel, the 2002 GLVC
baseball Player of the Year,
completed his four-year career at
SIUE with 302 hits, making him
the seventh player in National
Collegiate Athletic Association

Division II history to record 300
or more in a career.
Opel ranks fifth in the
NCAA in career runs scored
with 229 and at bats with 850.
Opel ranks second all-time
at SIUE in hits and at bats while
holding single-season records
for at bats with 274 and runs
scored with 82 which he
accom plished in the 2001
season.
He helped the Cougars to a
30-24 overall record this season
and a third-place finish in the
GLVC Tournament.
The
form er
Cougar
shortstop just signed as a free
agent with the Baltim ore
Orioles organization as a utility
player.
Opel reported to Sarasota,
Fla., last week. He graduated

from SIU E in May with a
bachelor’s degree in kinesiology.

SIUE welcomes 19th annual PSG to campus
Prairie State Games set to begin this weekend across many Southwestern Illinois sites
K e li K een er
S ports E

d it o r

The 19th annual Prairie
State Games, Illinois’ amateur
sports festival, are scheduled this
weekend
across
m any
Southwestern Illinois sites.
The
gam es
are
headquartered in the host city of
Fairview Heights and take place
at more than 45 venues in 13
Southwestern Illinois cities.
The way some sports
will be run will change
this year, according to
Executive D irector Phil
Donato.
“We haven’t added
any new sports, but
w e’ve tweaked some of
the old ones,” Donato
said in an interview with
The Telegraph of Alton
on Tuesday.
B asketball
and
volleyball w ill follow the
same team format as soccer this
year. In previous years, those
two sports w ere divided into
regional team s based on players’
ages. Now they will consist o f
high school teams only.
By next year, Donato said he
will have the age groups divided
the way he wants them in order
to m ake the action easier to
follow.

In the past, it has been
difficult for spectators to
decipher what schools and what
players were cast on a regional
team.
“I think the only regional
sport you will see by next year is
open

soccer,
Donato said. “Open” refers to a

Opel---------------from page 1

W hile at SIUE, Opel
became the seventh player in
National C ollegiate A thletic
Association Division II history
to hammer out more than 300
career hits. He finished his
NCAA Division II career with
302.
Opel also ranks fifth in the
NCAA Division II in runs scored
with 229 and at-bats with 850.
SIUE Baseball Coach Gary
Collins said only Opel can
determine how far he goes.
“I hope he gets to the m ajor
leagues,” Collins said. “Right
now he is in the lowest minor
league and will have to battle his
way up the ladder.”
The climb may be a long
one, as the official Baltimore
Orioles Web site lists Opel as a
5’9”, 170-pound Infielder. Opel
is the smallest man in an infield
that averages 6 ’3” 190 lbs.
Opel says his size is ju st one

of the many things not on his
side.
“I already have three strikes
against me,” Opel said. “I’m
small, I’m slow and I’m old.”
Collins feels that Opel has a
chance.
“His size is not a big
obstacle,” Collins said. “His arm
speed and foot speed are much
more important.”
But, Collins said, O pel’s
numbers are going to have to be
solid.
“He is in professional
baseball now and it’s a very
results-oriented
industry,”
C ollins said. “Produce or
perish.”
In his final season with the
Cougars, Opel led the team with
a .420 batting average, 84 hits,
24 doubles, 109 total bases, 54
runs, 11 stolen bases and 31
walks. He was named to the first
team All-North Central Region.

Opel owns the career record
for runs at SIUE with 59 and he
is second on the all-time list at
SIUE in hits with 302 and at-bats
with 850. Opel’s single season
records include 274 at bats and
82 runs scored in 2001.
In
1998
Opel
led
Edwardsville High School to a
perfect 40-0 record while
winning the state title.
Collins
said
that
the
departure of Opel will leave a
gap to be filled in the cougar
infield.
“Three-hundred hits are
hard to replace,” Collins said. “I
am not expecting whoever takes
Chad’s place to replicate Chad’s
numbers.”
According to Collins, Opel
was a class act.
“Chad meant a great deal to
this program,” Collins said. “He
was well respected by everyone
and he set a great example.”

The last challenge
of a socially
conscious society?
Depression strikes m illions- indiscriminately. Depression is simply a suppression
of brain activity that makes life unbearable. And even though depression is
readily treatable, only 1 in 5 ever seeks treatment. Why do so many just drag
themselves along or eventually seek relief through suicide? First, there's the lack
of awareness of depression- as an illness and as the threat that it is to each and
every one of us. Second, there's the unwarranted negative stigma attached to if.
You know, the 'mental' thing. It's time to collectively face depression. To know it's

(_//V T /? £ / i T B D

an illness, not a weakness. And it's a
challenge that's long overdue. It's
taken too many of us already.
