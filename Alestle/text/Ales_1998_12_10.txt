Professional workers hold information picket
FROM SIUE NEWS SERVICE
The
Professional
Staff
Association, the bargaining agent
for 300 professional staff
employees at SIUE, will conduct
an informational picket today
from 6:30 to 8 a.m. and again
from noon to 1 p.m. at the Delyte

Morris University Center.
The picket is in response to
what the professional staff union
called the university’s unfair
treatment of its employees in
salary negotiations for the 199899 academic year.
According to PSA President
LaDonna Holshouser, the union

has been trying since August to
secure salary increases for
SIU E’s
professional
staff
employees. These increases are
in line with salary increases
provided to other employee
groups within the SIU system.
M embers o f the PSA
rejected SIUE’s latest offer on

Dec. 2. A nother bargaining
session has been scheduled for
Dec. 18.
Holshouser reportedly said
she is hoping to see a more
favorable attitude from the
university in the next session
so that concerns over salary

can be resolved.
Among other jobs, the PSA
workers at SIUE staff the writing
center, the math tutoring program
and
work
as
counselors,
academic
advisers,
early
childhood teachers and teachers
aides.

Waiver gives teachers a break
Marjorie Amzich:
News Stringer
The Illinois Special
Education
Teacher
Tuition
Waiver program offers current
teachers
and
academically
talented students a chance to
pursue careers in any area of
special education.
Marian
Smithson,
director o f financial
aid,
encourages students to take
advantage of this tuition waiver.
“At this time, there are no
teachers taking advantage of this
waiver, but SIUE has 28 studens
attending with (SETTW) tuition
waivers,” she said.
“The students must
apply for this waiver first and

then for financial aid,” she said.
“Each term, recipients are
reviewed and certified for
continuance.”
To qualify, a student
must:
- be a US citizen or
eligible noncitizen and a resident
of Illinois.
- be a high school
graduate or soon-to-be graduate
ranking in the top 50 percent of
his or her class, a person who has
received a GED certificate or a
person holding a valid teaching
certificate in a field other than
special education.
- take the ACT or SAT 1
by the end of the term when the
award is presented.

Southern Illinois University
Edwardsville President Ted
Sanders and Chancellor David
Werner held a press conference
Wednesday morning. The focus
of the conference was the second
Arthur Andersen report. Arthur
Andersen was hired by the
university to provide a business
specialty consulting service.
The report dealt specifically
with the proposal of a shared
services center. This center
would centralize and streamline
the purchasing and disbursement
procedures of all three Southern
Illinois University campuses.
Previously a centralized
system for purchasing and
disbursing goods would have
been difficult due to the heavy
use of manual record keeping on
all three campuses. “With our
recent move to Oracle we can
now consider this [the SSC],”
Sanders said.
The streamlining of these
services will impact about 55 to
60 people. "The net affect is the
reduction of as many as 25

staffing positions,” Sanders said.
"This university has enough
tunrover to accom m odate the
reallocation of those affected. We
are a large enough organization
to be humane.” The AnderseiT
report took into account the
reallocation and retraining of
those affected by the SSC.
The SSC is only part of a
total
reorganization
being
considered by the university.
Other
program s
include
preferred-vendor contracts and
procurement cards for campus
units such as maintenance,
according to Sanders and Werner.
Preferred-vendor contracts
allow the university to save
money by purchasing products
for all three campuses on the
same bid. This program has
already affected some areas.
SIUE has piggybacked with the
Carbondale campus and is saving
$50,000 a year on food services.
Ken Neher, vice chancellor for
adm inistration at SIUE, is
participating in the process of
overseeing the bids for copier
services which will save an
estimated $250,000 per year.
Procurem ent cards allow

certain units to order and receive,
within 24 hours, the products
they need. The cards remove
much of the red tape involved
with purchasing items. In the past
too much paperwork and time
was involved in ordering and
receiving even the smallest item.
The
Andersen
report
estim ates that with the SSC
alone, annual savings would be
close to $640,000 per year, after
im plem entation
costs
are
recovered. Andersen would not
have recom m ended the SSC
unless the university would stand
to recover at least $350,000 per
year, according to Sanders. Total
savings from the combined
programs are estimated near $5
million per year, again after
im plem entation
costs
are
recovered.
The earliest estimated time
frame for implementation of the
SSC is fiscal 1999, or more likely
fiscal 2000, according to Werner.
This report along with
recom m endations
from
the
Illinois board of higher education
will be discussed Thursday at the
SIUE board of trustee’s meeting.

Student government adds new members
ALESTLE STAFF REPORT
The ranks o f the Student
Goverment increased by two
members in recent months.
Alicia Herring and Joshua
Schuette are newly appointed
student senators.
Herring is a junior majoring
in biology/m edical sciences,
though most o f her time is
devoted to her sorority. Alpha
Phi. She was instated as a student
senator on Oct. 23, a position
which, she said, allows her to “be
able to have an active role with

what happens on campus.”
“I think Student Government
is a great opportunity to be
informed about the things
happening on cam pus, and it
makes you feel like you are part
of a campus where your opinions
really do matter," Herring said.
Joshua Schuette, a junior
majoring
in
international
business and m inoring in
marketing, states similar reasons
for joining up.
“I like being able to be a part
of something that represents all
students,” said Schuette, who

was appointed student senator on
November 6. “I think Student
Government is something more
people should become involved
in. We deal with issues that affect
everyone’s classes and campus
organizations. Becoming more
involved will also bolster our
school spirit.”
For more inform ation on
Student Government, call 6503819 or visit their office on the
first floor o f the Morris
University Center.

And now I finally understand you
Rubbing the sleep from my eyes
and forcing myself to remove my head
from a pile of books and old clothes, I
woke up with a deep feeling of
understanding.
My mother had sent me a fruit
Belton basket. In it was fruit snacks, four apples
(two red that I hate, two green that I love)
and four oranges. One of the oranges was molded
completely. Rotten juices flowed out of it as I picked
it up and threw it away. The rest was salvageable, so
I ate them all except the red apples, never realizing
the significance of this semi-annual gift my parents
send me. After all, I am spoiled.
And not spoiled in the sense that my parents
gave me whatever I wanted and gave in to my every
whim, but spoiled by the attention my mother has
always paid to me. No one else I know gets a fruit
basket from home. They would celebrate if someone
in this world would show some sign of affection by
sending them anything.
1 went to my English class, where for
presentations my peers shared personal stories of
their lives. I looked into the eyes of people I'd hardly
noticed and saw their souls and felt very emotional.
I thought we were supposed to be talking about
books, but each time it became something else. Even
when I had given my presentation weeks earlier, I
couldn’t talk about what I’d read without talking
about myself. The racism in our novels became the
racism in our lives and the pain in the literature
became the pain in our hearts.
Although I had awakened with a sense of love
and understanding, the world seemed determined to
fill my mind with the pain and reality of the present.
And a powerful feeling told me to write about it.
I know what everyone in my class wanted to say
as they spoke. While some spoke more eloquently
than others, all were nervous and each story was
valuable for the lessons they related. Each speaker
wanted consciousness and each one wanted
understanding. They spoke of people like green
apples and molded oranges. Some things were
bittersweet while others were sour and ruined.
Racism is like a moldy orange, its juice oozing
from the cracks of society. Even though I threw my
orange away, the mold is still there in the air. It is
waiting for something else I have neglected, like a
piece of bread or the damp shower I have not
cleaned, to come along so it can contaminate and
ruin it instead. That is racism. Just because you can’t
see it does not mean that it isn't there. It still lurks,
waiting to snatch up what has been discarded and
neglected. It still ruins what we should have been
protecting.
The green apples are the people in my life that I
know and the ones that I don’t. All of us working
together for and against each other in the scheme of
things, wondering when the understanding will
come. Some will be consumed by the mold that is
the pain and suffering in our lives; others will
somehow avoid that fate and move on to be
something useful.

Beauty’s only leaf deep
An unconventional Christmas tree can be found in the
University Restaurant in the Morris University Center. The
fake plant is decorated with various objects found around
the resturant. It currently is in the midst of a rivalry with
the artifical evergreen tree in another part of the

All of us will live to wake up on mornings and
have moments of understanding. Understanding that
is profound and clear but a little uncertain. I am
spoiled because at some point in my classmates’
lives racism or pain has taken someone they loved
away from them and I have not yet had to endure
such a pain. Since I was little, I have always had the
reassurance that my parents will always be there for
me. They send me fruit baskets, and they come and
get me from school whenever I want. They nurse me
when I am sick and still love me when I fail or hurt
them. I’ve never gone a Christmas without a present,
a day without a meal, a minute without their warmth
and protection.
When I was little, I didn’t understand why my
classmates thought it was so wonderful that my
mother would bring me my hat and gloves at school
if I forgot them. I was about to make that same
mistake with the fruit basket. Big deal, Mommy just
sent it, she always does that.
Then I thought to myself that she always does
that. Whether she is mad at me or not, whether she
is tired and sick or just wants to be left alone, she has
never told me to go away. I just realized yesterday
that my mother doesn’t just love me, she is in love
with me, just as she has always been before I was
bom. When you think of your parents as being in
love with you, it changes everything. It explains
their madness about their children and why they
behave the way they do, because at some point
we’ve all been in love. But try to imagine that same
painful love you’d have for someone you just started
dating and imagine what that love would be if it was
with someone you helped create.
Imagine the madness that love would cause
after loving something that is never guaranteed to
love you back, that will disrespect you and disobey
you and at some point hurt you deeply. But you can’t
stop loving it because it is your child and you
allowed it to grow inside of you. nearly kill you and
then take over your life.
My parents had lives before my sister and I
came along. Only being in love can make you give
up your freedom to turn over your life to a helpless
tiny thing that will grow up to be the pain and the
pride of your life. My parents, once young and
selfish like me, would die for me and my sisters.
And, like all parents, they loved me before they even
knew they loved me.
And that is the understanding I woke up with
this morning. I woke up understanding that the love
we are all searching for is already there inside of us.
1 woke up realizing that the pain and suffering that is
life grows on the same trees as the fruit of life’s love
and beauty.
Maybe it’s all the green and red ribbons
decorating the buildings, or maybe its the frosty,
cold air, but I can finally feel myself growing older.
I finally think I understand what this season is really
about. All we are searching for is an understanding
of who we really are.

Flipping off the TV, I spread books
and notes across my desk. In the kitchen,
my coffee pot brewed its anti-sleep study
potion and my phone cord lay
disconnected on the floor. I was ready to
pull an “all-nighter.” As I began
reviewing my notes on the ancient
Mayan people, the lights in my
apartment flickered and then went off.
I cursed under my breath and sat in
the darkness hoping the power would
come back on in a few seconds.
Unfortunately, it didn’t. I glanced out the
window and found the entire parking lot
cloaked in darkness. I could only
vaguely see the outline of the parked
cars. Since the last Cougar Village
power outage lasted nearly seven hours,
I got up to search for my flashlight.
Finding my flashlight without
batteries, I broke Cougar Village law and
lit some candles. Figuring that my hardass professor wouldn’t accept “no
electricity" as a reason for not studying,
I vainly squinted and tried to resume my
all-night cram-o-rama. Suddenly, a
thunderous crash shook my desk and the
candles went out. Fumbling with the
matches, I tried to relight them.
It almost sounded like a tree had
fallen, except the noise came from the
apartment below. I heard someone
rushing up the steps and, sure enough,
there was a knock at my door.
I opened the door to Dave, a
backwoods militia wanna-be whom I
avoided at all costs. Whenever he got
nervous, he gnawed on his bottom lip
like it was a tough piece of jerky. Just
then, he was gnawing that lip into
oblivion.
“Umm ... I was wonderin’ if you
had a first-aid kit or some bandages or
somethin'. O ne'a Bobby Joe’s pipe
bombs accidentally went off,” he said
holding his side. It was then I noticed
thin strands of smoke steaming off his
hair.
I gave him some Band-Aids and
peroxide and I quickly shut and bolted
the door. Before I could get back to my
desk, someone knocked again. I looked
out the peephole but only saw darkness.
“Who is it?”
“It’s Mike, your RA. I’m here for
cleaning inspections.”
“What? It’s 10 in the evening and
the power is out.”
“Just doing my job."
Reluctantly, I opened the door and
my RA scampered in with his flashlight
and clipboard. “I forgot all about these
inspections,” I said, “I’ve been trying to
study for a big exam tomorrow.”
He said nothing but began to sniff
the air like a police dog trying to detect
some trace of a controlled substance. He
turned his head toward me and gave me
a dissatisfied look. “Follow me, sir.” He
walked into my room and pointed the
beam of his flashlight at my candles.
“What the hell is that?’
“Well, I didn’t have any batteries
so I just ... hey man, they’re only
candles. I’ve got this exam to study for.”
“Did you know that section three,
article 12 of the Cougar Village
handbook says candles are strictly
prohibited? People get expelled from
school for violations like this, Mr.
Dalton.”
“You’re kidding, right?” He
handed me a cleaning inspection failure
slip.
‘Til have to report this violation
and you’ll have to explain yourself to the
housing coordinator," he said and
walked out of the room. He eventually
failed my furnace closet and bathroom
and found a grain of salt in the oven,
which constitutes an automatic failure of
the entire kitchen. After about an hour
the RA left and I returned to my books.
As I tried to recite the architectural
contributions of the Maya, I heard yet
another pounding at my door. This time
I just kept on studying until a man
yelled, “This is the police, open up!
Don’t make us have to break this door
down!"
I rushed to the door and two large
police officers stormed in. Before I could
react, I was thrown face-down on the
carpet with a gun to my head. The fall
temporarily knocked the wind out of me,
so I couldn't yell as the other officer
ransacked my apartment.
“Be careful, Butch. The place
might be wired with explosives,” said
the officer as he drove his knee into my

back, steadily holding the gun to my
head.
After a few gasps, my breath
returned. Unfortunately, the searcher had
already knocked over my table, emptied
my bookshelf and thrown the
microwave on the ground.
“Stop it, you moron. This is
apartment 2C, not 1C. That bombmaking militia maniac is downstairs.”
The cop took his knee out of my back
and holstered his gun.
“Oh, we apologize, sir. We
couldn't really see the number on the
door. The power is out, you know.”
“No, I hadn’t noticed,” I said,
trying to readjust my spine. The two
officers stood silently and looked down
at their feet like kids who just got caught
punching their little brother.
“We’re really sorry, it will never
happen again ... Umm, would you mind
if I got a glass of water or something? All
this work has made me thirsty.”
“Me too,” said the second officer.
“You mind if I make a quick phone
call?” the officer who altered my spinal
alignment asked. I plugged the phone
back in so the officer could call the
department.
After the two officers drank the
sodas I gave them and laughed about
coming to the wrong apartment, they
went downstairs to Dave’s apartment. I
heard them kick down the door, which
set off a few explosions followed by a
barrage of gunfire. Eventually, the
gunfire stopped and I heard the police
escort Dave out of his apartment, which
meant I could get back to studying.
It was now 12:30 a.m. and my
exam started at 8 a.m. That left me about
seven good study hours. Before I could
even sit at my desk, the phone rang.
Although I knew I'd regret it, I
answered.
“Jimmmm, man. What's up? I ...
I'm like totally wasted, dude,” said my
degenerate roommate through a burst of
slurred, drunken laughter.
How I, a guy who checked the 6no
smoking, no drinkingO box on my
Cougar Village application, ended up
with the campus's biggest alcoholic is a
mystery only University Housing could
solve.
“Damn it, Pauly. Where the hell are
you?"
“Man, chill out. I couldn’t hold it
ya know, so I went.”
‘Couldn't hold what'?”
“Dude, if you got to go, ya go.
How’s I gonna know the cops were
watching me, those perverts.”
“Pauly did you piss behind
Shenanigans again? Are you in jail?”
“Man, you know what I'm saying
... it’s police brutality and my lawyer,
man ... I didn’t ... they planted those
drugs on me,” Pauly said and regressed
into some incomprehensible babble and
laughter.
As much as I wanted to leave him
there, my conscience forced me to drive
the familiar route to Edwardsville City
Jail. Luckily my inebriated roommate,
who probably robbed a bank before
getting plastered, had enough money on
him to post bail.
I drove his passed-out body back to
our apartment and put him out on the
balcony with an old blanket. It was now
3 a.m. and I had less than five hours to
cram for my exam. I put on another pot
of coffee.
Re-invigorated with caffeine's
energizing power, I jammed information
into my head at a record pace. The lights
came back on at 4 am . I started feeling
pretty good, like nothing could stop me.
I was like Michael Jordan playing the
Knicks. At 7:30 a.m. I packed up my
books. Though extremely groggy. I felt
confident.
Unfortunately I couldn’t find my
car in the parking lot. The space where I
had parked was empty except for some
scattered glass. At this point, it almost
seemed right for my car to be stolen.
After quickly reporting it I ran to class
and arrived as the exams were being
handed out.
Like a man possessed, I attacked
that exam. I never stopped writing
except to shake off the occasional sleep
deprivation-induced
hallucination.
Finishing my test first, I slammed it on
the instructor's desk. Ignoring my
professor who I think said something to
me. I went home to sleep for a few hours
before I had to start studying for my
three other exams.

Hitchcock’s “Psycho” with no new twists
Director Gus Van Sant remakes the classic horror film from the ’60s.
BY TRAVIS NUCKOLLS
LIFESTYLE STRING ER
The newest addition in the realm of remade movies is Alfred
Hitchcock’s horror classic “Psycho.” In many cases the word “remake”
brings with it a full load of questions: Will it be changed in any way?
Will the cast members be right for their parts? Will they do a good job?
Will it be as good as the original? This remake has been unique from
the start because no attempt was made to change the original story. In
fact, every effort was
made to retell the
original story — shot
for shot and line for
line.
This new version
features Vince
Vaughn as Norman
Bates, the part
originally played by
Anthony Perkins. The
film also stars Anne
Heche as the blond
Anne Heche P l a y s Marion Crane in the famous shower death scene.
beauty taking a
shower, William H.
Macy as the private detective and Julianne Moore as the shower girl’s sister. (I am not going to give away any more o f the
plot because most people already know it, and in the one in a trillion chance you do not already know the plot, it would
be a shame to ruin it for you)
To answer the first question, the film was changed just slightly. There is a bit more nudity in the shower scene (only
because when the movie was made the first time the censors would not allow it). There is also a bit more blood. For the
most part however, the film has not changed a bit. Director Gus Van Sant has made the same movie, with different actors
and an updated time frame.
Are the cast members right for their parts? Will they do a good job? Yes, they are and yes, they do, particularly Vince
Vaughn who plays Norman Bates with the same befuddled and innocent coyness that made Anthony Perkins so terrifying
many years ago.
The final question: will it be as good as the original? The answer is yes; the ’90s “Psycho” is a great Hitchcock flick.
In the end, this film is no better and no worse than the first one. It inspires the same chills and terror, but only in the
Vince Vaughn is the psychotic
minds of those who have never seen the original picture. For those who have seen the original, this remake reminds
Norman Bates with an undying
viewers why they liked it in the first place. Deciding on which one you like better comes down to one more very simple
love for his mother.
question: color or black and white?

Polly E sther’s, a ’70s
themed nightclub, opened on
Friday, November 20, to much
acclaim and fanfare. The club
centers around the 1970s with
the music, drink names such as
the “Sonny and Cher” and
memoribilia around the club
for nostalgic rememberences.
A Farah Fawcet collage
greets club-goers as they step
into the ’70s spotlight. The
Partridge family bus sits along
the wall with seats for weary
dancers,
tired from
the
fantastic ’70s mixes. The dance
floor is a replica of the floor in
“Saturday Night Fever,” with a

four-foot disco ball hung high
above.
The club encourages
guests to wear their best ’70s
attire. The dress code is no
hats, tank tops or flip-flops for
men. Women can come as they
are.
There is a small cover
charge and an age restriction of
21 and up, but the place is so
groovy that it doesn’t matter.
Polly Esther’s is at the
comer of Washington Avenue
and 12th Street, in downtown
St.Louis. There is valet parking
at the front door, or public
parking
around
back.
For more inform ation, call
(314) 436-9420.

People help MDA ..because MDA helps people.

The rumors of my death
have been greatly exaggerated.
OK sure, I was very near
death and all, but you weren’t
going to get rid of me that easily.
I’m not really sure what crazy
things have been flying around
me the last week or so, but no I
was not a witness for the
impeachment hearings; I did not
have any wacky hair-dying
accidents; nor did I come down
with any wacky STDs (that I
know of).
Somehow I contracted
spinal meningitis.
How? It beats the hell out of
me. I really did not want to pass
out nearly two weeks ago and
have my siblings find me nude
and deliriously tearing up a
magazine in my room.
Four days later I find myself
waking up in intensive care with
tubes jam m ed into two of my
most uncomfortable holes. Trust
me, when they took those out, I
actually did pray a little. Now
the last time I did any staying in
a hospital I was an infant, so this
has not been the most pleasant
experience in my life.
For some reason, when you
have this sort o f serious disease,
the doctors and nurses like to
pop in about every five seconds,
just to make sure you’re still
alive. I mean come on, I only
flat-lined once.
I think I had more drugs
pumped through me in the last
two weeks than Courtney Love,
Rick James and the cast of the
“Golden Girls” put together, and
I have the marks and bruises on
my arms to prove it. Actually if
you connect the IV holes on my
arms, it spells out “Love” and
“Hate.”
It was nearly impossible for
them to track down exactly
where I had contracted this nasty
little spinal disorder. I could
have gotten it from a carrier who
never even had the disease
himself, from drinking after
someone or having someone get
crazy with a voodoo Corey doll
in the spine.

see RANTS, page 7

T h u r s d a y , D e c e m b e r 10, 1998

RANTS-------------see page 6

By the way I did sleep
through both spinal taps, which
was a blessing. I also dropped
another 20 pounds since
Thanksgiving, so many of you
probably won’t recognize my
scrawny ass.
I have my own theory as to
how I may have contracted this
thing, though. I think word may
have gotten out that I was
planning on writing my column
for another semester. And I
know there are a few groups of
people out there who have not
enjoyed my sick sense o f humor,
irate opinions or shocking
revelations over the years. I
think they may have gotten
together to try and get rid of me.

T h e

I noticed a few weeks back
that the breaks were getting a
little weak on my car, but I was
able to pull a Fred Flintstone to
safety. This must have frustrated
those who strove to put a stop to
“Rants and Raves.” So I imagine
they wanted to try more drastic
measures. Maybe I was injected
with something. Who knows? I
plan on getting in touch with
those three weirdoes from the
“X-Files” to help me discover
the source behind this attempt
to silence me forever.
I will keep a close eye on
the College Republicans, the
Klan, the custodial services
staff, the fraternities and even
the administration from now on.
Now I’m not accusing anyone
(yet), but it’s better to be a
“Spooky” Mulder than a

A l e s t l e

dead Flip Wilson.
I would also like to take this
opportunity to thank all my
professors and employers for
being so patient with me during
my illness. Have a very nice
holiday break.
I will return next semester,
but not with “Rants and Raves.”
1 plan on starting a new and
creative project for my last
semester called “Random
Mutterings.” Hope you enjoy it.
Have a splendid break.

(Editor’s note: A ll o f us
at the Alestle wish Mr. Stulce a
speedy recovery. It wouldn ’t
be the same here without you.
But you might want to add the
editorial staff to your
conspiracy list...)

A fte r splitting its two G reat L akes V alley C onference gam es
last w eek, th e S IU E m e n ’s basketball tea m gears up Saturday for
its toug hest test so far this season as No. 2 ra n k e d U niversity of
Southern Indiana invades the V adalabene C enter.
The C ougars will set out to hand S o u th ern Indiana its first
loss of the season, but S IU E will have to co ntend with a wellbalanced team th at includes the G LV C ’s leading scorer, L eighton
Nash, w ho averages 21 points per game.
K im on G re en and Junior B ond will a n c h o r S outhern Indiana
defensively as they have posted 2.14 blocks and 1.70 steals per
gam e respectively.
The C ougars have yet to get on a roll this year, recording a 33 overall record and a 2-2 conference m ark.
M ore th an 1400 cheering fans cam e o u t Dec. 3 to see S IU E
hand the U niversity of Indianapolis a 79-66 loss.
S IU E took it to Indianapolis from th e start. The Cougars
fru strated th e ir op p o n en t with solid d efense and took a 38-24
lead into halftim e.
In the second half, S IU E shot the ball m ore effectively going
50 p ercen t from the field and running aw ay for a 13-point win.
B en W ierzba stole the show w ith a 27-point perform ance. H e
w ent 6 o f 12 from the field and drain ed 10 o f 11 from the line.
Ty M oss ad ded 13 points and seven bo ard s while A n tonio
M cK inzie and Travis W allbaum c o n trib u te d nine reb o u n d s
apiece.
S IU E failed to take the sam e intensity in to its game against
N o rth ern K entucky Saturday.
M oss and M cK inzie each tossed in 14 points and W allbaum
n ette d 13 points and nine boards in an 80-67 loss.
A dreadful shooting perform ance in th e first half had S IU E
dow n 42-27 going into the locker room . T he C ougars found its
shooting touch in the final half shooting 50 percent, b u t the
deficit was too g reat for S IU E to spark a legitim ate com eback.
S a tu rd a y ’s gam e against S o u thern In d ian a tips-off at 3 p.m.

‘Tis th e se aso n fo r giving. The

P a rt o f th e p ro ceed s will go to charity and

It has been fo u r y ears and I
still d o n ’t get it.
I’m not saying so ccer is bad,
I’m just saying I c a n ’t play it
and have no desire to play it.
B ut I can respect th e players
w ho do play soccer because
anybody w ho can ru n non sto p

I also w ant to say th a t over

B rett L icata and S pann in it for
the first tim e in fo u r years.
I also have to th a n k the copy

cause som e unw anted laughter.
A n d o u r graphics guy, M ike

T hanks for your help, Mike.

Well, due to th e space I have
given m yself it looks like I
need to w rap things up.

th a n k s

“I t’s gratifying to leave you

A little something from Brett
H as it b een th re e years already? W hen I cam e to the
A lestle during th e second sem ester o f my freshm an year, I
nev er realized I ’d still be here a w eek shy of graduation.
T hree years o f w atching gam es and talking to coaches
has given m e a unique outlook on how college sports
o perate. I w ant to th an k all those coaches who to o k tim e
o u t to talk w ith m e ... even after a tough loss. You m ade my
jo b a lot easier.
I ’d also like to th a n k m y fellow A lestle staff writers.
W e’ve gone th ro u g h a to n of them since I ’ve b een here, b u t
this p ast sem ester h ad to be the best group I ’ve w orked

thanks for m otivating m e to get a job.
If th e re ’s o n e thing I ’ve learned here it’s th a t S IU E has
som e o f th e m o st com petitive sports team s on a yearly

Broncos say slacking
off is not an issue
D E N V E R (A P ) — H om e-field is in the bag, and the A F C West
title is a distant m em ory of two weeks ago. So w hat do the
D enver B roncos have left to play for over the se a so n ’s rem aining
three w eeks?
Plenty.
"W e’re not slacking off, so d o n ’t nobody ask th a t question,”
D enver wide receiver R od Sm ith said M onday.
“W e’re n o t slacking off at all. We have a lot o f goals we want
to continue to reach.”
The B roncos (13-0) have won 18 straight gam es dating to the
1997 regular-season and playoffs and can set th e N F L record
Sunday with victory No. 19 at the New Y ork G iants.
“ My No. 1 goal would be to win 19 in a row,” coach Mike
Shanahan said. “If we win, it would be very special to this football
team and this organization.”
D en v e r’s streak, w hich began last Dec. 22 against San Diego,
nearly cam e to an end Sunday before John E lw ay led a fourthq u a rte r rally th a t gave the B roncos a 35-31 w in o v er the Kansas
City Chiefs.
The victory cam e despite th ree D enver turnovers, a botched
punt, a blocked field goal and several key penalties, raising the
question of w h e th er the quest to go u n b ea te n is taking its toll.
“T he pressure is obviously huge, and I th ink w e ’ve m anaged to
keep it in the background fairly effectively,” defensive end
H arald H asselbach said. “W e're going to have to keep doing that
because it’s only going to get tougher.”
In addition to the m ounting pressure of joining the 1972
M iam i D olphins (14-0) as the N FL ’s only un b eaten s, the Broncos
are facing inspired opponents trying to poison perfection.
“E veryone know s w e’re the best team in the league right now,
and being u n d efeate d , every te a m ’s going to com e up w ith their
best gam e against us,” cornerback D a rrien G o rd o n said.
“M ore team s a re going to look a t this as th e ir S uper Bowl, and
I think from h e re on out, every team is ju st going to try to do
w hatever they can do to get a win against us.”

Colon cancer is the second leading cancer killer and everyone
aged 50 and older is at risk. More than 50,000 Americans
will die from colon cancer and 131,600 new cases will be
diagnosed this year.
C olon cancer is an equal opportunity disease that affects both
wom en and men. This silent killer frequendy begins without symp­
toms and those with a family history are at even greater risk.
Colon cancer is preventable— even curable when detected early. In
fact, if cancer is found early enough, the patient has more than a 90
percent chance o f survival.
C olon cancer screenings are safe and effective and are now covered
by Medicare and an increasing number o f other health providers.
There’s even a test rhar ran be used in the privacy o f your own
home.
