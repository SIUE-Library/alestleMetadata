NEWS EDITOR
Christa Oxford, director of
Admissions and Registrar, has been
named acting assistant vice
chancellor
for
Enrollment
Management.
Oxford was appointed by
Sharon Hahs, acting provost and
vice chancellor for Academic
Affairs. Before her appointment,
the position had been left vacant by
Richard Dremuk, who retired Dec.
31 after 11 years of service at SIUE.
Oxford has been with SIUE
since 1977. Previously she served
as director of the Office of
Continuing Education, director of
Academic Marketing Services and
coordinator o f the Student
Information System project.
Oxford is also active in
community and professional
organizations. She has served as
state coordinator of the American
Council on Education’s National
Identification Program for the
advancement of Women in Higher
Education Administration.
Before joining SIUE, Oxford
was associated with the University
Centre and management studies
department in the Division of
Continuing Education at the
University of M anitoba in
Winnipeg, Canada where she
received a bachelor degree with
honors in history and political
science. She completed her MBA
at SIUE.

To cu lm in ate a y ear-lo n g
celeb ratio n o f S IU E ’s 4 0th
anniversary,
the
St.
L ouis
Sym phony O rc h estra w ill be
m aking its first appearance here
since the M ississip p i R iv er
Festival closed its doors in 1978.
R ich Walker, coordinator o f
the A rts & Issues Series, said the
A pril 30 p erfo rm an ce o f the
Sym phony is nearly sold out.
“We have done no m arketing for
this event other than the A rts &
Issues season brochure,” W alker
said. “There are only 200 tickets
left. T he target m ark et o f
M adison and St. C lair county
region is m ore than a quarter
m illion people, b ut the capacity
o f the M eridian B allroom is only
800 seats. It’s discouraging we
don’t have larger facilities so that
we can offer m ore tickets.”
W alker has been bo o k in g
talent for the A rts & Issues series
since 1986 and said that every

year he gets literally hundreds of
suggestions for events.
“Every year I start w ith a
m ission list an d b eg in paring
dow n from there,” W alker said.
“ A fter I ’ve n arro w e d th e list
dow n to 20 or 30 nam es, I start
contacting agents for fee ranges
and availability. I try to find
speakers w ho have credible name
recognition w ith an academ ic tie
and who are a little left and right
o f center o f the political aisle.
“M any o f the speakers will
m ake adjustm ents in their fees for
us and som e agents ju s t com e
right out and say, ‘forget it, you
ca n ’t afford u s,” ’ W alker said.
W alker said the fees range
from
$ 3 ,0 0 0
to
$14,000
depending on celebrity status of
the guest and that the speakers
tend to be a little m ore expensive.
To offset som e o f the expenses he
solicits sponsors and spends a
great deal o f tim e doing fund­
raising.
“It’s a c o n s ta n t tra d e -o ff
trying to get the best fo r both
sides w hen I negotiate contracts,”

W alker said. “A ll the contracts
are different depending on the
artist or the speaker.”
Each season has a 12 to 18
m onth planning cycle and W alker
said he has nearly com pleted the
schedule for the 1998-99 season.
In the 12 years W alker has
been coordinator he has m et and
spent tim e w ith som e very
fam ous people. H as he ev er felt
intim idated or star-struck?
“W ell, so m etim es, y es,”
W alker said. “Som e individuals
either support (intim idation) or
dispel it.
“Part o f my jo b is to provide
airport transportation for guests
and once I picked up W illiam F.
Buckley and w as bringing him to
the cam pus and it struck him
w hen we crossed the riv er that he
w as actually visiting tw o states.
H e asked m e w hat the difference
in the tax structure w as betw een
the tw o states. I w as trying to
keep the conversation light w hile
I w as negotiating traffic and off­
handedly said, ‘W ell, both states
h av e th e m ,” ’ W alk er said.

“U nfortunately, he d id n ’t see the
hum or in m y rem ark and things
k in d o f w ent d o w n h ill from
there.”
O n the flip side, W alker said
som e o f the guests have been
very personable.
“I had the ho n o r o f having
learned the H eim lich m aneuver
fro m
Dr.
H en ry
H eim lich
him self,” W alker said. “He was
one o f th e k in d e st, m ost
personable people I have ever
m et.”
W alker
also
reco u n ted
m em ories o f taking form er CIA
D irector Stansfield T urner to the
E dw ardsville D airy Q ueen for ice
cream .
“M onths later I saw him in
W ashington, D .C . and he called
m e by n a m e ,” W alk er said.
“F o rm e r G reat B rita in P rim e
M inister H arold W ilson cam e to
m y hom e fo r tea, and then invited
m y wife and I to visit him when
w e m ade a trip to E ngland. How
m any people can say they were
the guest o f a prim e m inister?”

House republicans push property tax relief plan
SPR IN G FIELD , 111. (AP) —
S eeking to reta k e th e H ouse,
Republicans laid out an electionyear plank Tuesday as they called
for $223 m illion a year in tax
re lie f
fo r
m id d le-class
hom eow ners.
B ut the plan p u sh e d by
H ou se M in o rity L ea d er L ee
D aniels, R -Elm hurst, got a cool
recep tio n
from
the
adm inistration, w here Gov. Jim
E dgar has cautioned law m akers
to avoid going on a spending
binge.
The m easure w ould provide
relief by doubling the existing

incom e tax credit from 5 percent
to 10 percent for property taxes
paid. The credit could be applied
to hom es valued under $500,000.
T he proposal m ight also be
aim ed at h elp in g R ep u b lican s
ingratiate them selves w ith voters
w hen they only need to w in two
seats to rec ap tu re th e H ouse
majority. D em ocrats hold a 60-58
majority.
D aniels’ estim ates showed:
A dow nstate resident with a
$100,000 hom e an d a $2,480
annual property tax bill would
save $124.
A C ook C ounty resident with

a $100,000 hom e and a $3,280
p ro p erty tax b ill w o u ld save
$164.
“T he h ardw orking m iddleclass fam ilies o f Illinois need and
dem an d p ro p erty tax re lie f,”
D aniels said.
T he
m in o rity
lead er
m ain tain ed th e s ta te ’s fiscal
health allow s for the tax relief.
But Steve S chnorf, E d g ar’s
budget director, said he is “not
certain that the budget, as I see it
laying out, has room in it for a
rev en u e
red u c tio n
of
th at
m agnitude.”
D aniels predicted the state

treasury should end the year with
$1 billion and w ould still have
m ore than $800 m illion after the
property tax relief.
S c h n o rf d isa g re ed
w ith
D a n ie ls’ c a lc u latio n s. S ch n o rf
said E d g ar’s goal is to propose a
b u d g et
w ith
ch ild re n
and
ed u catio n b eing p rio ritie s and
h aving an adequate reserve.
H ouse S p eak e r M ichael
M ad ig an , D -C h icag o , d id not
reject the proposal outright but
n o te d
D em o crats
have
historically sought to help tenants
as w ell as hom eow ners.

“ Mr. Boulay had difficulty

A different kind of double standard
L ast n ig h t a
Texas w om an w as
put to d ea th fo r
attac k in g
and
killing tw o people
w ith a pickaxe.
B efore
her
d eath she p ro cla im e d a turn
around in h er life, she claim ed to
have been show n the light by a
higher source, and w hat w as once
lost w as now saved. B ut this tim e
a relig io u s con v ersio n w a sn ’t
enough to avoid the saccharine
laced kiss o f death.
M any cam e to the defense o f
the now d eceased K arla F ae
T ucker. R eligious leaders and
death p enalty opponents alike
cam e to Texas to p ro test her
death. This has caused m any to
ponder w hy her death w as so

different from any other inm ate
on death row. Some believed that
the only reason she w as receiving
m edia attention was because of
her gender. Tucker w as the first
w om an executed in Texas since
the C ivil War. She m ade the
precedent as all began to w onder
w hether she’d m ake it past m id­
night on her last day to live.
I agree that gender had m uch
to do w ith the atten tio n she
received. If it had been a Carl
Tucker, the case w o u ld n ever
have m ade the light o f day in our
vengeful society. B ut w hy should
her gender m ake a difference.
A fter all, she did m u rd er tw o
people w ith a pickaxe and w asn ’t
one o f the goals o f the fem inist
m ovem ent during th e 1960s
gender equity? M ore m en are on

d eath row th an w o m en and
w om en are less lik e ly to be
sentenced to death. T h ere are
u su ally
som e
touchy
circu m stan ces in v o lv ed . M any
w om en w ho are on death row are
often th ere fo r k illin g th eir
h u sb an d s o r th e ir ch ild ren .
W om en co m m it few er v io len t
crim es than m en and are often
v iew ed in so ciety
as the
oppressed, not the oppressors.
M any found it hard to look into
K arla F ae T u c k e r’s ey es, a
w o m an ’s ey es, an d see a
coldhearted killer. T he fact that
she h ad com m itted these crim es
and now m ust face th e sam e
punishm ent that m any m en face
every year in Texas should not
w eigh any heavier on our hearts
than the death o f any other felon.

W h eth er falsely ac cu sed or
calculated m urderers, m en are
put to death in T exas yearly,
keep in g the L one S tar S tate
ahead o f the nation in the num ber
o f executions per year.
It’s a different kind o f double
standard. Sim ilar to the sam e one
th at
allow s
m o re
A frican
A m erican m ales the privilege o f a
death sentence com pared to their
w h ite co u n terp arts.
P erh ap s
sim ilar to the k in d w here the rich
an d fam ous g et co m m u n ity
service for the sam e crim es the
public goes to prison for.
I t’s a d iffe ren t double
stan d ard th at h in g es on how
A m erica view s its w om en. A
view that can only see w om en as
victim s. N o one w ants to see a
w om an die, but w hy? Because

our ow n eyes do not see her as
the com m itter o f these crim es,
b u t a w om an, g en tle and
ch a n g ed ? O r is this ju s t a
reflection on how society view s
all w om en as a m em b er o f the
victim
class
in
our society? O r is it that the death
o f a w om an cau se s us to
reflec t upon an d fee l g u ilty
ab o u t b ein g one o f th e few
m odernized nations to still utilize
the death penalty?
H er soul is at rest. O ne o f her
victim ’s loved ones has stated
that he now feels at peace. Yet,
due to the co m p lex ity o f our
ju d ic ia l system , m any o th er
A m ericans w ill not feel the same.

Commentary
Edgar seeking to fix what’s wrong, but can he pull it o ff
SPRIN G FIELD , 111. (A P) —
A bove all else, Gov. Jim E dgar
delivered one overriding m essage
in his State o f the State address:
H e w ants to take on w hat’s w rong
w ith Illinois before he leaves
next year.
The question is, w hat can
he accom plish?
In a series o f p ro p o sals
unveiled W ednesday, E dgar m ade
it
c lea r
he
w ants
m ore
accountability in the state’s court
system , w ants future governors to
have m ore control o f the state’s
education bureaucracy and w ants
to leave the state treasury flush.
“I ju st w ant to m ake sure that
w e d o n’t leave any tim e bom bs,
that w e d o n ’t leave any problem s
fo r th e next a d m in istra tio n ,”
E dgar said.
H e still blam es the G eneral
A ssem bly for putting the state in
the fiscal m ess he inherited seven
years ago follow ing th e bigspending days o f Gov. Jam es R.
T h o m p so n . A nd he w arned
law m akers again W ednesday to

forget any notion o f g oing on a
spending binge on feel-good bills
aim ed at curry in g fa v o r w ith
voters in November.
U ltim ately, E d g ar can try to
w ard o ff legislative attem pts to
raid the now -healthy state coffers
with his veto pen.
B ut w hat is w orking against
Edgar on other issues is his status
as a lam e-duck governor and the
heavy politics that can paralyze
the G eneral A ssem bly in a m ajor
election year.
“H e ’s playing w ith a w eaker
h a n d ,” said S en ate M in o rity
L eader Em il Jones, D -C hicago.
Even so, E dgar is dealing
w ith h ig h -p ro file issu es that
m ight set better w ith the public
than w ith law m akers.

of
educating elem entary and high

To Edgar, the argum ent is
clear. The governor is the state’s
ch ief executive, and he should be
directly responsible for the m ost
im portant issu e in Illin o is —
educating children.
Currently, the State B oard of
Education enjoys som e at least

Before he left the podium ,
E dgar also began setting the table
for the next governor - and a new

G eneral A ssem bly — to address
the b ig g est p ro b lem h e has
failed to fix: the sta te ’s o ver
reliance on property taxes to fund
public schools.
L ast year, th e G en eral
A ssem bly approved raising taxes
on riverboat casinos, cigarettes
and telephone calls to pum p m ore
m oney into schools.
E ven so, E d g ar called for a
com m ission to study how to shift
the burden o f paying for public
schools onto the incom e tax or
som e other tax d eem ed fairer
than the property taxes.
“T he current system rem ains
unfair,” E dgar said. “W e need to
change it.”
M adigan, w ho has supported
E d g ar’s school funding efforts,
said law m ak ers lo st a g reat
o p p o rtu n ity
to c h a n g e
the
system w hen R epublicans balked
last spring.
“It still can b e d o n e ,”
M adigan said. “M uch o f that w ill

Houk said that one of the

Jim L eonis, the o ffic e’s
executive director, said he
doesn’t know why the beautiful
gatew ay city h asn ’t m ade more
appearances on the big screen.
“It seems to m e that St.
Louis, being the great city that it
is, would attract a greater num ber
o f film m ak ers,” L eonis said.
“Hopefully, w ith our office out
there actively w orking to bring
those m ovies in, w e’ll see more
movies. We have a lot o f great
locations here. It’s a beautiful old
city
and
the
surrounding
countryside and sm all tow ns are
diverse.”
Currently, there are no major

slated for

given the interest and enthusiasm
shown at last w eek’s presentation

Missouri Historical Society hosted
a St. Louis film retrospective
■ BY STEPHEN WHITE
L IF E S T Y L E REPO RTER

Brian C hristopher is an athlete
w ith
th e
W orld
W restling
F ed era tio n (W W F ). He w ill
w restle Taka M ichinoku fo r the
lig h t h e a v y w e ig h t belt F riday
n ig h t at the K iel C e n ter in
dow ntow n St. Louis.

How did you get involved
with this whole wrestling thing?
I grew up in M em phis and it’s
real big there.

W here did you
before the WWF?

wrestle

I w restled in a league called
the USW A and th a t’s w here all
the big guys got started, Jerry
L aw ler, R an d y S avage, H ulk
H ogan...

Who trained you?
N obody trained me.

You ju st jum ped into the
ring, huh? How old are you?
I do n ’t like to give my age.

Okay. So, were there a lot of
egos when you joined the
WWF?
Yeah, there w ere. But they had
to deal w ith m y ego w hich is
bigger because I am the best.

It seem s like wrestling has
become more popular in the
last year. W hy do you think that
is?
W restlin g has alw ays been
popular. It’s ju s t that the two m ain
leaguers, W W F and WCW, have
ju s t b een co m p etin g heavier.
E ven though the W C W m ay get
som e bigger ratings, they aren ’t
w orld-w ide like the WWF.

They haven’t even been here
for years. So, now y o u ’re
com peting
for
the
light
heavyw eight
cham pionship.
Are you adding any new moves
to your repertoire?
I ’m w orking on a new one

called the slobberknocker. I ’m
g onna
g iv e
th a t to
T aka
M ichinoku.

What kind of strategies are
you working on for the match?
I d o n ’t need any strategies for
him. H e ’s not even A m erican.
H e’s from Japan or som ething.
A nd w e all know that A m ericans
are sm arter than the Japanese.

We do?
Yes, w e do. I d o n ’t think the
m atch w ill last m ore than five
minutes.

How do you keep from
getting nervous in front of
thousands of people?
They get nervous w hen they
see me. A ll the pim ply faced girls
start scream ing fo r me and the
skinny w ussy guys are all jealous
o f me.

Is there any kind o f move
you wouldn’t want to take?
T aka
M ich in o k u
has
so m eth in g c a lle d th e Taka
M ichinoku driver. I w ould not
w ant to get hit w ith that.

What do you think of the
little wrestlers? It’s not PC to
call them midgets anymore.
I think th e y ’re funny. T hey can
do a lot o f m oves th at other
w restlers c a n ’t do because th e y ’re
so small.

If given the opportunity, how
many would you take on at
once?
I w ould take on as m any as
they could send. I ’d stom p them
and m ake m idget wine.

Good luck in your match in
St. Louis.
T hanks, but I d o n ’t need any.

C arrie H ouk said that one o f
the great attributes o f St. L ouis in
film m aking is that it can double
fo r several other cities. She also
m entioned that the city w orks
q u ite w ell fo r p erio d p ieces,
b ecause o f its architecture and
m any historical landm arks. But
v ery few m o v ies h av e been
film ed entirely in St. Louis, so
life in St. L o u is is seldom
d e p ic te d on th e b ig screen.
M onum ents like the A rch, the
E ads B ridge and U nion Station
m ake fo r p retty p ic tu res in

A lth o u g h H ouk w as not

“I t’s a beautiful m ovie,” H ouk
said. “N o t m any p eo p le have
