Students, faculty and staff who are planning to purchase
parking stickers for the 1996-97 school year may want to bring
a little m ore cash if the new price increases are approved by the
C hancellor and the B oard of Trustees.
A t Friday’s student senate m eeting, the Traffic and Safety
C om m ittee unveiled a plan they have approved that would
increase parking sticker prices up to $35 next year and as much
as $30 the following year, depending on the price of the actual
project.
Bob Vanzo, director of Adm inistrative Services, stressed
that the plan is still in its prelim inary stages and that it still has
to go through other channels before it is approved.
“President (Ted) Sanders will get the paperw ork tom orrow
for approval and then it will be sent to the B oard of Trustees for
their decision,” Vanzo said.
T he reason for the large increase in sticker prices is that the
com m ittee decided to follow a plan that would pay for the
parking lot renovations by selling bonds so that the parking lots
could be renovated all at one time.

Talent show kicks off series of events for Family Weekend
By David Weil
News Reporter
The Residence Hall Program m ing Com m ittee presented S IU E ’s
first residential talent show Friday, Feb. 9 at 9:00 PM in the m ulti­
function room in the Residence Hall as part of S IU E ’s Family
Weekend.
The event was m onitored by Kara Shustrin, a housing coordinator
from University Housing, with Michelle C alander and Alix-Ann
Roland acting as the chairpersons and emcees for the evening.
There were no winners and losers: the event was a show of talent,
not a com petition. Bonnie Laleman, whose son Joel participated in
the show, said that she felt the show was “real nice, th ere’s a lot of
talent here.”
A bout a dozen acts entertained the crowd of over one hundred
parents and students in attendance.
The evening started out with a trio of original com positions by a
band called Moonshine. Seth H orton, M ark Fransisco and Joel
Lalem an of the R esidence Hall led the band which will be
appearing at B ern ard ’s Pub on Laclede’s Landing on Feb. 17.
The stage was then cleared for the first of several acoustic guitar
perform ances of the night. John Falasz slowed down the pace with
an acoustic version of “The H ouse of the Rising Sun.” Hall resident
Lisa Buffa then sang her rendition of the Oasis hit “W onderwall”
with a guitar accom panim ent by local guitarist D am on A nderson.
G uitars were not the only focus of the evening when Michelle
C alander left her duties as em cee to sing her solo version of “When
I Fall in Love.”

State and Local------------------------------------------------Utility defends itself against allegations
Illinois Power Co. is defending itself against allegations that it has been
butchering trees when trimming around electric lines.
Some residents contend that IP crews and private contractors hired by the
utility have been too aggressive in their tree trimming, leaving ugly, abnormally
shaped trees.

Woman wins civil suit over plane crash
SPARKS, Nev. (AP)—A jury has awarded $115,000 to a Sparks woman who
lost her personal possessions when a small plane crashed into her condo 15
months ago. The Washoe District Court jury awarded Jane Brimmer $40,000 for
personal property loss and $75,000 for the emotional distress she suffered.
Brimmer sued pilot Henry Goff of Lake Oswego, Ore., Keys Family Ltd. and
Interwest Financial Group after the crash destroyed the Sparks condo where she
lived. The defendants denied any liability.
Goff was trying to land at Reno Cannon International Airport when he
reported the plane lost power. He tried to make a forced landing, but the plane
struck a pole and then the M erchant Street duplex.

International------------- ---------------------------------------

The alternative to this plan would be to raise the price $10
each year for five years. With this plan, the parking lots would
be w orked on in three different phases.
If the proposed bond package is approved there will not be
another sticker increase for the next 13 years.
C onstruction could begin as soon as May 1997 if the plan is
approved by the B oard of Trustees.
Parking lot renovations would take place at the campuses in
Edwardsville, East St. Louis and A lton, and the renovations
would not be isolated to just resurfacing parking lots.
Vanzo said th at th e construction w ould involve
im provem ents on lighting and road intersections and the
installation of em ergency phones.
Not everybody was entirely happy about the proposed fee
increases. Fabian Wright, vice president of the student senate,
was angered at the plan.
“I am n o t only upset b u t appalled th at because the
university has m ism anaged our funds, they are considering
such an astronom ical increase on parking decals,” he said. “A
plan was just approved, by both the student senate and the
B oard of Trustees, for a $10 a year increase over a five year
period—a proposition that d idn’t have my support.”
Wright went on to say that he will m ake sure that the issue
will not go on unnoticed by the student body.
“This is a serious issue that I will ensure students are aware
of. I may be willing to consider the proposal if students were in
some way benefiting.” Wright said. “However, they are asking
students to pay $55 to walk a half mile to class regardless of the
w eather.”

IRA claims responsibility for London bombing
LO N D O N (A P )—The Irish Republican Arm y claimed responsibility
Saturday for a London bombing, and police searching through the wreckage
found the bodies of two newspaper vendors—the first confirmed deaths in the
attack.
The Friday evening bombing in a business district broke a 17-month-old IRA
cease-fire and diminished hopes that a durable peace in Northern Ireland was
near. A t least 36 people were injured, six seriously.

T h e

Two years ago the university
changed from Pepsi to Coke
without any input or opinions
from the students. In the spring
of 1995, the Traffic and Safety
Com m ittee appeared before
the student senate and
presented a plan to raise funds
for the repair of the school
parking lots.
The plan proposed that the
Commentary
school would raise sticker fees
$10 a year for the next 6 years,
By Lenon Maguire
bringing the final cost of a red
sticker to $70. They also
wanted to do away with the
free parking lot, leaving the students with no open parking.
The senate told the com m ittee in very clear term s that the
students they talked to did not approve of these changes. The
com m ittee voted for the changes anyway.
This past fall, when students com plained about raised fees,
the Traffic and Safety C om m ittee replied that they had
brought the plan in front of the student senate. They failed to
m ention, however, that the senate opposed the plan.
Now the Traffic and Safety C om m ittee has a new plan.
They want to raise the price of parking stickers $65 m ore for
next year. This m eans that a red sticker would be at least $85.
If the raise is a flat rate for all parking stickers, then parking
in the green lot or the V adalabene C enter lot would cost $125.
This is ridiculous.
The com m ittee says that the m oney is needed for the
repairs of the parking lots. I agree with them that the red lots
are in need of repair. These were not the first lots w orked on
this year, however. The pay lot and the green lot were the first
lots to be repaired. If the red lots are in such poor condition,
then why w eren’t they worked on first?
I am usually broke, as many college students are. I had
trouble coming up with $13 for a book required for a class this
semester. If I do n ’t have $13, then w here am I going to find
the money for an $85 parking sticker? If I don’t have the
money for a sticker, then I probably w on’t have m oney for the
pay lot or parking m eters either.
This proposed increase has not yet gone into effect o r been
voted on. If enough students speak out, m aybe the com mittee
w on’t raise the fees. Call either Ken N eher at 692-2536 or
Nick Adams at 692-3728 and tell them that you are opposed
to the fee increases. Nick A dam s is on the com m ittee and Ken
Neher' is the Vice Chancellor. If you are against a raise in fees,
then these m en need to be aware of how you feel. Call and let
them know. Call m ore than once. Tie up the phones all day if
you have to. O r stop by their offices. Nick Adam s is in the
Student Fitness C enter and Ken N eher is in the Rendlem an
Building. Give them your opinion.
T here is also a petition being passed around campus. Look
for it in class or stop by the Student G overnm ent office in the
Kimmel Leadership C enter and sign it there. If you don’t want
fee increases for the fall, you have to do som ething now.

letter to the editor.

You can't always say what you
mean and mean what you say
I’m writing in response to Fabian W right’s
letter about our “racist” 16th president. L et’s
talk about politicians for a second.
Have you ever heard of a politician who said
one thing and then did another?
A lot of times politicians have different
motives behind their speeches. However, they
know what the people want to hear. T h at’s how
they win support.
I d o n ’t know exactly what Lincoln was
thinking. Maybe he wanted to free the slaves,
and the only way he could justify doing so was
to say it would preserve the union.
A t the time when many people were p ro ­
slavery, how would they respond to an anti­
slavery president?
Lincoln was able to free the slaves, no
m atter how he got it accomplished. Lincoln
was able to free the slaves, no m atter how he

got it accom plished. T h at is w hat good
politicians do.
Now, you claim to know what Lincoln’s
intentions and thoughts were. Let me ask your
age for a second.
If you are not over 130 years old and haven’t
talked to Lincoln, you have no way of knowing
what he was thinking.
A re you? I think not.
D o you think Lincoln cared about the slaves
so little that he would risk and actually lose his
life for that decision?
I can’t say either, since I have not conversed
with him. B ut take w hat I said to heart.
Sometim es you have to say what you d o n ’t
m ean in order to get what you want and know
is right.

Soph., Business

D arryl H o w le tt— Jo b well done
I would like to com m end you on the inspirational messages you sent in your editorials in
the Feb. 1,1996 issue of the Alestle. It is very refreshing to read such positive com m entary
on such serious issues as the state of Black Am erica and male and female relationships. Not
only do I comm end you on your comments, but you flair for writing is impeccable.
I found you com m ents honest, straightforw ard, and based on facts. I certainly hope your
messages were widely received and that the recipients will take heed. In addition, 1 hope
others were as affected by your words as I was and that they will share your thoughts with
others. It is not often that I agree with or respond to everything that I read, but 1 was so
inspired that I felt the urge to comment.
I encourage you to “keep the faith” and to keep up the good work. Success to you with
your future endeavors, for I think you will go far in the field of journalism .
Cheryl Y. Heard
Asst. Director o f Kimmel Leadership Center
E ditor’s note: The Alestle sta ff appreciates any kind o f response to articles or commentaries
written, good or bad. We are in the business to present news and com mentary that best suits
our campus community. When we receive positive feedback, we understand that we are doing
something good fo r SIU E and its community. We thank everyone in their efforts to m ake us a
stronger, more responsible newspaper.

letter to the editor__________________________________________________________________

A couple of quick thoughts
from out in radio land
I do not understand why the Alestle would devote m ore than a full page to a couple of racist
fools who think it’s cute to use the “N ” word on the air. W hat can we look forw ard to next week—
a cheery feature on the Ku Klux Klan, com plete with thanks for a “great interview ?”
I was beginning to think the Campus Puritan had gone into retirem ent until I saw his letter in
Thursday’s paper about WSIE.
W hile I do not entirely disagree with him, I do think W SIE would be ill-advised to m ake any
drastic shift away from a form at that is predom inantly jazz. W SIE has developed a national
reputation as an outstanding jazz station, and this surely brings positive recognition to SIU E and
enhances the university’s reputation and “nam e recognition.”
John Farley
Professor of Sociology

In last Thursday’s edition of the Alestle, there were a few spelling mistakes
that found their way onto our pages. The mistakes were not those of the
authors, but those of the Alestle staff. We apologize to the authors for any
em barrassm ent we might have caused them. In the future we will be more
careful in transferring the letters to the editor to the editorial page.

The guitars came back before intermission,
however, when Rich Williams produced a fine
solo version of the Goo Goo Dolls’ single
“Nam e.”
A fter an intermission featuring soft drinks
and cookies for parents and students, the
mood was still jovial when Beth Seely did her
impression of a hum an pretzel and Lisa Buffa
displayed her ability to drink soda from a can
without opening it.
A nother highlight of the show was
provided next when Tiona & Co. lip-synced
and danced their way through a sm ooth

D am on A nderson then retook the stage
with his acoustic guitar to sing two original

Alpha Kappa Alpha to distribute condoms on Valentine’s Day
By David Weil
News Reporter
On Valentine’s Day the A lpha K appa A lpha
sorority will d istribute free condom s and
inform ation about Sexually Transm itted Diseases
(STDs) in the G oshen Lounge of the University
C enter from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
T he event coincides with National Condom Day,
sponsored by the A m erican Social H ealth
Association (A SH A ).
The day is intended to enlighten sexually active
students about the dangers of unprotected sex.
“P rotecting yourself d o esn ’t m ean giving up

sexual pleasure; it just m eans finding ways to have
sex m ore safely,” according to ASHA.
Protection against STDs is increasingly im portant
in a world where an estim ated 55 million Am ericans
have STDs. New infections are reported at a rate of
12 million per year with two-thirds of new infections
occurring in people under 25.
The difficulty in recognizing many of the STDs
leads to further spread of disease, according to
A SH A President Peggy Clarke.
“Because so many STDs have very mild
symptoms o r no symptoms at all, an infected person
can transm it a disease w ithout being aware of the
infection,” Clarke said.

Knowledge and com m unication are the keys to
avoiding STDs, according to C larke who stated, “It
is crucial that sex partners talk openly about the
sensitive subject of sexual health and use condom s to
p ro tect one a n o th er from sexually tran sm itted
diseases.”
In addition to the health benefits, C larke also sees
condom usage as a way to relieve som e of the
tension and uncertainty from a relationship. By
using condom s, couples are able to relax w ithout the
fear of disease, “and open com m unication about
sexual health can lead to greater intimacy.”
F or confidential inform ation about STDs call

(A P) Though the num ber is dropping, m ore than half of college freshm en in A rkansas have
to take rem edial classes in m ath, English o r reading.
O f the state’s 14,200 college freshm en enrolled in the fall sem ester last year, 58 percent of
them were enrolled in rem edial courses.
Enrollm ent num bers indicate that stronger admission standards at the state’s four-year
colleges are causing some of those students to begin college work at two-year campuses,
which have open admissions.
“It’s less expensive to educate a student at a two-year college. We d o n ’t w ant them to be total
rem edial institutions, but it is less expensive,” said E d Crowe, state D epartm ent of Higher
Education senior associate director.
A state D epartm ent of Higher E ducation report shows th at last fall 34.9 percent of the
students in A rkansas public colleges had to take rem edial English, 52.3 percent were enrolled
in rem edial m ath, and 31.3 percent took rem edial reading.
This fall, the num bers declined slightly, with 33.7 percent taking English rem ediation, 51.3
percent rem edial math, and 27.1 percent reading.
Enrollm ent num bers fell this year along with rem ediation rates.
Crowe said he expects the num ber of students who need rem ediation after high school to
continue to decline because of improving high school core curriculum requirem ents.
A bout 63 percent (4,351 out of 6,940 students) who entered college in 1993 and took
rem ediation continued their education after the first year, Crowe said. A bout 68 percent
(9,592 out of 14,065) of all freshm an who entered college in 1993 continued their education,
Crowe said. M ore than 60 percent of students who take rem ediation courses stay in school,
Crowe said.
A bout one-third of all college students nationally require rem edial courses, Crowe said.
“If you accept a student, the institution has an obligation to m ake them successful,” Crowe
said.
The University of A rkansas at Fayetteville has the strongest admission standards of public
colleges and universities in the state and the fewest rem edial students, Crowe said.
E nrollm ent at four-year public universities dropped 1.9 percent, while two-year public
colleges and private schools showed increased enrollm ent. Two year-college enrollm ent
increased 7.6 percent, and private schools grew by 2.5 percent.
E nrollm ent at two two-year schools increased by m ore than 40 percent: 43.4 percent at MidSouth Com munity College, West Memphis, and 40.3 percent at Pines Technical College in
Pine Bluff.

C O L O R A D O SPRIN GS, Colo. (A P )—
The A ir Force Academ y has released an
in tern al investigation th at concludes the
academy had no way to predict a cadet who
died last August by setting him self on fire
would harm himself.
T he cadet, David Ramsey, 20, a football
player from N o rth C aroline, ignited his
clothes and walked down a hallway engulfed
in flames last Aug. 21, just half an hour
before he was p repared to check out of the
academy after learning he was going to be
expelled. H e died six days later from severe
burns over one-third of his body.
The academy report released under the
F reedom of In fo rm ation A ct Friday
“concluded th at the circum stances under
control of A ir Force Academ y officials were
not, individually or in com bination, the cause
of Ram sey burning him self,” said Col. Joe
Purka, academy spokesman.
Ram sey’s parents said Friday they are not
surprised the academ y took no responsibility
for their son’s death.
“We kind of figured that they would come
out with a rep o rt th a t glosses over any
m istake they might have m ade,” said his
father, David Ramsey. T he family has not
decided w hether to file a lawsuit, he added.
“To be honest, we d on’t even know w here to
start.”
Ramsey had average grades, poor military
perform ance and what one officer called “an
attitude problem of significant m agnitude.”
His first real trouble began in D ecem ber
1994, after he got drunk in town, m istook
som eone else’s car for one he had borrowed,
smashed the windshield, tore up the interior
and curled up inside for warm th. The car’s
owner found him shortly after m idnight and
called police.
Ramsey becam e violent w hen the officers

attem pted to handcuff him. It took several
officers to subdue him.
It was two m onths after the drunken assault
before Ram sey went to the cadet counseling
center, which determ ined he was neither an
alcoholic nor a problem drinker, the Air
Force report said.
But Ram sey skipped all but three of the 12
alcohol counseling sessions he was ordered to
attend. No one asked why or told his
superiors.
Investigators adm it it was a “ missed
opportunity” to help Ramsey; one officer
called it “a systemic failure” in the academ y’s
alcohol treatm ent program , according to the
report. A new tracking and notification
system is now in place.
Although Ramsey violated restrictions by
leaving cam pus, and was kicked out of
survival training because of a “firecracker
incident,” academ y officials w ere not
w orried, the report said. In fact, they sent
Ramsey on a strenuous overseas training
program that summer, saying his behavior
seem ed normal.
On July 27, Ramsey cracked up after a night
of heavy drinking at an air base in Japan.
A fter this “departure from reality” he was
airlifted to a m ental hospital at a California
air base and released after five days, the
report said.
O n the day R am sey re tu rn ed to the
academy he was inform ed he probably would
be expelled for psychosis and alcoholism, the
report said.
Investigators said R am sey appeared
relieved there would be no court m artial and
was eager to leave the academy.
Academ y officials said there was no reason
to put R am sey under close supervision
because at least three military psychiatrists
said he was not a threat to himself or others.

“A cyborg placed on this
earth to torment me/'

Tuesday, February 13, 1996

ST. LO U IS (A P )—A ttorney G eneral Janet R eno says federal
prosecutors can seek the death penalty against a man accused
of carjacking in the abduction of two W ashington University
students last spring.
A ndre Bonds, 20, Richm ond Heights, is scheduled to go on
trial May 6 in U.S. D istrict C ourt here.
T he death-penalty authorization is the first for federal
prosecutors here, U.S. A ttorney Edw ard L. Dowd Jr. said
Friday. The death penalty for carjacking was part of the 1994
crime bill.
F ederal p ro secutors m ay ask for Justice D ep artm en t
approval to seek the death penalty in carjackings in which a
victim is killed. Bonds also is charged in St. Louis Circuit Court
with m urder and rape in an attack on the two students.
B onds’ co-defendant, Bryan Cook, is not charged in the
federal case.
A uthorities believe that Bonds fatally shot Melissa Gail
A ptm an, 22, of Miami, and raped her 20-year-old friend after
Bonds and Cook abducted the women May 5 near a restaurant
in the Dogtown neighborhood.
Police believe that Bonds shot Aptm an when she shouted for
help. H e and C ook drove A ptm an’s Jeep C herokee to the
Washington Park area in Illinois, where Bonds raped and shot
the 20-year-old, authorities said. The younger woman was left
for dead but survived.
Cook, 17, of St. Louis, was charged in July with 10 felonies in
the attack.
Besides carjacking, Bonds is charged in federal court with two
counts of kidnapping.
Bonds’ lawyer, R ichard H. Sindel, had gone to Washington
earlier to argue with Justice D epartm ent officials against
authorizing the death penalty.
Sindel said Friday that he was unaw are of any similar case
nationw ide in which the Justice D e p artm en t w ithheld
approval.
Bonds will probably be tried on the federal charges before
standing trial in state court, Sindel said.

B A LTIM O R E (A P )—Prosecutors are far less likely to
seek the death penalty for wom en m urderers than for men,
even when the crime legally calls for it, a researcher said
Saturday.
M ore than 3,000 people are on death row in the U nited
States but only 49, or 1.6 percent, are women, said Leigh
Buchanan Bienen of the N orthw estern University School of
Law. Since U.S. executions resum ed in 1976, m ore than 300
men have been put to death, but only one woman, she said.
“It appears to be a clear case of gender discrimination. Men
can and should argue that the system discriminates against
them ,” B ienen said at the national m eeting of the Am erican
Association for the A dvancem ent of Science.
Women commit far fewer capital m urders than men and
are even less likely to face prosecution, she said.
“T here is a sense that women are m ore apt to be sinned
against than to be sinners,” Bienen said. “Also, a woman is
apt to be som ebody’s m other and that has an effect.”
A n example, she said, is Susan Smith, a women convicted
of drowning her two children in a South Carolina lake.
“Very few w anted the death penalty for Susan Smith, even
though her crime was death-eligible and there was little
sympathy for her,” Bienen said. "B y the time the trial was
over, few people w anted her executed.”
A nother researcher at the m eeting, Richard Rosenfeld of
the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the num ber of
women killed in dom estic violence declined 30 percent from
1968 to 1993. In St. Louis and Chicago, two cities he studied,
only 8 percent of all m urders involved dom estic partners. In
1970, the rate was 15 percent.
The decline in wom en killed by their partners may reflect
the growing availability of battered wom en shelters where
potential victims can be protected, Rosenfeld said. Also,
many police are now taking spousal abuse m ore seriously.
M oney also m akes a difference, he said. Because women
now are earning m ore money, they are less likely to be
trapped in a violence-prone relationship.
“W omen are now m ore economically valuable to m en,” said
Rosenfeld. “W hen men need wom en economically, they are
less apt to abuse w om en.”

Ben Harper's Tight For Your
Mind7 is a CD with character
By Lenon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
The first time I experienced Ben H arper
was when I saw him and his band open up for
Luscious Jackson at the now defunct Other
World some time ago. The show was quite
good, and I was happy to be able to review his
new album titled Fight For Your M ind. The
album is mainly a rock album , but it blends
r&b, jazz, blues, reggae and a bit of world
music.
The album is an eclectic blend of many
instrum ents. A long with the traditional
drums, bass and acoustic guitar, the album
also featu res tam boura, sarod, tabla,
H am m ond B3 organ and various percussion.
This collaboration of instrum ents produces a
very wonderful album with a unique and
distinctive sound.
Lyrically, H arp er tackles, different issues
such as non-conformity, free thinking, and
religion. In the song “People L ead” he sings
ab out questioning au th o rity and finding
answers. H arper says:
“So as long as som eone else/ controls your
history/ the truth shall remain just a m ystery/
fo r you can lead a horse to water/ but you

cannot m ake him drink./ You can put a man
through school/ but you cannot m ake him
think. ”
The highlight for me was the song “By My
Side.” H ere H arper is telling the one he loves
to stay with him and not leave: "There’s no
love like lost love/ no pain like a broken heart/
there’s no love like you and m e/ and no loss
like us apart. ”
While he sings, the H am m ond B3 organ is
beautifully playing a slow, haunting tune in
the background. It is a sham e Marvin Gaye is
dead because he would have been perfect for
this song.
The song “Power of the G ospel” features
violin, viola, and cello. The sound again goes
in an o th er direction which adds to the
already vast array of song types. H ere H arper
tells how the power of religion can effect a
person’s life: “I t ’s the eyes fo r the blind/ and
the legs fo r the lam e/ It is the love fo r hate/ and
pride fo r shame.'”
This recording covers m any areas of
musical styles. If you are looking for an album
with character and a sound not easily found in
the m ainstream , check out Fight For Your
M ind because you will not be disappointed.

Upcoming movie “Muppets Treasure Island”
will be at local theatres February 16.

February 14th: Love is in the air
B y A im é e M u ñ o z
F o r th e A le stle

St. Valentine’s Day is here, and everywhere you look “there is love in the
air” as Barry Manillow’s song suggests.
During this month of love one can see all kinds of couples being romantic.
Gifts, cards, flowers and chocolates are the order of the day.
So w hat about the people w ho d o n ’t date?
There are those w ho decides not to date because they are too busy with
school an d /o r work. Others just d o n ’t w ant to be burdened with “romantic
stuff’ or d o n ’t want to get involved in a relationship.
There are also those individuals w ho do not have that special som eone to
share Valentine’s Day with because either they can’t find a really special
person for the occasion or, simply, that no one will date them.
Single people, specifically here at SIUE, think about Valentine’s Day in
different ways—contrary to popular belief. April Smith, a 26-year-old student
majoring in advertising,
said that she doesn’t
have a boyfriend and
that it does not bother
her to spend
Valentine’s Day without
one.
“I can go out with
my friends, tell them
H appy Valentine’s Day
and have fun,” Smith
said.
W hen asked if she
had a fantasy about the
ideal Valentine’s Day
date, Smith said that
she would like for a
special guy to give her
a rose with a riddle
that she w ould have to
figure out to discover
w here they w ere going.
“Then w e would go
for a romantic picnic at
the beach, then to a
jazz club and maybe a
few cocktails,” Smith
........
said.
1 J Ü Ü iill
111
A little out of the
ordinary, as Smith
pointed out, but of
course there is always
som eone with the
Jeremy Paschall/Alestle classical date in mind.
April Smith, who is majoring in advertising, isn't
Jeannette Obeius, a
bothered about spending Valentine's Day alone.
22-year-old social work
major, says that her
fantasy date w ould be to go to a obviously expensive romantic restaurant and
drink som e cham pagne with candlelights.
For Curtis Lanoue, a 19-year-old sophom ore w ho studies music, a Cuban
w om an that he saw in a Havana café would be his fantasy date.
“I would have maybe a thousand dollars, fly dow n to Havana and spend all
the money with the girl in aim and cigars,” Lanoue said.
“For me, Valentine’s Day is not that important. This might have something
to do with the fact that I d o n ’t have a girlfriend. I didn’t celebrate last year and
I w o n ’t this year either, unless I find a thousand dollars on the street which
would take me directly to Havana,” Lanoue said.
There are other kinds of people w ho do not date— as w e know it—married
people. They already have found their Valentine’s date for the rest of their
lives.
Here at SIUE there are many married couples. One of these married people
is Benoit Gerbore, a junior in psychology and philosophy.
Cher Gerbore is the wife of the 24-year-old SIUE student. They have been
married for seven m onths a n d w ere engaged on Valentine’s Day 1995.
Gerbore explains that this was just a coincidence.
“We bought the ring together but it needed som e adjustments. It just so
happened that we got it back o n February 13, w e w ent to a nice restaurant on
the 14th and I proposed. It was kind of romantic,” Gerbore said.
“It was romantic because of the engagem ent but I didn’t celebrated
Valentine’s before. I d o n ’t pay attention to it because I think it is a celebration
about a Christian saint and I d o n ’t agree with these. Besides, I don’t want
people to tell me how I have to celebrate a day in particular. I decide what

I’m going to celebrate and when. I think last
Valentine’s was the only important one for
me because of the
engagem ent,” Gerbore
also said.
So w hat is love like for a
married couple during this
day, even if you
d o n ’t agree with it?
“I d o n ’t know what
love really is, I don’t
understand it, I
guess it is just a
word. I’m married,
but marriage and
love d o n ’t
necessarily go
together. In my case,
1 chose Cher to try
and find out what
love is,” Gerbore
said.
“As Fellini said in an interview, ‘Marriage, if it is to survive, must be treated
as the beginning not as the happy ending; it’s something you have to work at,
but it is also not the alpha and omega of hum an existence,’ and I agree with
him,” he said.
Another SIUE married couple are Jose and Anne Mingorance. Jose is a 26year-old senior who studies electrical engineering. Anne is a graduate of
Radford University in Virginia.
Jose and Anne were married on May 7,1995. They are now expecting a
baby girl due on May 12th of this year.
“Well, he proposed Christmas Day of 1994. He asked my father first while I
was putting presents away, then he w ent upstairs and asked me to marry
him ,” Anne said.
Anne explains the first time they had Valentine’s Day together in 1994: “I
was living in Spain and w ere not dating yet. Jose left a rose with my friend so
she would place it on my bed.”
“He was too em barrassed to give it in person.” Anne added.
“Last year he placed roses and chocolates in my bed again. We were living
in EdwardsviHe already. It happened the same way, but let’s see what happens
this year,” Mingorance said.
Jose said that on the three Valentine’s they have spent together nothing has
changed.
“The first Valentine’s Day I spend with som ebody was with my wife. For me
this is a special day to remind her that I love her, although I don't have to
because she already knows,” Jose said.
Now that your having a baby, is there anything different about Valentine’s
Day?
Mingorance replied, “This year we will have a private dinner and some
presents but I w on’t say the rest. Right now, nothing is different. Maybe next
year w hen w e have our girl here.”
So students both married and single celebrate Valentine’s Day in different
ways, traditions, and customs. That’s what makes the holiday so fun.

Shown here is Jose and Anne Mingorance, who got married last May. For
them, the day represents as a reminder of their love. The couple is expecting
their first child in May of this year.

Jam m in’ Jill, Pat Man, Lifeguard, Jilly
Bean, Radio Randy ... If you’re the
parent of children of just about all but
the youngest infant or the “too cool”
teenager, you may recognize these
nam es as the deejays who bring you
sounds from Planet Fun—otherwise
known as W FUN, 95.5 on the FM dial.
I listen to the Planet on my way to
and from school because I ’m outvoted
by one small but very persistent voice. I
could insist on tuning in to NPR (my

even listen to it when my kids aren’t with me.
So about the time I ’m driving down University Drive, Jilly
Bean has had the “candy store” open for several hours and is
sending “sweet sounds over the airwaves.”
But don’t m ake the same m istake one listener did. She referred
to the station as “just a kid’s station.” She was gently but firmly
admonished by Jilly Bean that “this is a family station and we try
to have something for everyone.”
The deejays do a decent job of mingling soft rock such as
Amy G rant and the Eagles with Disney songs, the Animaniacs
and Weird A1 Yankovich. Some of you may rem em ber Weird A1
as the one who brought

Saturday nights causing problems for Cougars
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor

Jerem y Paschall/A/es/Ze

The Cougars' Tim Thorsen goes high to take grab a rebound from
a Lewis player Thursday. The Cougars defeated the Flyers 89-80.

Wrestlers hang tough
against top ranked team

For the SIU E m en’s basketball team , the
1995-96 season is turning in to a tale of two
nights. Last week, the team moved their
season record for Thursday night games to 62 with an 89-80 victory over Lewiss-Then, two
nights later they lost their seventh straight
Saturday night contest and saw their overall
record for Saturday games fall to 3-8 with a
70-67 loss to W isconsin-Parkside.
By splitting the pair of games, the Cougars
overall record moved to 9-11 and 6-9 in the
G reat Lakes Valley Conference.
In Thursday’s game, the Cougars looked
to leading scorer Jason Holm es to lead them
to victory and Holmes responded with 35
points on 11 of 19 shooting from the field.
H olm es credited his hot shooting to his
going to the gym early in the day to do some
extra shooting.
C ougar H ead coach Jack M argenthaler
credited the victory to his team ’s em otional
play.
“O ur effort since the Quincy game has
been down, but tonight was much better,”
M argenthaler said.
While Holm es was successful from the
field, he was not the only Cougar to shoot
well. As a team , SIU E shot 56 percent from
the field.
“O ur shooting percentage was up because
our shot selection was good,” M argenthaler
said. “T hat’s what we need m ore of.”

Lady Cougars end
short losing streak

Assistant Sports Editor

Sports Reporter

Traveling to the University of C entral O klahom a to
take on the No. 1 ranked wrestling team in the nation,
one probably would not give the other team half a
chance.
This is what happened to the SIU E wrestling team.
They went down to Edm ond, Okla., and took on the
top ranked Broncos in the H am ilton Field House.
The Broncos did scrape by the Cougars 24-13 but
not before several SIU E wrestlers took down some
top ranked individuals.
In the 118-pound weight class Cougar sophom ore
Chris McElwee beat Keith Kizarr, who is ranked No. 3
in the nation, 9 to 7. M cElwee ups his overall record to
11-6.
Then in the 134 weight class, junior Shawn Hickey
defeated the No. 4 ranked individual in the nation of
Ryan Vratil , 9-7. The win puts Hickey at 7-3 on the
season.
A new com er this sem ester in the C ougar line-up
m ade a difference in the 167 pound weight class.
Junior Jim Czajkowski defeated Chad B eeson 15-4.
Czajkowski im proved his season record to 6-1.
Sophom ore Jason C arter continued his excellence
by winning the 190 pound weight class against Kyle
Vandruff by a score of 4-2. C arter improves to 19-8.
H ead coach Larry K ristoff liked what he saw
against the Broncos and he knows if his wrestlers keep
it up they are going to surprise som e people.
“We are trying to put together the best team we can
by regionals and we are doing so a little at a time. And
if we can get our guys healthy, we can knock some guys

The S IU E Lady Cougars cam e out of this
w eek en d ’s hom e stand with two decisive
conference victories. The first was a 70-61 victory
over the Lewis Flyers on T hursday evening,
followed by an 89-66 thrashing of W isconsinParkside on Saturday.
With Thursday’s win the Lady Cougars broke a
two game losing streak. They now sit with a 14-7
record overall and 9-6 in the G re at Lakes
Conference.
Lewis never led in Thursday’s contest which saw
Terri Evans leading the way for SIU E with 18
points. 14 of which were scored in the first half.
“I was happy to see Terri knock her shots down
on the drive,” said head coach Wendy H edberg
about her senior point guard.
The supporting cast included ju n io r Amy
Tuetken with 17 points and sophom ore Alicia
H arkins who threw in 10 in spite of missing the
second half with a broken nose.
Leslie Phillips of Pinckneyville led SIU E on the
glass with seven rebounds.
The Cougars foiled a com eback which saw the
Flyers m ake four straight baskets before time
expired.
“I was really concentrating on running our
offense and doing what we wanted to do.” said
H edberg, “I was concerned with our defense after
the first half, but I’m happy with what they did in
the second half.”
•S aturday’s gam e saw four S IU E players in
double figures as Phillips and H arkins led the pack
with 18 points apiece. The duo also com bined for 11

please see WRESTLERS, next page

Joining H olm es in double figures for
SIU E were Shaun Smoot with 14 points,
including eight free throws down the stretch
that sealed the victory, and N athan Kreke
who tallied 10.
The C ougar victory avenged a 78-49 loss
to Lewis on Dec. 18.
On Saturday, the Cougars once again
struggled through a w eekend contest.
They got off to a slow start in the game as
they had just eight points in the first nine
minutes. However, the team recovered and
by halftime, they led 28-24.
“I thought we were in good shape at
halftime, 1 thought we had regained the
m om entum ,” M argenthaler said.
H ow ever, th at was n o t the case as
Parkside came out in the second half with a
hot hand. The Rangers hit 15 of 17 shots in
the second half to take back the lead going
down the stretch.
W hen the R angers struggled from the
foul line in the final m inutes though, the
Cougars had a chance to push the game into
overtim e, but H olm es’ three-point shot with
10 seconds left on the clock was off the mark
and the Rangers grabbed the rebound to
insure the victory.
“W hen we do n ’t shoot well, we aren’t a
very good basketball team ,” M argenthaler
said in regards to his team shooting 44
percent in the game. H e also expressed
concern over his team shooting 61 percent

rebounds and four steals. Terri Evans had 16 points
and B eth Brown tallied 13 in the 23-point win.
The Lady Cougars trailed at half time by three
points to the 3-11 Parkside club, but SIU E turned it
on in the second half out-scoring their opponent 5225.

.Commentary.

S ti Savoie
Well fans, after a long tim e away from
doing the com m entary thing(I’m sure you
missed me) I found som ething that compelled
me to write another stimulating piece-the
NBA All-Star weekend.
While taking in all the festivities that
accompany this trem endously hyped up
weekend, I have come up with a couple of
changes that I believe need to be made.
First, get rid of the slam -dunk com petition.
It is impossible for players to come up with
anything original anym ore and they have to
do dunks that w e’ve seen before like jum ping
from the free throw line. I d o n ’t m ean to take
anything away from B rent Barry, but Doc
invented that dunk, M ichael perfected it and
now Barry ran it into the ground. E nough is
enough already. L et’s just have a dunk contest
for the mascots and leave it at that.
W hat can the NBA replace the dunk
contest with? How about a four m an game of
horse. A fter all, we all loved the M cD onalds’
commercials with M ichael and Larry. Now we
could bring them to life.
I can just see it now, Michael, Magic,
Reggie M iller and Sir Charles all com peting in
a friendly game of horse with no dunks
allowed. Now that would be fun to watch.
Come on Com missioner Stern, let’s m ake
All-Star Saturday m ore fun.
Next, I turn my attention to the game itself
and the biggest joke of this year’s contest, the
MVP voting.
First of all, why do the sportsw riters have
to vote for the gam e’s m ost valuable player
after the third quarter. A fter all, isn’t the
fourth qu arter supposed to be crunch time
and the time when the big players are
supposed to step forward. Besides, how long
does it take to vote, do they really need a
whole quarter.
The problem with this current system was
never m ore apparent then this year. L et’s look
at the stats.
Shaquille O ’Neal: 28 minutes, 10-16 FGs, 25
points, 10 rebounds and two blocks, one facial
served up to The Adm iral David Robinson.
Michael Jordan: 22 minutes, 8-11 FGs, 20
points, four rebounds.
So the games M VP had to be Shaq right,
the stats clearly show he was the m ore
dom inant player. Even E ditor in C hief Roy
Gilmore, the biggest Jordan fan in the world,
agrees with me on this one, but the
sportswriters w ent with Jordan.
Well, the problem is that with the voting

“rfit-S tan ovee/ie*td'
system currently used, Shaq’s num bers were
lost because he got many of them in the
fourth quarter, after the voting was done. Or,
m aybe it was just because it was M ichael’s
first A ll-Star game since his return and the
league wanted to give him a welcome back
present. If th at’s the case, then they might as
well hand Magic next year’s MVP award right
now.
Once again Mr. Stern, a change is needed.
My final recom m endation to Mr. Stern
involves the way the All-Star coaches are
chosen. Currently, the coach whose team .has
the best record in each conference at the AllStar break gets to coach that conference’s AllStar team.
This poses problem s when that coach takes
the opportunity to give his players rest while
playing the players of team s they are
com peting with and sending them into the
second half of the season worn down.
I’m not saying that Bulls’ coach Phil
Jackson had this in mind Sunday when he
rested Jordan the entire fourth quarter and
played Shaq and Penny, but it does give a
coach the possibility of such action.
Why don’t they allow the coach of the team
with the worst record in the conference coach
the All-Stars. A fter all they don’t care about
the players from team s at the top and it would
also give them the chance to coach a good
team.
B etter yet, why don’t they bring in
honorary coaches like Dr. J, Larry Bird, Bill
Russel to coach. It’s not like you have to be a
regular NBA coach to coach an All-Star team.
This would also give the game a m ore
traditional flavor.
Finally, one positive thing I got from the
All-Star game and that is the passing of the
NBA torch. M aybe Jordan receiving the M VP
trophy was as good a sign as any of the wave
of veterans(Jordan, Magic, Barkley, Malone,
Ewing, Drexler, etc.) that will soon be out of
the league and the new talent that will take
over the flame and carry it into the next
century(Shaq, Penny, Kidd, Kemp, Hill,
Payton, etc.).
M aybe the writers realized that at 24, Shaq
will have m any m ore chances for the award,
while the 32-year-old Jordan’s days are
limited, and the trophy wasn’t a welcome back
present after all, but a thank you present for
all he’s done for the game.
Jordan offered the trophy to Shaq after the
game, m aybe it was m ore than just the trophy
he was looking to pass on.

off,” Kristoff said in his office
Monday afternoon.
The C entral O klahom a
match started to get out of
hand w hen the Cougars
dropped three straight weight
classes in a row.
The Cougars were leading
after three meets, 6 to 3. That
is when the down fall started.
D ropping the next three, they
then split with the Broncos in
the final four matches.
The Cougars gave a good
effort in the contest, but fell
just short of the upset. But
Kristoff is still pleased with
where they are at, going into
regional action.
“W hen our 118 pound guy
knocked off the nations No. 3
player ... and Shawn (Hicky)
beating the No. 4 ranked
player, again in the nation and
not locally, we have a good
shot going into regionals,”
Kristoff said.
