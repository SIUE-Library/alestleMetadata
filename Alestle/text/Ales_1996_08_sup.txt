What they didn’t tell you about college
by melanie adams
editor in chief
F irst off, I would like to welcome
all of you to SIUE. Whether you are
a f ir s t year s tu d e n t, ju s t
graduating from high school or
you’re a tra n s fe rrin g /re tu rn in g
student you are about to embark
on a wonderful adventure called the
great college experience. As I am
sure you all are aware of there is a
lo t you need to know before you
embark on your journey. There are
some things, t h a t your parents,
advisors and friends didn’t tell you.
For example....
You don’t have to attend
every class
Contrary to the restrictio ns in
high school, it is okay to skip class.
A fte r all, you’re the ones paying fo r
your education. However, I wouldn’t
advise doing it to o often, since
many teachers lim it your number of
absences to three; a fte r three
lowers your grade a le tte r grade.
But, if you’re lucky and you end up
with an in s tru c to r who doesn’t
take attendance, by all means skip
a few classes. It’s your life and your
choice!
You don’t have to rush into
picking a major
It is okay to enter college and
have no idea what you want to do,
deciding what you want to do the
re st of your life is a big decision.
Take your tim e to consider what it
is you would be happiest doing, and
take a couple of intro classes to it.
Your best bet, if you really are
unsure, and if you pick a major you
thought you would like and didn’t,
change it. There is nothing wrong
with changing your mind. A t least
one in every four stu d e n ts change
th e ir m ajor th ro u g h o u t th e ir
college career. The key to finding
the perfect major is to experiment.
Take classes in subjects you are
interested in and if you are a t the
point in your academic career when
you absolutely m ust pick a major,
the Career Development Center can
be very helpful in assisting you in
finding a major t h a t utilizes all of
your skills.
There is more to college
than classes
As you soon will learn, there is
more to college life than attending
classes
and
g e ttin g
good
grades.There is a whole wor\d o u t
there fo r you to explore and you
should go exploring. The formula to
succeeding in college is academic

involvement + extra curricu la r
involvement.
Find an organization on campus
t h a t is interesting to you and th a t
you can g e t involved in. There are
to n s o f them a t SIUE to choose
from.
The more involved you are on
campus, th e stronger your voice
can become on how it is run.
■Managing your time wisely

can be vital
With
all
o f th e
classes,
organizations and jobs t h a t we
hold during our college career,
managing our tim e wisely is
essential. If you want to finish in
four years or if you want to finish
w ithout suffering from a nervous
breakdown, learn t o prioritize. If you
have
tro u b le
keeping
or
remembering a schedule, make an
investm ent and purchase a planner
to w rite down when and where you
have to be. You will be spending a
little money, but what you will be
saving is
something even more
valuable... your time.
Budget your money wisely
For many entering college, the
issue o f money will be a problem.
You are used to being given what
you need and using your paychecks
fo r frivolities — clothes, CD’s and
magazines. However, when you live
on your own, having to pay fo r
groceries, insurance, re n t and
clothing all begins to add up very
quickly.
Your $100 paycheck which used
to look so grand begins to look
small a fte r all your expenses are
paid and you begin to get a little
b it panicky as to what to do....
What you should do is budget your
money.
Figure o u t how much you will
spend fo r an average month a t
school; w hat your insurance, rent,
food or miscellaneous will c o s t and
then compare th is to the amount
of money you make in a month. If
your expenditures add up to more
than your income, it is tim e to
either c u t down on what you are
spending or get a b e tte r job. If your
expenditures are equal or less than
your income then you have a good
budget to follow.
Although, you do have to follow
th is budget once you create it.
Which means you have to control
yourself and not overspend. When
you see something t h a t you want,
fo r example a $ 5 0 0 watch, ask
yo u rse lf if th is purchase is
som ething t h a t you absolutely

need, and then if the answer is yes
then purchase it. Thinking before
you buy and sticking to a s e t
budget will ease your financial bind
in college.
Sometimes cracking open the
book can be a wise move
I am not going to lie to you. There
are some courses in college th a t
your books can be b e tte r used as
ta b le legs th a n in s tru c tio n a l
m aterial, b u t these courses
u n fo rtu n a te ly are few and fa r
between, which means a LOT of

into one big blur. Your body needs to
revitalize its e lf and th e best way to
do t h a t is by sleeping.
If you have a break in your
schedule or a long lunch break, take
a nap fo r a few minutes. There are
plenty of places on campus to kick
up your fe e t and relax fo r a few
minutes.
A fte r your nap, your mind will be
clearer and you will be able to face
the re s t of your grueling day a t
school,
work,
church,
home,
meetings....

Top ten discoveries of the college experience
1 0 . My parents were rig h t.
9 . Drinking th e n ig h t before a t e s t is n o t wise.
3 . Saving is good, spending is bad.

7 . I really do have to read th e book to pass th e class.
0 . Living a t home is n o t as bad as i t seems.
5 . I do m iss my family.
4 . I don’t know everything.
3 . I am becoming ju s t like my parents.

2 . Sleep? W hat is sleep?
1. Pass on th e bubbling purple s t u f f a t th e mixer.

reading fo r you.
According to many academic
advisors, a stu d e n t is supposed to
study two and a half hours fo r
every hour you are in class.
With our busy schedules as
stu d e n ts ,
employees,
fam ily
members and everything else we do
to get by, yeah, right.
Some people can s tu d y five
minutes and know the material,
others it take hours. Know your
study habits, form some good ones
early and please, fo r your parents’
sake, read your book every once in a
while, even if it is ju s t fo r a laugh.
Take naps
As you will soon find out, if you
don’t know already, COLLEGE LIFE
is TIRING. And when it comes to
c u ttin g som ething o u t o f your
schedule to make tim e fo r everyone
and everything on it, sleep is
usually the fir s t to go.
Power naps are im p o rta n t in
college. A fte r all-nighters, juggling
work and trudging from lecture to
lecture, everything begins to blend

G et to know people on campus
College can be a serious chunk of
tim e o u t of your life. And often
tim e s th e people you m eet in
college end up being some people
t h a t a ffe c t your life in very
s ig n ific a n t ways. You will be
spending a lm o s t fo u r to eight
years of your life here so why not
make it enjoyable. .Get to know
people on cam pus and in your
classes. It will make fo r a be tte r
college experience, I guarantee it.
Have fun, but not too much fun
Okay, so now you’re finally o u t of
high school and o u t on your own,
your parents can’t control you
anymore because now your an
ADULT. You can sleep in if you want
to, you can p a rty till you puke and
you can
spend money like i t ’s
water, but remember, you’re here fo r
a reaeon. ..to g e t an education.
You can have as much fun a s you
want, but there is always a price.
(And a hefty one a t th a t, with as
much money as we’re shelling out
fo r school these days, i t ’s a wonder
they are not requiring our f ir s t born
as p a rt of th e paym ent plan!)

1996 3 5 5 G / 9

A look at what’s in, what’s out, what’s new
By Darryl Hewlett
News Editor

“The purpose fo r the renovations is to upgrade the dining and seating
area. It will look very much like Center Court when finished. It will also have
the same kind of lighting configuration as Center Court,” \Nard said.
(Alestle May 22nd issue).
Other changes t h a t the Cougar Den now has is a new walkway and
restrooms.
Some controversy has come with the next change. J u s t la s t month the
Office of Information Technology changed th e local calling area fo r
students living in Tower Lake and the Residence Hall. OIT and University
Housing sent a memo to all stu d e n ts residing in university housing the
f ir s t week in July explaining the reason fo r the change.
It s ta te d t h a t prior to 1991, all Tower Lake resident were only
perm itted local access to the c ity of Edwardsville and Collinsville north of
ln te rsta te .7 0 . A t the request of students, the University extended the
wide-calling area fo r residential stu d e n ts effective July 1,1991.... In recent
audit findings, the University discovered t h a t local calls made by
students were exceeding the am ount students pay through th e ir leases
fo r telephone charges(Alestle July 10st issue).

There have been several changes a t 5IUE th is summer. So the following
is a breakdown of what’s new— and what’s old.
First of all, the m ost obvious change on campus is the new busing
system. Madison County Transit began busing fo r the university on the
firs t of July. Earlier th is summer, Vice Chancellor of Adm inistration Ken
Neher gave his thoughts on the new busing system.
“We’re p re tty excited about this. These buses are fully handicapped
accessible. And the off-campus busing will allow students to go up and
down (Route) 159 where all the stores are and surrounding communities,”
Neher said (Alestle May 2 9 th issue). However, many students would like
to point o u t th a t there are some setbacks— mainly the fa c t th a t the
buses only make particular stops.
The university also has implemented a sexual harassm ent policy and
procedures. The policy provides fo r a sexual harassm ent com mittee made
up of 12 individuals who are nominated by the director of Human
Relations. The director receives the names from th e president of the
student body, s ta ff senate and fa cu lty senate, in addition to the four
vice-chancellors.
Another change will be advisors fo r each building on campus who will
a tte m p t to help resolve sexual harassm ent problems before they reach a
point where legal action might have to be taken. Any unresolved problems
will then be referred to th e Human Relations office. The office will conduct
and investigation and a report will be made to a rotating com m ittee from
the panel of twelve (Alestle June 5 th issue).
Another change th is year is our own Cougar Den. With new renovations
the facility will add more space fo r social gatherings fo r the upcoming
year. And despite the eating establishm ent will decline in number of people
who can eat it has other items to offer. A s s is ta n t University Center
Director Lyle Ward described the new changes.

Other Changes to Campue Include:
• University Center’s Union S ta tio n is now under Pining
Services. More grocery item s will be sold.
' '

'

>'

• The inform ation/ID center will end its present site. The
information center will remain inside o f th e University Center.
The ID center will move t o th e Enrollment Center in the
Rendleman building.
• No open parking between sem ester and holiday breaks.

You are new to the university and suddenly there’s a place or number
th a t you are not familiar with. How do you get help? Who are you gonna
call? Surely, not Ghostbusters. The answer to your problem is located
on the firs t floor of the University Center.
The Information Center provides information, brochures, calendars
of events and other campus information. But why isn’t the center
called the Information and IP Card Center anymore? Well, as student
worker, Nicole Watson, explains there are some changes.
“We’re (ID Center) moving starting this fall. The ID Center will move
over to the Enrollment Center,” Watson said.
The Enrollment Center is located on the firs t floor of the Rendleman
Building. Watson added the ID Center will also take on the
responsibilities of the universities’ meal plans. The Information Center
itself, will continue to work out of the University Center providing
information and service to students and faculty.
So If you’re lost and can’t find your way, remember in between the
two lounges (Opapi and Goshen) you will find another place to relax
your fears.

arbitrarily.

C oordinator S c o tt
G luntz defines th e term housing as
a goal to providing a loving learning
environment with a standard of
living conducive fo r stu d e n ts social
in te ra ctio n ,
p re tty
long and
technical definition, but what is it?
Housing is where you live, breathe
and eat. Housing is where you
spend your tim e outside of class.
Housing in a nutshell is where you
hang your hat. And a t SIUE you can
hang your h a t in the Residence Hall
or in Tower Lake Apartm ents.
There
are
some
d e fin ite
advantages to living on campus.
One advantage is it is close to all.
those wonderful classes th a t you
are taking. Another advantage is
the c o s t o f living, “ It is definitely
cheaper to live on campus than to
t r y to live in a house or apa rtm e nt
o ff campus, “ G luntz said, “ A lo t of
people use th e excuse t h a t it is
cheaper to live o ff campus, but they
are soon back in campus housing
with in a sem ester or two.”
The biggest advantage is th a t
living on campus gives students
access to com puters and th e
library a t hours when m ost people
will be heading fo r home.

Socially there are
advantages to living on campus as
well. “ it is much easier to get to
know people on campus if you see
them everyday coming and going
where you live. If it were not fo r me
living on campus, I would not have
picked the career I did and I would
not have m et my wife. “
G luntz also said t h a t th e
friends he made in college were
some of the closest friendships he
had ever encountered and these
friendships have influenced his life
the most.
With both form s of housing th e ir
are some d is tin c t perks fo r those
t h a t live there. In the Residence
Hall, stu d e n ts have th e unique
advantage o f living with all
freshmen which gives them the
opportunity to develop as a class,
G luntz said.
Also in the Residence Hall, there
are thre e meal plans t h a t
stu d e n ts may choose from fo r
th e ir meals. Meals are prepared fo r
the students in the Lower Level of
the UC.
S tude nts learn a little b it about
living on th e ir own and th e
responsibilities t h a t go along with
it while living in the Residence Hall,
however, Tower Lake takes th is
learning to another level.
A t Tower Lake students have a
freedom th a t can not be achieved
a t th e Residence Hall... th e
freedom to come and go as one
pleases. No one can possibly
m onitor your coming and going a t
Tower Lake and privacy is very well
guarded.
Also a t Tower Lake, students
have the opportunity to cook th e ir

own
meals, buy groceries,
take care of a whole apartm ent,
taking learning responsibility t o the
next step.
Housing has a lo t of advantages,

and
of
course
disadvantages. True, there is not
the complete freedom you would
have if you live o ff campus, but with
the c o s t of living, the ta s te of
responsibility and the closeness to
campus, the good outweighs the
bad.

Top Ten Things to do If you are under 21
10. Roam aimlessly around W al-Mart.
This is one o f my favorite p a s t times. I could do i t fo r
hours. You don’t have to buy anything, ju s t be there to
smell the W al-M art smells, to see th e women yelling a t
th e ir five children as they to o wander aimlessly
around, it is so American... and so-time consuming.

L iv e B ands
THIS FRIDAY & SATURDAY

9. Read a magazine. I am n o t talking about any rag mags like
Cosmo or Glamour. Read a real magazine, like Time or
NewsWeek. You can impress your friend la te r on by spouting
all the hot to p ics in th e News.
6>. Go see a movie. The Cottonwood has movies fo r all seats
$1.75 every day, you can’t beat t h a t price.
7. Go bowling, fowling can be a very entertaining pass tim e
if you make i t t h a t way. l3owl stupid, granny bowl backwards
or on your stomach. Half th e fun is watching other people
watch you bowl.

What t o take, w hat t o take, a
guide t o picking t h o s e c la s s e s
ByMelanie Adams
Editor in Chief
You’ve been accepted into SIUE and have picked where you are going to
live, the next step is to pick your classes, and fo r those of us undeclared
majors, the academic advisors in academic advisment will be glad to
a ssist you.
The fir s t step in picking your classes is knowing what it is you are
required to take fo r your general education and your designated or soon
to be designated major, Alison Barber, Academic Advisor said.
The next step is to pick o u t some courses th a t you think you may
enjoy taking and ask around about them. B u t be warned, ju s t because
someone else did not like the course doesn’t mean you won’t either.
“Everything is based on opinion, “ Barber said, “ If you have heard some
bad things about a class you can choose not to take it, but you amy
miss o u t on a good experience.”
If you pick a class th a t you don’t like, t h a t doesn’t mean you made a
bad choice, Barber said.
“There is no such thing as a bad choice, “ Barber continued, “ you’ve
learned something through the course and you’ve eliminated something
you don’t want to do. “
Barber also said t h a t the best tim e to decide to pick classes fo r the
next semester is by mid term s. “ The earlier the better. S tudents will
have be tte r choices fo r what is open if they choose th e ir classes early
on,” Barber said.
When it comes to declaring a major, when to declare depends on what
the requirements fo r the major are. “With some majors students can
declare right away because they do n o t have any requirements to fulfill
firs t,” Barber said.
In order to declare, if there are no requirements t h a t need to be
fulfilled, students need to be in good academic and financial

standing

Memorable

“In a conference you

1995-96 sports season
marked the firs t year
SIUE was apart of the
Great Lakes Valley
Conference and quickly
made their presence
known.
Along the way SIUE
teams found new rivalries
and now fans can actually
s ta rt to recognize
opponents since the
Cougars will have relatively
the same schedule each
year.
But the year was
topped off by several
events th a t need to be
mentioned again.

outstanding tennis play
throughout the year.

ished the year in post
season when they made it
to the GLVC tournament.

• Tennis head coach Bill
Logan received coach of
year in the GLVC for the
women’s season last fall.
• The softball team
finished 2nd in the
conference a fter a strong
season.

•
Men’s soccer played
their final games as a
Division I team and will join
the GLVC this season and
become a Division II team.
Last year had a lot of
moments to write about
and this upcoming GLVC
sports season should not
be any different. SIUE has
established themselves
and are ready to make a
run a t the championship.
“ In a conference you
establish rivalries and
th a t makes things exciting
especially for the fans,
Volleyball/softball head
coach Sandy Montgomery
said. “ It’s good to have
th a t and it is very
positive.”

• In their firs t season
the volleyball team
finished 11-12 in the
conference and made
post season tournament.
• The women’s soccer
team made it all the way
to semifinals of the GLVC
tournament.
• The baseball team

• The women’s tennis
team leads the list by
winning the GLVC last fall.
Their 11-0 record was
marked by good
performances from all the
players on the team.
• The year in women’s
basketball was highlighted
by Terri Evans breaking the
SIUE scoring record.

Todd Spann / Sports Editor

If there ever was an SIUE
team t h a t had an excuse fo r
having a poor year it would
of been the new founded
women’s volleyball team.
B ut instead of using
excuses the team stepped
up and had a remarkable
inaugural season going 15-15
and finishing 6 th in the
GiVC with a 10-12 mark, ju s t
good enough to make post
season play.
Of course everybody will
expect great things o u t of
the team th is year with six
returning players all of whom
received playing tim e la s t

Out of those six players is
sophomore Michele Gilman
who finished 12th in the
nation in blocks.
“ It’s quite an
accomplishment especially
fo r a freshman to come in
and do something like th a t,”
Head Coach Sandy
Montgomery said.
During the f ir s t season
Montgomery was very
pleased with the e ffo rt but
knew with more experience
the team could of won more
games.
“ I’m very happy with the

Men and women’s
program s see
rise in a th le te s

Things are starting to
f it into place with the
cross country/track
team. First, they have a
beautiful playing facility
and now the men have
tripled in number and the
women have doubled their
number.
Head Coach Darryl

Frerker made a few goals
when he took over the
program last year and one
of them is coming true.
“One of the goals was to
have a bigger team and
th a t has happened. The
next goal of ours is to get
better and then see if we
can make a run a t the

national tournament,”
Frerker said.
Frerker gave a lot of
the credit for the increase
in numbers to the track
and field stadium th a t
was built to house the
Summer Olympic Festival
in 1994.
