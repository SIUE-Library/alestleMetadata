Alcohol Awareness Program
and BACCHUS will be

By Ty Norris
News Reporter

O n T u esday, M arch 26, th e A m eric an D ia b e te s
A ssociation sponsored th eir annual A lert D ay to reach the
m ore th an eight m illion A m ericans living with undiagnosed
diabetes.
The org an ization has developed a hot-line to call to
receive a free risk test for anyone w anting to find out about
their p ersonal risk for diabetes.
“ O u r call to actio n is sim ple. C all th e A m eric an
D iab etes A ssociation at 1-800-342-2383, th a t’s 1-800-D-IA -B -E -T -E -S , and ask to receive a free risk te s t,” Jim
G ra n d o n e, spokesm an for the M adison C ounty C h ap ter of
the A m erican D iab etes A ssociation, said. “T he test allows
p eo p le to answ er seven sim ple q u estio n s ab o u t th eir

D iab etes, a disease th a t affects the b o d y ’s ability to

April has been designated as Alcohol Awareness M onth by
the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug D ependence,
Inc. (N C A A D ). During this m onth, the SIU E Alcohol and
Drug Awareness Prograim will be offering inform ation on
alcoholism and drug dependency.
Phil Parish, coordinator of the program at SIU E, said, “The
month of April is also National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness
Month. The program will prom ote awareness, safety and
responsibility of alcohol consumption.
“T here are negative high risks of alcohol use, such as low
academic perform ance and behavior,” Parish continued.
With that in mind, the SIU E Alcohol and Drug Awareness
Program , along with the new student group BACCH US
(B oosting A lcohol C onsciousness C oncerning H ealthy
U niversity S tudents), will be taking advantage of this
opportunity to enhance alcohol awareness among the college
campuses.
To encourage alcohol awareness, this year’s campaign will
be called “Draw the Line.”

Around the World
Slate and Local--------------------------------------School Board votes no tunnel
• School board members decided Monday night in a 3-3 vote to exclude a
pedestrian tunnel under Center Grove Road in construction plans for the new
Edwardsville High School. The $400,000 proposal had called for the underpass
to be 60 feet long, 12 feet wide and 8 feet high. It was one of about 100 cuts
made to the high school’s original construction plans to bring them within the
district’s $28 million budget. “It’s a safety issue, but on the other side of the
coin it’s an expensive issue,” School Board President James Speciale said.

Perot all but declares president candidacy
• Ross Perot portrayed the recent Republican primary campaigns as
“beyond sick”on Tuesday. But he bristled at suggestions from a student
audience at Texas A & M University that he had little to offer in the way of
new ideas. Perot has been appearing on broadcast programs to promote
himself and his new party. He is seeking to get the Reform Party on the ballot
in all 50 states. Although he insisted the efforts is “not about me,” he sounded
increasingly like a full-fledged candidate.

International-----------------------------------------Prime minister Major blames cow crisis on political opponents
• British farmers demanded Tuesday that the government begin killing
older cattle to calm public fears of the “mad cow” disease, but Prime Minister
John Major refused and blamed the entire crisis on his political opponents.
The National Farmers Union suggested frightened customers could be
reassured if Britain destroyed thousands of older cattle believed likely to have
contracted the fatal disease from eating sheep offal. If the government ordered
the cattle destroyed, it would be legally required to reimburse the farmers for
at least the herds' market value.

letter to th e e d ito r .

H o w c a n o n e c o n d e m n A b d u l-R a u f w h e n
o n e d o e s n o t k n o w w h a t h e stands fo r?
I am responding to all of the negative criticisms of
M ahmoud Abdul-Rauf. For the past two weeks I
have watched as individuals attem pt to derail and
discredit this man. Some critics suggest this is a racial
issue. O ther critics say that it is a m atter of money.
All of these reasons are false. The issue regarding
A bdul-R auf is a Muslim issue.
I will first address the statem ent that this is a
racial issue. On A m erican soil there have been a
great deal of atrocities that have happened in the
name of “justice for all.”
In the early 1930’s to the 1960’s p o o r and
uneducated men were used as test subjects by being
injected with Syphilis. This was called the Tuskegee
Experim ent. In the early 1960’s young children were
fed radiation to see how much a hum an could
w ithstand. This was called th e R adioisotop e
Experim ent. The Native A m ericans were driven off
their own land in the nam e of A m erican democracy.
Everyone in A m erica can find an oppressive
quality of A m erica to stand against. D ifferent people
take these stands in different ways. Some people
burn the U.S. flag, others defecate on it. A bdul-R auf
simply refused to stand for the national anthem . Why

don't you critics complain when som eone burns the
U.S. flag? Why d o n ’t you condem n a person when
they fly the C onfederate flag?
The second issue is the statem ent that AbdulR auf com prom ised his Islamic belief for the love of
money. A bdul-R auf was fined over $30,000 per
game. I do not consider that to be pocket change.
O ne critic said that no other Am erican citizen
would have given up all that money for their belief in
God. This too, was incorrect.
M uham m ad Ali gave up his heavyweight crown,
and was prepared to rot in jail to protest the
A m erican involvement in Vietnam. To m ake m atters
worse, the Suprem e C ourt agreed with him. The U.S.
Suprem e C ourt said that a man should not be
punished for his religious beliefs. By the NBA fining
A bdul-R auf they broke the U.S. Suprem e C ourt
ruling, thus giving m ore credence to the fact why
A bdul-R auf would not stand for the anthem.
The Holy Q u r’an teaches that if a believing
Muslim sees som ething wrong he should handle it in
one of three ways. H e should change it with his
hands, he should speak against it, or he should hate it
in his heart. A bdul-R auf did these things, and by

offering a prayer for all oppressed people while
everyone else stands for the anthem , exhibits his
hatred for these oppressive conditions that take
place on A m erican soil. H e did not com prom ise his
obligations or his Islamic beliefs, he fulfilled them.
For you critics to suggest otherwise, shows a lack
of knowledge for the real issue at hand. A bdul-R auf
said he does not condem n those who stand, so why
would you condem n him for choosing to sit?
The Q u r’an teaches Muslims not to prejudge
anyone because the knowledge of the intentions of a
hum an being is with G od alone. H ow can one
condem n A bdul-R auf when one does not know what
he stands for? Surely one cannot.
“O Ye who believe. Avoid suspicion as much as
possible: for suspicion in some cases is a sin and spy
not on each other: nor speak ill of each o th er behind
their backs.”
Q u r’an 49:12
Makin Hamzah

letter to the editor.

Comic writers seems to go unrewarded and unappreciated by campus
This letter is for Thom as Kwasa— A lestle Watcher.
First of all— I’m glad you like the A lestle—som e people work very hard on
this paper, and it’s about time they got som e credit for it.
I don’t, however, agree with your com m ent about the comics page. If you
would like to take time off from your school work to turn in 2 comics a week,
to not get paid for it— and to hear only about how much you suck—go for it! I
wish you luck!

It seems M elanie Adam s shares your opinion about the comics page—but I
happen to believe that there is a lot of talent on the page that goes unrew arded
and unappreciated!
Glad you’re happy with the rest of the paper, though.

Campus Comments
What is your favorite Alestle comic and why?

“Da Brainchild in
actuality is like everyday life
which in turn makes it all the
better.”

“Community Quest. I like
how it makes fun of the
unmentionable parts o f life.
It’s a period piece.”

Darren Jones
Sr., Pre-Med

Luso Mnthali
Jr., English

“I feel that all of the
comics are lacking that
special something. However,
“The Loose End” seems to
be the one that flirts the
most with something called
humor.”
Adam Preuter
Jr., Undecided

“Community Quest
because it talks about things
on campus and makes it out
to be a joke.”

“I like “The Loose End”

student was transported to Anderson Hospital by
Edwardsville Ambulance Service.
On Feb. 21, at 3:21 p.m. police and ambulance

Lee added that she was surprised to see that
with every task given to the group, there was a
student who stepped up to achieve it.
“From tiling to plumbing to teaching, our
group could do every task. It was amazing to
see how the students worked together and I
am very proud of the students and staff that
went on the trip. I am very proud of the skills
our SIU E student have, and everywhere we
go, these students use their skills,” Lee said.

them about their culture.
“I learned a lot about different cultures,”
Lee said. “Since I am an international student,
it was definitely a different culture for me. I
learned to be m ore sensitive to other cultures.”
Lee also said that the time the group spent
with the tribe is almost indescribable.
“ Seeing how hard they w ere trying to
preserve their culture so the next generation
has a continuance was inspiring,” Lee said.
“The whole trip was a good experience,”
Lee concluded.
SLDP is now looking ahead and planning

“Draw the line is a focus from the Illinois D epartm ent of Transportation,” Parish said. “It
discourages not just drinking and driving but underage drinking.”
“I believe that under 21 not drinking is not just a law, it’s a good idea. The percentage of
underage drinking are in the highest percent of drinking and driving accidents, dropouts,
violence and alcoholism.”
SIU E students Scott M ason and Shataka Tapes have strong feelings of alcohol awareness as
well.
“Education is the key,” M ason, a m em ber o f B A A C H U S said. “I think people need to know
what is going on and what can happen to them .”
Tapes, a junior m ajoring in sociology, said, “Alcohol awareness should be all year around
because if it is the num ber-one drug problem affecting today’s youth, it should not be limited to
one m onth.”
The SIU E Alcohol and Drug Awareness Program , along with B A A C H U S will “Draw the
Line” with prom otional activities ranging from a safe sum m er campaign to mock-tail bars.
Parish and M ason concurred, “M ock-tail bars are favorites because they offer great tasting
non-alcoholic beverages.”
During the m onth of April there will be inform ation regarding alcoholism as a drinking
problem and alcohol poisoning available.

LOS A N G ELES (AP>—A bout half of all California
State University first-time freshmen needed remedial
English and math in 1994, according to data released by
officials.
“It’s not a surprising set of numbers,” said Marsha
Hirano-Nakanishi, director of analytic studies for the
22-campus Cal State system.
“The data was from fall 1994 when we were just
beginning to discuss the issue. There wouldn’t have
been any time for change,” she said Monday.
The 1994 levels of unprepared students were the
highest since data was first tracked in 1989 with
numbers increasing annually every year since.
The results are based on aptitude tests given
annually to Cal State freshmen. Those found
unprepared are referred to remedial or high schoollevel classes. Cal State officials said the latest numbers
were based on the perform ance of about 22,000
freshmen in 1994.
The data found that 49 percent of all the state
university’s first-time freshm en needed remedial
English and 54 percent needed remedial math.
Eight of 10 freshmen at Cal State Los Angeles were
unprepared for college-level English courses, officials
reported Monday. Nearly 85 percent of all freshmen at

Cal State Dominguez Hills required remedial
instruction in mathematics that year, as did more than
70 percent of CSULA freshmen.
A t Cal State Northridge, almost 70 percent of
freshmen were unprepared in either English or math.
For five consecutive years, four Los Angeles area
campuses had dismal amounts of freshmen who were
unprepared to do college-level work in English and
math. Percentages of below-college ability level
students at the Los Angeles-area campuses were as high
as four times those recorded elsewhere.
“There’s probably no place in the world that’s got the
percentage of limited-English-proficient students that
are in the Los Angeles Basin,” said Hirano-Nakanishi,
citing one of the low-score factors.
Cal State officials also have cited other factors,
including more selective admission policies, varying
quality of students’ high school educations and possible
test biases.
Remedial education cost the 326,000-student Cal
State system costs about $10 million a year. When
freshman data was first released in January 1995,
proposals were made to abolish the remedial program.
But by the beginning of this year, after debate about

the factors behind the rising numbers, CSU trustees
adopted a new remedial policy that focuses on better
preparation of incoming students.
Under the new remedial policy, the university system
will try to reduce its share of freshmen in need of
remedial help to 10 percent by 2007. It plans to work
with elementary and high schools to better prepare
students.
But Cal State officials conceded it will be a long and
arduous task and that freshmen results are likely to
decline even further.
Freshmen from all minority groups in the study fared
worse than their white counterparts in both the English
and math results, with the lone exception of Asian
American freshmen, who did the best of all ethnic
groups in math. In 1994, 79.8 percent of all Cal State’s
black freshmen were unprepared to do college-level
math, as were 72.9 percent of Mexican Americans, 57.9
percent of American Indians, 44.6 percent of whites and
40.2 percent of Asian Americans.
Results of the 1994 English test were slightly better.
Just under 70 percent of black and Mexican American
freshmen were unprepared for college work, as were
68.3 percent of Asian Americans, 33.8 percent of
American Indians and 24.2 percent of whites.

Solo defines ‘New Classic Soul’ in debut CD
great beat, good lyrics, and to add to
the song further, the background
music contains the Dramatics “In
The Rain.” This particular song is the
best I’ve heard using the song since
Keith Sw eat’s rendition of “In The
Rain.”
The only concerns that I had
with the CD was that on several cuts,
Solo sounded like o th er current
R&B acts. Such is the case on “Keep
It Right Here,” the track sounds a lot
like U N V ’s “Something Going O n.”
A nother song which sounded alike
was “ H e ’s Not G ood E nough.”
However, with their unique singing
ability, I’m sure listeners w on’t mind.

Fashion: G enerally refers to what we wear.
Example: Shoes, hats, coats, pants, etc.
Fashionable: The prevailing style of the season.
Example. W earing bell-bottom s or straight legged pants.
Fashionably correct: In accordance with basic fashion
rules and guidelines regardless of what is fashionable.
Example: Not wearing white shoes after labor day or
before m em orial day.
Fashionist: O ne who is well-versed in fashion.
Example: M ost fashion designers.
Style: Refers to both the cut of the fabric and the design
of the garment.
Example: W hether a jacket is hip-length or waist-length
is style.
Styling: Designing what is fashionable.
Example: W hen color blocking was in style, shirts,

A day in the life of a "ticket matt"
“We do not make the rules. We
enforce them • 99—Tony Langendorf, SIUE ticket man
B y Cathryn Nicholson
For the Alestle

Each day starting at 8 a.m., seven vultures working for Parking Services get
into their cars to canvas campus and ticket innocent victims. According to
students, this is what the parking ticket guys do five days a week. Does this
really happen? I have read all the letters to the editor about the “ruthlessness”
of these guys and laughed at all the cartoons poking fun at their jobs. The
question is, “Do they deserve it?” I spent some time riding around with Tony
Langendorf, the supervisor of the Parking Services Department, to find out the
truth.
It is the ticket guys job to regulate parking. That involves making sure people
are parking in the appropriate lots, paying the meters, parking within the lines,
displaying the parking decal correctly and so on. The ticket men are also
responsible for keeping the Hairpin, Peck service road, and Tower Lake inner­
roadway clear in case of an emergency situation. If an emergency occurs, the
last thing emergency staff wants to deal with is an illegally parked car.
Students and faculty, lets be realistic. Who parked your car in the wrong lot?
Who did not refill the money in the meter? Who parked their car in the Hairpin
and left it there? In Tower Lake, who parked your car in the inner-roadway for
use as your personal parking space? If you want to blame someone for the
ticket, blame YOURSELF.
There are many excuses used by students for parking illegally. Many people
say they were just running in the building to drop something off. Here is an FYI
for you! There are parking meters around every major building on campus in
case you just have to run in. There are meters behind the Rendleman, on the
service road by the Peck, behind Building II and III, at the VC, at the Art and
Design Building and behind the Communications Building. If you are just going
to run in, you can drop a nickel in the meter or pay $15 dollars for a ticket.
Some people want to eliminate the whole Parking Services Department. For
those students who have been at SIUE long enough to remember the week
long grace period in August where tickets were not issued, it had to be reduced
to a day because people were abusing the grace period. Langendorf explained.
“We had everyone parking illegally. There were cars in the grass, cars in wrong
lots, and even on the sides of buildings.”
So without regulation out of control, parking would cause more problems.
Campus needs the ticket men to regulate parking. Imagine what campus would
look like if people could park wherever they wanted. CHAOS!
While we were in the Hairpin, a Bi-State bus tried to drive around the circle
but could not get all the way through because someone had parked his car and
left it. That is a small of what they deal with everyday. In addition, the Tower
Lake bus has problems dropping off and picking up students because of the
congestion in the Hairpin. Whenever there are problems like this, the ticket men
are called to come and ticket.
Many of the ticket men have encountered verbal and sometimes physical

sticker for parking in Lot E behind the communication building.

confrontation over a $15.00 parking ticket. A ticket man getting cursed out can
be a daily thing. Langendorf said, “Many of the confrontations happen when
you are in the middle of writing a tipket. They come out of the building
screaming ‘you S.O.B.’” The harassment at Tower Lake got so bad that an
additional ticket man was hired for safety purposes. People have threatened to
beat up or kill the ticket men. One time a ticket man had a chair thrown at him.
While I was riding around with the ticket guys, we went to the parking lot
behind Buildings II and III. We did not have to look hard for violations. In the first
row we went down, I spotted three cars parked in the wrong lot. As we drove
down by the meters, we noticed many that were expired. Next we drove over to
the Hairpin. There were three cars parked in the circle. One car was left there
by the owner, who received a ticket. The others were parked with the owners
standing right by them. The owners of those two cars were just hanging out,
playing their music. They were asked to leave three times and each time they
said, “we’re just leaving.” But they never did. We waited for fifteen minutes and
they never left. Finally, the ticket man told them they had to leave or they would
get a ticket. Why did the ticket man have to threaten the individuals before they
left? Langendorf explained that situations like this one frequently caused
confrontations. Why should that cause confrontation when the ticket guys are
just doing their job?
No matter how much students and faculty hate the ticketing department,
they are still doing their job. Langendorf said, “I guarantee you nobody out here
gets a thrill out of writing tickets.”
Students and faculty, the next time you illegally park and get a ticket,
remember that the ticket men are people too. The ticket “vultures" are guys who
are doing their jobs. Langendorf wants people to know “we do not make the
rules; we enforce them." Advice for people who love to curse out the ticket man:
next time try being nice and it will get you a lot further than being abusive. For
those of you who feel “victimized” by the ticket men, you can always file an
appeal with Vehicle Registration.

From its inception, the w om en’s studies program has been
interested in helping students and in bringing about forums for
discussion on a num ber of issues.
. In 1977, faculty m em bers of the program helped form the
student group, W omen for Women.
A lthough the w om en’s studies program had no funding at
that time, through the financial support of W omen for Women
and with departm ental assistance, the program was able to
bring in a num ber of speakers betw een 1979 and 1984. Topics
such as G ender Role Changes in Indigenous Mexico and The
Black Fem ale and the Black Com m unity were offered.
“We’ve had a lot of cooperation with W omen for Women,”
B arbara Schmidt, coordinator of the W om en’s studies program,
said. “It’s good when we can get together but the problem is
that the student leadership changes, so coordination hasn’t
always been consistent.”
Last year, the group and the geography departm ent co­
hosted a program on ecofeminism.
“The problem is also funding. We’ve had some years when
W omen for W omen had the m oney and we provided the
expertise,” Schmidt said.
Because people still tend to think of w om en’s studies as
nothing m ore than “flu ff’ courses, the program has sought to
bring atten tio n to cu rren t faculty and g rad u ate stu d en t
research.
To th at end, the Brown Bag Luncheon Forum was presented
in M ay 1984 w ith Sheila R u th as its first speaker. The
coordinator for the forum rotates; this year it’s M artha Bailey
of the political science departm ent.
In February, P rofessor Suzanne Jacobitti, a political
philosopher, presented “H annah A rendt and a New Political
Culture.” She is currently at work on a book of the same
subject. In April, associate professor Kris Kissman will present
“ In terv en tio n R esearch with A d o lescen t M others: From
Parental Skills to Father Involvem ent.” No date has been set.
“It isn’t always som eone in the program ,” Dr. Barbara
Schmidt, coordinator for the W om en’s Studies program , said.
“We’ve had poet Allison Funk read her work and a male
speaker recently read a paper he presented at a Popular
Culture Conference.”
In January 1994, (title) M argaret Simon of the philosophy
departm ent, helped to form a group that prom otes support and
recognition for wom en on campus.
Since 1992, the W om en’s Studies program has offered the
M artha Welch W om en’s Studies Student award. This award is
presented to a student who has taken w om en’s studies courses
and is active in the community. A letter of recom m endation is
needed from a faculty m em ber and the aw ard is presented on
H onors Day.
Traci Shobe received the first aw ard in 1993.

jackets and dresses were designed that way. (Yuk!)
Stylized: M aking changes in fashion.
Example: Placing the em phasis on the fat heel on women
shoes.
Stylish: A dding a special touch o r design,
Example: Em broidery or sequin.
I believe the root of the problem stems from the use of
verbs, adverbs and adjectives, which creates both the doublem eaning and confusion. Nonetheless, I hope this lesson helps
you in the future when reading fashion magazines and the
like.

Five Cougar basketball players selected
to All-Academic winter conference team
Illustrating excellence on the court and in the classroom, five Southern Illinois University at
Edwardsville student-athletes were selected to the 1996 W inter A cadem ic A ll-G reat Lakes
Valley C onference teams.
For SIU E, juniors Cristina Loomis and Amy Tuetken and freshm an Kim Lowe represented
the w om en’s basketball team and sophom ore N athan K reke and freshm an Tim Thorsen
com prised the male C ougar counterparts on the team.
H ead Coach Wendy H edberg said it is good to see the players effectively m anage academics
and athletics.
“Academics is of the utm ost im portance, and I’m pleased to see these players balance the
two,” H edberg said. “I’m glad to see these players do well considering our long schedule and the
conference trips.”
Loomis, one of the team captains, started 20 out of 26 games for the Cougars this past season.
The Troy native hit 35 of 82 shots from the field for an ^v erag e of 42.7 percent and m ade 15 of
18 shots from the foul line for 78.9 percent. She was second on the team in blocks with six and
tied for third on the squad in assists with 36.
With an average of 11.4 points a game, Tuetken was third on the team with 296 points. The
forward from Jerseyville was second on the team in assists with 52 and in three-point field goal
percentage with an average of 37 percent.
Starting four games in her freshm an campaign, Lowe was the fifth leading scorer for the
Cougars, averaging 7.2 points a contest. The H am ilton native connected on 74 of 157 shots for
47.1 percent from the field.
The C ougar wom en com pleted their first conference run with an overall m ark of 15-11 and
GLVC record of 10-10.
H ead coach Jack M argenthaler said it is good the players are recognized for their
accomplishments.
“It’s great honor for those guys because they have exhibited the skills in both areas,”
M argenthaler said. “It is good to see these players participate at this level and continue to
further their education to such a high degree.”
K reke rounded out the Cougars in double figures with 10.4 points a game, totaling 260 points
on the year. Starting 24 out of 25 games, the forw ard from Effingham was second on the team in
rebounding with 5.2 boards a game and third on the squad in field goal percentage, hitting 107
out of 187 shots for 57.2 percent.
Seeing action in 24 games, Schaum burg’s Thorsen shot 54 percent from the field, connecting
on 27 of 50 shots.
The C ougar m en finished their first year in the GLVC with an overall record of 10-15 and a
league m ark of 7-13.
The A cadem ic All-GLVC criteria includes a 3.0 overall grade point average (out of 4.0 scale)
or a 3.25 GPA in two consecutive sem esters for those student-athletes at an institution for over
a year. The requirem ents for freshm en consists of a 3.25 GPA.

playing strong,” Logan said.
B ut the m ost exciting m atch came at the
No. 2 position where G em inn won a three set
thriller against D arren Giuggio. The most
- impressive stat is that Giuggio has not been
beat at the No. 2 singles in three years.
“Jason played really strong,” Logan said.
“It was a slug fest out there. H e was very
impressive and this guy he beat was a good
player. Jason just all of a sudden dug in and
b ea t’em.”
Logan added, “Jason looked at me after
one of those hard points and said, ‘I’m glad
we are doing those sprints.’ So the hard
practice is paying o f t”
From that hard work Callen Hanks, R eede
and Licata came out with single victories and
the Cougars also sw ept all three double
matches.
T he C ougars m atch on Tuesday was
rescheduled for Wednesday, A pril 3 because

preparing for a m atch-up with Indianapolis

So far this season, the SIU E baseball
team ’s offensive output has been up and
dow n, but the pitching has rem ain ed
constant. This p a tte rn held tru e again
W ednesday as the Cougars tu rn ed two
impressive pitching perform ances into a
pair o f victories over conference rival
Quincy.
The Cougars, playing on their practice
field since Roy Lee Field is not yet in
playing condition, battled the cold w eather
to win by the scores of 2-1 and 11-1.
In the first game, pitcher Ryan Cox took
center stage and despite his team ’s troubles
at the plate, the freshm an was able to hold
the Hawks in check in going the distance
for his second victory of the season.
Cox credited his success to the play of
his team in the field. H e said that once the
team gets rolling defensively, they play very
well and his confidence level goes up.
H ead coach Gary Collins was im pressed
by Cox’s perform ance.
“Cox has great stuff ... he challenged
them and they w eren’t able to get their bats
out,” Collins said.
The Cougars took a 1-0 lead in the the
third inning when M ark Burris hit into a
fielder’s choice, scoring Shawn Schulze who
had doubled.
The Hawks were able to tie the game in
the to p of the sixth, b u t the C ougars
answered right back with a run of their own
in the bottom of the inning. Burris reached

on a dropped third strike and was sacrificed
to second before scoring the final run of the
game on a single by Marie Briggs.
In the nightcap, the Cougars once again
got a good pitching perform ance as junior
E ric M um m a threw eight im pressive
innings to move his record to 3-1. Jason
G uest took over in the ninth to finish the
game.
In this game, the Cougars offense woke
up and was able to produce a little more
run support for their pitcher.
The leader of the Cougars offensive
b arrag e was second basem an, B rian
Geluck, who came into the games with a
team leading .436 batting average. A fter
going 0-for-2 in the first game, the Swansea,
111., native was able to bounce back by
going 3-for-5 with two triples and a double
while driving in three runs.
“In betw een games I went and took
some swings in the cage,” Geluck said. “I
was seeing the ball well all day, but in the
first game I was being anxious.”
Collins is happy to see Geluck having
the success h e ’s had this season.
“H e’s been consistent. H e’s having a
great season so far,” Collins said.
The Cougars jum ped out in front once
again in this game with two runs j n the
second and from there they never looked
back as they continued to tack on runs
while facing four different Quincy pitchers.
The Cougars now take their 15-7 (4-4)
record on the road for the w eekend with
doub leh ead ers against St. Josep h ’s and
IU PU -Ft. Wayne.
