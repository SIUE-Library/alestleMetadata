Few turn out to meet the candidates
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
Voter apathy m ay have been
the reason for the low turn-out at
Tuesday n ight’s “ M eet the
C an didates”
in
the
M ass
Communications Theater.
Tom L au h er o f W R Y T radio
station was the m oderator for the
event. He told the candidates, “ I
don’t have m usic to drown out
speakers who speak too long like
they did at the Em m ys.”
Nine can didates gath ered to
introduce them selves and discuss
key issues in the upcom ing
election. S ev eral o f them have
been educated at S IU E , including
G lenn B radford (D ), Velda
A rm es (D ) and Joh n Shim kus
(R).
M ario G arcia (R ) was eager to

“ listen to the needs o f the
p eo p le .” A s a form er business
p ro fesso r at the U niversity of
Puerto Rico and a retired captain
in the U. S. Army, G arcia said he
feels like he understands the
com munity. He w ants to attract
more students to S IU E by voting
in favor o f expansion. In addition,
G arcia
supports
the
im provem ent o f transportation
system s like H ighway 159.
A s a fath er o f two children in
the Edw ardsville public schools,
G lenn B radford (D ) insists that
education is num ber one on his
list o f priorities. H e would like
to see area schools share
resou rces and participate in
cooperative programs in hopes of
strengthening the community.
B radford spoke strongly about
the relationship b etw een tax

dollars
and
private
institutions.“ We have to stop
taxp ayer m oney from going to
private institutions,” he said.
D avid
A h o la
(D )
said
mudslinging was not a part of his
campaign. B ut he then targeted
his opponent, Frank Watson (R )
with
accepting
financial
contributions from tobacco giant
Phillip M orris. A h ola wants to
outlaw the personal use of
campaign funds and put a ban on
campaign contributions.
S tate Sen ato r Frank W atson
(R ) did not retaliate. He directed
his focus on education, w elfare
reform , and creating new jobs.
Watson said that he was pro-job
and pro-business.

Academic policy forces
students to declare majors
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
A change in academ ic policy could be the impetus
som e students need to find direction in their lives.
Currently, there is no time limit when students need
to declare a major.
“Technically, they could be students fo rever,”
W illiam H endey, assistan t director o f academ ic
advising said.
T hat will change beginning w ith the 1997-98
academ ic year. T h at’s when students w ill need to
declare a major by the time they’ve earned 60 credit
hours — about junior status.
“ T h ere are really two issues involved h e re,”
H endey said. “ R etention and the time it takes to get
a d egree.”
H e said students take “ an unreasonably long time
to get a degree. The typical student takes about seven
years.”
To some extent, that much time is understandable
b ecau se m any students are going only part tim e,
while dividing the rest o f their tim e betw een work
and family.
“ T he idea isn ’t to force students into m aking a
decision. B ut we have a lot o f students who lack
directio n ,” H endey said. “T h ey have difficulty
m aking choices, so it’s really for these students that
we are implementing this new policy.”
H endey Said students often get discouraged
because they feel and are, in fact, spinning their
w heels. “ T here is a correlation betw een rem aining
in an undeclared status and poor class w ork. If
students don ’t have a focus, goals they can work
toward, they don’t do as well in classes. A s a result,
they may drop out, which contributes to the retention
question.”
A cadem ic advising directs new and undeclared
students to the career developm ent center for help.
If students still haven’t declared a m ajor after 60
hours, they are put in a hold status and are unable
to register until they have developed a plan o f action.
H en dey said the policy w as not m eant to be a
punitive one. “The hope is that any punitive aspect
o f it will get students m oving.”

L et’s combine our talents and technology to discuss issues
R ead in g the low er front

August 27,1996 edition o f the
A lestle that iterated the
apparent misinformation that
the O ffice o f Inform ation
Technology
has
been
operatin g for “ seven years
without a budget” reminds me
o f a statem en t that I was
trained to use in the Arm y;
“ Fire for E ffe c t” .
The intent o f initiating this
deadly statem ent was to inflict
maximum lethal dam age on a
target that was identified as an
enem y encampment.
1 realize that criticizing the
various
academ ic
and
adm inistrative support units
throughout the university
system is as each as easy, and
o ften as en jo yab le as an
arm chair
q u arterb ack
com m entating
a
Sunday
afternoon football game. But
after participating on the
playing field for a period of
time, one quickly realizes that
success
is
achieved
by
becom ing an active team
m em ber and focusing on the
same objectives.
I join ed the O ffice o f
Information Technology, OIT,
in August 1994.
Prior to
“ coming over” to O IT from
the academ ic side o f S IU E , I
also actively participated in
the “ Rush Lim baugh typ e”
nay-saying rituals against OIT.
I felt confident that I could
design and m anage the S IU E
campus network along with

the In tern et services and
m ake the com m unication
infrastructure a m odel that
other cam puses would envy.
I soon discovered after
arriving at O IT that I was
partly correct. I realized that I
would be an active participant
among many highly qualified
and com mitted m em bers of
O IT that operate under the
solid m anagem ent o f the
V C A ’s office.
Since my
migration to OIT, the “ lines in
the sand” between academ ic
support units and O IT have
all but disappeared and been
replaced by a new generation
of team oriented leaders and
very
en ergetic
cro ss­
functional team m em bers.
It took me several months
to com pletely understand all
the resp onsibilities o f the
O ffice
of
Inform ation
T e c h n o l o g y .
I even tu ally discovered
that som e o f O IT ’s direct
support
responsibilities
include running the databases
and creating the program s
that m ake sure every S IU E
em p loyee
receives
their
paycheck on time, every time;
students
receive
their
financial aid and are correctly
enrolled, telephones continue
to have a dial-tone and grades
arrive on time at the end of
the academ ic term and now,
the S IU E cam pus netw ork
can quickly em brace new
technologies such as desktopto- desktop interactive video

and voice conferencing.
Eventually I realized that
there are two experiences in
which humans can not relate;
infinity and zero. If the
paychecks always arrive, dial
tone persists day in and day
out, netw ork connectivity
withstands the endeavors of
any o f 2200+ netw orked
d evices com bined with the
potential 9000+ active users
who could potentially cripple
the infrastructure at any
minute of the day any day of
the w eek, and students receive
their grades at the proper
residence on time; the best
form of appreciation is often
s i l e n c e .
Now, two years later, I have
seen the cam pus netw ork
grow to over 2800 direct
connections which span the
Edw ardsville, E ast St. Louis
and A lton cam puses along
with every room o f the
R esid en ce
H all. Campus
network accounts now exceed
14,000 users with over 2000
new accounts requested and
disbursed during the first
w eek o f this sem ester. Any
user throughout the S IU E
cam pus can be contacted
electro n ically
by
sim ply
clicking their name from an
S IU E E m ail D irectory Web

letter to the editor

A1 Salvi’s opponent for senator should
have to reveal sources for PAC funds
U. S. Senatorial candidate
A1 Salvi’s opponent Richard
D. Durbin received $250,000 in
1995 from special interest
PACs.
One wonders why Durbin
accepts huge amounts o f PAC
m oney
w hen
retiring
Congressman A ndrew Jacobs
(D ) did not accept PAC
m
o
n
e
y
?
In the A m erican L egio n
magazine, August 1991, Jacobs
wrote, “ One can be sure a PAC
contribution
does
not
influence a legislator only if
the legislator does not accept
the PAC contribution!”
Rep. Jacobs concludes that,
“ Who pays the fiddler calls the
tune” and that, “ when PAC’s
finance the campaign fiddler
you can bet there are going to
be strings attached!”
Durbin should reveal A L L

the sources o f his PAC m oney
and the total collected in 1996.
Form er Illinois treasu rer
P at Q uinn (D ) criticized
D urbin
for
voting
for
governm ent subsidies for
w ealthy com panies that gave
thousands o f dollars to
D u rb in ’s cam paign. A s an
exam ple, the G allo W inery
reaped more that $100 million
in
tax
b reaks
and
S U R P R I S E ...S U R P R I S E ;
D u rbin ’s cam paign received
$21,250 from G allo!
Quinn also thought it was
im proper
for
D u rbin ’s
daughter to have received
financial
aid
from
a
scholarship fund established
by a lobbyist for Grumman
Corporation.
Not knowing Mr. D urbin’s
voting record on issues that
might benefit Grumman, it’s

difficult to know if Quinn was
com pletely accurate when he
described D urbin as the “cash
register D em ocrat who sells
out workers and taxpayers for
campaign contributions” .
It seem s to me that it would
have been more appropriate
for this scholarship to have
gone to a m ore deserving
student.
Instead, a family m em ber of
a millionaire career politician
with a fat taxpayer subsidized
pension received it!
If
D urbin
w ere
a
conservative the media would
be checking him out closer
than a proctologist but being a
liberal, Durbin needs only to
smile, point towards his halo,
and everything is alright!

Check Fee Increased
at
The Office Of The Bursar
Effective August 1, 1996, the Bank
Returned Check Fee (BRC) was
increased from $15 to $25 per BRC.
A BRC is defined as a check which has
been returned from a commercial lending
institution due to insufficient funds.
The revenue currently collected from the
BRC fee is not sufficient to cover all the
costs of collecting bad checks. This
increase will help shift the cost of BRCs
from all students back to those individu­
als who write bad checks.

Scooby --------------------------------from page 7

THE

and nail for that last Scooby snack. It was
disturbing.
For the life of me, I cannot figure out why
these kids didn’t realize what they had in their
possession. They owned a talking dog! D idn’t
they know how much m oney he could be
worth? They could have sold him to the circus
or at least gotten endorsem ent deals. Sure,
Scooby didn’t have perfect diction, but he was
only a G reat D ane, after all. Instead, they rode
from town to town solving dilem mas in the
M ystery Machine.
What was the deal with the van? There was
only a front seat for Fred and the ladies, and
Shag and Scooby w ere always bouncing off the
walls in the back. The sm ell in there had to be
stom ach-churning, stale dog fur and bong
resin. Yummy. It did have a groovy detail job,
though.
Now, after the fifth or sixth town with a fake
ghost or a spirit or a monster, wouldn’t anyone
be a little less leery o f being scared by the next
o n e? Why didn’t they ju st stak e out the
jan itor’s (who was going to be fired from the
fun house) shanty for a few days? Wait for him
to put on the w erew olf costume, and then nab
him.
Instead, they would look for endless clues in
order to get the sam e result. I think it was just
an excuse for Fred to use the words, “ L e t’s split
up” . That hormone-crazy teen, with his scarf
hanging on the side, just wanted an excuse to

P oe t’s Corner

send Shaggy and Scooby on a wild goose chase
while he got lucky with Daphne and Velma.
Som etim es, Fred would hide Velm a’s glasses,
just so he could have Daphne to himself.
Scooby and Shaggy were always the ones who
came across those fearsom e creatures. How
real could these m onsters look with a little old
man tucked inside? I guess Shag and Scoob
w ere so hopped up on goof balls, they always
thought something was trying to steal their
souls. The best they could do was put on some
weird Vaudeville show to fool the monster.
Pretty scary.
|
Som ew h ere along the line, they started
running across celebrities with ghost problems.
Who would have thought that Don Knotts,
Sandy Duncan, Mama Kass, and the Harlem
G lo b etro tter w ere crim e so lvers to o?! A
particular favorite was an anim ated, bickering
Sonny and Cher. The least these rich and
famous people could have done was to offer
these kids a meal or a change of clothes. They
must have had a pungent odor.
A fter fading in and out of consciousness
during the Scooby fest, I decided I should turn
o ff the television and get some real sleep.
U nfortunately, I couldn’t get the brain-melting
sound o f C asey K asem as Shaggy saying,
“ Garsh, Scoob” and the big, brown pooch
returning with “ Rho-kay Raggy.”
I think the next time I’m sick, I ’ll stick to
watching reruns o f “The Facts o f L ife.”

Ten years at the helm for soccer coach Huneke
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
Seein g his p layers succeed is what
gives S IU E m en’s soccer head coach E d
H un eke satisfaction. The relationship
that he has with past and current players
m ake it all worth while for him.
G row ing up as a typical C atholic
youngster in St.Louis, H uneke played
soccer in the winter and baseball in the
summer. H e played on the soccer team at
R osary High School before coming to
S IU E to study m arketing. H e played all
four years on the S IU E soccer team and
characterized him self as an average stu­
dent.
“The interesting thing about my edu ­
cation side o f attending S IU E was that I
went through in four years,” said Huneke.
“ B ack then we had to either keep a full
load o f classes or go to V ietnam .”

H e w ent to work at B row n Sh oe
Com pany for two years. A t the shoe com ­
pany,
H uneke
atten ded
St.L o u is
U niversity to receive his M asters. While
there, he ran into a fellow student who
asked him to teach part-tim e at Louis and
Clark Community College. H e decided
he needed to experim ent with a different
job and took the offer. This position led
to a full-time spot on the teaching staff as
a m arketing teacher.
“ When I becam e full-time, they asked
me if I wanted to start up a soccer pro­
gram since I had an extensive b ack­
ground in soccer,” said H uneke. “ I wasn’t
interested, but wanted the teaching job,
so I said yes.”
-A year later he hesitantly started the
team . To his surprise, he enjoyed the
experience and had a great deal o f suc­
cess.
“ It was a very enjoyable but busy time

for 12 years at Lew is and Clark. I spent
the m ajority o f my time either teaching or
coaching in that part o f my life.”
In February of 1986, S IU E coach B ob
G uelker died leaving the head coach
position open. Fortunately, H uneke
received the job to which he had aspired.
H uneke has been at the helm o f the
m en’s soccer team for 10 years.
“ We’ve had some good seasons and
som e disappointing seasons, but I’ve
enjoyed w orking with the peop le
involved in the program.”
H uneke still stays in contact with
many of his form er players.
“ They’ll call me up to talk or just to
ask for guidance or advice about their
careers. I like the fact that I’ve had a lot
o f positive influence on them. It’s an
enjoyable part of this job to touch play­
ers’ lives.

By Todd Spann
Sports Editor

From SIUE Sports Information
Coming o ff a successful w eekend at the
W estern Illinois Invitational, the S IU E
m en’s and wom en’s cross country team s
will look to extend their accomplishments
as they com pete in the Cougar Twilight,
Saturday.
H ead Coach D arryl Frerker looks for
the team s to shine this weekend.
“ I anticipate both team s running very
strong this w eekend. I would be surprised
if both team s did not finish on top,”
Frerker said.
The team s participating in the m eet
include M cK endree College, Lindenwood
College, Vincennes U niversity and Quincy
University. The W omen’s 4,000 m eter run
is slated for 6 p.m. followed by the m en’ s
6,000 m eter run at 6:30 p.m. The cross
country course is located behind the S IU E
residence hall, which is on the southeast
section o f the main campus.
Those individuals that would be inter­
ested in running as an independent may
call coach F rerker to sign-up at (618) 6922871. A $5 registration fee will be applied
to each independent runner.
