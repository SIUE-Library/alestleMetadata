A new virus known as
W32/MyDoom-BC was sent to
SIUE student e-mail accounts as
an attachment at about noon
Sunday.
“Hopefully nobody opened it
and was infected by it,” Office of
I n f o r m a t io n
T e c h n o lo g y
technician Dave M ueller said.
“We havea’t received any calls

about it yet.”
By 3:30 p.m., the infected
attachment in the letters was
being cleaned at the OIT antivirus/anti-spam server, according
to an e-mail sent by OIT. The
source of the virus has not been
determined.
OIT suggests all students

unexpected or unknown sender
never open
any
enclosed
attachments.

Help raise money for the Red Cross’ SIUE graduate is suing
tsunami relief effort at a Walk-a-thon producers of “The Apprentice”

Join
the
M asters
of
Marketing Research Student
Association and the American
Marketing Association in a walka-thon to raise money for the
tsunami relief.
The walk-a-thon will be from
2 to 5 pjn. Sunday at Korte Stadium.
MMRSA Vice President
Heather Schulte said this is a
chance
for
everyone
to
participate and help a good
cause.
“It is every student’s, faculty
m em ber’s, etc. chance
to
participate in (or donate to) an
event that can help provide relief
to those suddenly struck by
disaster,” Schulte said.
Schulte said those not in the
AMA or MMRSA can obtain a
pledge sheet from her or from the

Management and Marketing
Department. She said the
department is asking each
individual to collect as many
donations as possible.
“Pledges can be based on the
miles walked or an upfront
donation,” Schulte said.
Anyone who does not want
to walk may still donate money to
any member of AMA or MMRSA
who is participating in the event.
Schulte said a list of those names
can be provided if necessary.
Schulte said the idea was
thought of as an individual event,
but people can also choose to
walk in teams.
“We never discussed the idea
of having teams. However, it is
perfectly
fine
for
those
individuals who desire to walk
with friends, co-workers, etc.,”
Schulte said.
The money collected will be

credited to an SIUE account, and
then, it will be donated to the Red
Cross for the tsunami relief.
Schulte said if inclement
weather occurs, the walk-a-thon
will be moved to the Student
Fitness
C enter’s
Indoor
Track.
Schulte said no donation is
too little and wanted everyone to
put him self or herself in the
situation the tsunami victims are
facing.
“I think that we need to
remember how fortunate we all
are that we are not in such a
disastrous situation and, for a
minute, contemplate the fact that
if we were, we would pray that
others all over the world would
be willing to help in any way
possible,” Schulte said.

A paraplegic filed suit
against
“The
A pprentice”
producers
for
allegedly
discriminating against disabled
people.
James Schottel, a St. Louis
lawyer and a 1996 SIUE
graduate, filed suit against
producers o f Donald Trum p’s
NBC show, “The Apprentice,”
Feb. 4. Schottel claims the
producers are discrim inating
against would-be contestants like
him self and violating
the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
Schottel is paralyzed from the
waist down by a spinal cord injury.
“People say it’s just a TV
show, but the producers say it’s a
15-week interview, it is what it
is,” Schottel said. “If you can’t

walk, that tends to exclude a lot
of other people who are restricted
as I am.”
The suit says the Americans
with Disabilities Act covers
potential candidates for the show
because the program is billed as a
“ 15-week
job
interview,”
according to a Reuters article.
The show depicts players
competing for a high-paying
executive position in Trum p’s
business empire by completing
tasks given to them by Trump.
Trump eliminates a player at the
end o f each episode with his
signature phrase, “You’re fired.”
A requirement for the show
is that the contestants must be in
“excellent physical ... health.”
Schottel said he could participate
in the show’s activities, in one
way or another, despite being

Bowling just got better now
that students
and
student
organizations can bowl for a
good cause in the Big Brothers
Big Sisters Bowl for K ids’
Sake. The event will take place
at Cougar Lanes
in the
basement
of
the
Morris
University Center.
The organization is looking
forward to having as many
student
organizations
and
individual students participate as
possible.
BBBS Director o f Special
Events Deanna Christie said
people should participate in this
event if they want to help a
positive cause.
“Any
organizations
or
students that want to make a
difference in the life of a child are
encouraged
to
participate,”
Christie said.
Christie said there are 32
spaces open for teams or 160
bowlers. She hopes to have
enough students participate that
there is a need for a second day.
Christie
added
that
participants do not have to be a

member of an organization to
participate.
“Any student, staff or
employee
can
participate.
Anyone can grab four friends (to
make a team o f five) take a
sponsor sheet, sign up pledges
and bowl,” Christie said.
If a group has more than one
team, BBBS can schedule the
two teams in lanes next to one
another.
All money raised from the
event will support the BBBS and
will help match youth in local
communities with a positive role
model.
Christie said this event is
very important to the BBBS
because it is the most important
fundraiser the organization has.
“Bowl For K ids’ Sake is not
about bowling, it’s about doing
something fun that benefits kids,”
Christie said.
Christie added there are
prizes available for winners in the
event. For every $100 raised,
each bowler receives a Bowl For
Kids’ Sake T-shirt.
For $150 raised, bowlers
will receive a $10 AT &T phone
card and a T-shirt. For $250
raised, each bowler will receive a

$10 Schnucks gift card in
addition to the phone card and the
T-shirt.
For every $50 in pledges, the
bowler is entitled to one entry
into a raffle for prizes from area
businesses such as Kerasotes
Theatres, Starbucks, Sundazzlers,
various hair salons and gift
certificates to local restaurants.
Bowl For K ids’ Sake will
take place at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. on
Thursday, March 31, at Cougar
Lanes. Participants can sign up
for either time.

Why wouldn’t a person be
offended when being compared
to a group of militant dictators?
Apparently, Christopher Holmes
cannot deduce where the offense
to Liberals would be in that. This
whole argument of conservative
versus liberal is pointless. All it
does is anger one group, forcing
them to retaliate and anger the
other. We’re going in circles,
people.
I ’m a liberal and I enjoy the

idea of family - heaven forbid it
be a diverse family with possibly
(gasp) a same-sex couple. And
make sure that family loves Jesus
because if not, that entire family
is going to hell.
Also, the fam ily can’t
support any socialist ideas like
universal health care or governmentsponsored education because
those might raise taxes for the top
one percent of society, and we
can ’t go around making Bill

Gates mad. Note: sarcasm intended.
I also like the idea of life.
Now that also means I ’m
concerned about a person’s
quality of life. Say someone is
bom to a poverty-stricken family,
has to join the armed forces to
provide an opportunity to better
his or her life, is shipped halfway
around the world and then is
killed in a war with no clear-cut
meaning. That’s not really a life
filled
with
sunshine
and

lollipops, huh?
And why not let people have
freedom of speech; after all, it’s a
basic right to express ideas and
opinions. But why does Holmes
use that gift to hurt and bash
people? The freedom of speech
argument is just a cheap and easy
way of not having to back up
your opinion with facts.
I could say, “You’re a jerk.”
And, when asked why I said that,
see MENTALITY, page 5

Student says political parties should work together
This letter is in regards to
Nate Jones’ article about the flier
made by the C onservative
Students Organization.
This letter is also a response
to Chris Holmes take on Jones
article. It seems to me that
Holmes didn’t bother to respond
to the main point of Jones’ article,
the flier. Instead o f giving the
CSO ’s reasoning for using such a
powerful and out-of-context
image on the flier, he attacks
Jones instead. It is very apparent
that Jones is not attacking the

ideas of family values or freedom
of religion.
As a matter of fact, I have a
good friend, who has a family of
his own and was also offended by
the flier. Is this family man also
going against fam ily values
because he doesn’t agree with the
CSO’s poor and ill-informed use
of such a powerful image?
Also, I am offended by the
material and I have friends of all
different ethnicities, religions,
and opinions. The simple fact is,
you don’t have to be a

hardheaded zealot to be offended
by this material.
Oh, this reminds me of
another rather odd thing about
Holmes’ response.
In his letter, Holmes states
that Jones is “ ...unable to respect
others for their viewpoints.” So
the CSO flier that advocates
standing up to liberalism, thus
implying this is a conflict and
only one side can be right, is
being completely open-minded
of others’ opinions?
Oh please. W hen are we

going to get over this ridiculous
“us or them” mentality? I am
guilty of this as well but every
time I forget about it, one side or
another decides it’s time to start
another fight, as it seems in this
case it is the Conservatives
starting up with the Liberals.
I seem to rem em ber the
Bush administration expressing
that after the election, no
matter who won, it would be
a tim e
for everyone
to
come together and heal.

am sure it is the absolutely right

I could say, “I can say whatever I
want because I have freedom to
do so.”
That’s not a very appealing
situation, and it doesn’t resolve
anything. The only time I have
heard an extreme Conservative
shout free speech was when it
was for something he or she
believed in. If someone would
want to promote a viewpoint the
Conservative disagrees with, then
that person needs to be shut up.
If I read Nate Jone’s article
in the Feb. 15 issue of the Alestle
correctly, he isn’t classifying all
conservatives in this wide,
hatem ongering
net
that
whomever put up that flier falls
into. There are moderate and
extremists in every group. That’s
society for you. W hat Jones
wanted to present was the

question I’d like to ask again.
Why do we have to have this “us
versus them” viewpoint? Groups
like the Conservative Student
Organization and the SIUE
Democrats help further this issue
by demonizing each other.
Hate breeds more hate, folks.
In closing, I believe mostly
any media can be skewed to
support one side or the other, just
look at Fox News and Bill
O ’Reilly. You can preach fair and
balanced reporting all you want
and not practice it. However, if
the Alestle was so against
Conservatives, does Holmes
think it would have really printed
his letter?

Apparently, as evidenced by the
CSO ’s flier, that was a bunch of
bull. “Will you Stand Up to
Liberalism ?” doesn’t exactly
seem like a statement made to
unify people.
Holmes insists that he is
offended by Jones’ editorial and I
insist that Holmes hardly read the
article seeing as how he didn’t
even touch on the real subject of
said article. As far as freedom of
speech goes, the CSO got it.
I guess that freedom of
speech also means people can’t
respond to you though. So,
Holmes, is it only freedom of

have a dissenting voice?

and by the time the ad is ready for
models, actors and directors to
shoot it, it has passed through
several layers of executives who
have looked at the idea and
agreed it is a good one. Not just
one person, but many are
involved in this process. And they
all thought an ad debasing and
degrading women was a good
idea.
Don’t get on the men about
this. Many women are involved
in this decision-making process,
too. And I also understand that
sex sells; I am not against this,
but it can be done tastefully and
in a way that doesn’t present
women as sluts.
So, if it were up to me, I
think I would not take a BandAid approach like ripping down

pulling off its leaves - you pull it
out by the roots. I think I would
try to educate students and try to
understand, maybe even research,
the social issues underlying this
tendency to disrespect women in
our society. This is what I would
expect from tenured professors at
a university, not gang-mentality
and m utilation of the First
Amendment.
But as I said, what do I
know? I am just a working stiff. I
am sure the rights of the students
will be fully protected under the
watchful eye of Tallant and her

anger them.

Time to file for financial aid
As the financial aid deadline draws near, the advising staff is preparing for a flood of applications.
File your FAFSA early and consult with an adviser to get your financial aid for the coming year.
T hom as

C. P h i l l i p s II I

The FAFSA

L if e s t y l e s S t r in g e r

Sophomore Patricia Hearns is filing
for financial aid for the first time, and is
already a year behind, at least, according
to the SIUE Financial Aid web site, at
http://www.finaid .siue .edu.
Hearns is behind because the
information on the web site was
last updated on Nov. 22, 2004.
This is frustrating to students like Hearns
who are in search o f answers in order to
fill out the Free Application for
Federal Student A id by the preferred
deadline of March 1, 2005.
“It’s so difficult to fill out this
stuff and find information on how to
do it correctly, especially if it’s
not even updated,” said Hearns. “I don’t
know if it’s even worth it to go through all
of it.”
It is the tim e of year again
where financial aid becom es a top
priority for returning and incoming
students thinking ahead to the fall
semester.
Financial aid applications can
be a huge stumbling block for students,
and can result in a number of mishaps
if done incorrectly, from receiving little
to no aid to being scammed out of
money by fake counselors or advisors
promising larger am ounts o f financial
aid in exchange for a monetary “service”
fee.
Fortunately, advisors in the Office of
Financial Aid at SIU E are preparing
students - and themselves - for the next
few
months
when
financial
aid
applications begin pouring in.
SIUE financial aid advisor Linda
Hahn stressed the im portance of the
preferred deadline for applicants.
“The deadline for applications as a
whole is not March 1st, but it does help
students who get their applications in
during
that
tim e,“
said
Hahn.
“We really want students to get as much
funding as possible.”
Although there is no official number
of applications filed for this year available
at press time, Hahn said that the number of
applicants should not deter students from
applying.
“All are encouraged to apply for aid,”
said Hahn. “There are all kinds of funds
available to students, no m atter the
situation. Only in rare instances do
students not receive any financial
assistance.”
To encourage students to get
their forms in early, the office is
taking steps such as mailing postcard
rem inders to those who filed their
forms late or not at all last year,
and encouraging students to file the

All SIUE students are required to
fill out the FAFSA in order to receive
any type of financial aid. The financial
aid office uses FAFSA
results to
determine eligibility for need-based
federal and SIUE programs, as well as
the M onetary Award Program for
Illinois residents.
Completing the FAFSA is the first
step in the financial aid process. Once it
is submitted, the office will process the
information. An electronic copy of
information is made available to the
schools listed on the application. The
Student Aid Report, or SAR, is sent to
the student. It is important to review
the SAR to make sure all of your
information is correct and to provide
any necessary corrections or additional
information.
Information is then entered into a
formula from the Higher Education Act
of 1965, as amended, and the result is
the Expected Family Contribution, or
EFC. The EFC measures the student’s
family's financial strength, and is used
to determine eligibility for federal
student aid. If the information is
com plete, the stu d en t’s SAR will
contain the EFC.

FAFSA online, using the quicker
electronic method over the traditional
postal route.
However, those who think that
counselors will fill out the form
for students are misled, according to
Hahn.
“We do not fill out the FAFSA for
students,” said Hahn. “That’s one of the
biggest misconceptions people have about
financial aid advisers. We will offer
advice, but that’s about it.”
Hahn said that the office is open on
weekdays to help students by answering
any financial aid related questions that
they may have.
“W e’re
also
happy
to
offer

our services as counselors and advisors for
those who need help filling out the forms,”
said Hahn. “Students who are interested
should make an appointment with our
advisors. We’re available Monday through
Friday during business hours.”
After hearing about the services
offered by Financial Aid, Hearns is
“slightly relieved” by the news.
“At least it won’t be so bad now that I
can get some advice on what to do and
what not to do,” Hearns said. “It’s a nice
way to learn without having to miss out on
the money.”
For more information on financial
aid, or to make an appointm ent, call
650-3880.

The schools listed on the student’s
application may request EFC along
with the rest o f the student’s
information. Schools use the EFC to
prepare a financial aid package that
meets
students’ financial
need.
Financial need is the difference between
your EFC and the school's cost of
attendance (which can include living
expenses), as determined by the school.
Special circum stances that may be
taken into account are unusual medical
or dental expenses or a significant
change in income from one year to the
next. Contact the financial aid
administrator at the schools to discuss
special circumstances.
Any financial aid a student is
eligible to receive will be paid to the
student through the school. Typically, a
school will first use the aid to pay
tuition, fees, and room and board (if
provided by the school). Any remaining
need is paid to the student for other
expenses.

~ Health Wise
Pregnancy season is blooming on campus;
get the resources needed to stay healthy.
S ara W est
L ifestyles R eporter

After being cuddled up all winter
due to the cold weather, signs of spring
are beginning to arrive.
These signs, however, are not
necessarily sunshine, warmer weather
and blooming trees. The signs of
spring showing up in many women
on campus are mood swings, extreme
fatigue, nausea and vomiting, frequent
urination and food cravings.
It is pregnancy time. And, along
with the stresses of being students,
women who are part of the campus
community and find themselves
pregnant need to evaluate physical and
emotional health.
M. Kelly Shanahan, a physician
who writes and reviews for Yahoo!
Health, said that women also need to
realize the signs and symptoms
predicting pregnancy may be varied
among women. She added that a
missed period is not always the first
indicator of pregnancy.
“If you’re pregnant, it’s also
possible fa- you to think you’ve had
your period when you didn’t,”
Shanahan said. “When a newly
fertilizedegg attaches to the wall of the
uterus, sometimes it prompts a little
bleeding.
“In other cases, wildly
fluctuating hormone levels in the first
week or two after conception may
prompt some bleeding... you might
assume that this bleeding is your
period,” Shanahan added.
Further, Shanahan said a home
pregnancy test may be the easiest
indicator for a pregnancy.
Once a test has indicated
pregnancy, a woman must get proper
nutrients that are crucial to fetal
development.
The
National
Institute
of Diabetes
and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases recommended
that pregnant women eat foods rich in
iron, calcium, folate, fiber and protein.
The institute also said pregnant

women need to avoid taw fish, fish
high in mercury such as tuna and
swadfish, soft cheeses and anything
that is not food.
The National Women, Infants
and Children program reported
pregnant women tend to crave
nonfood items such as ice, chalk and
clay, and these items may be harmlul
to the developing fetus.
W1C also said that there are
counselors and nurses available to
further assist pregnant women with
low incomes in order for them to
receive proper nutrients and emotional
well-being during pregnancy.
As a pregnant college student, a
woman may be more at risk for a
challenging pregnancy due to the
added stresses of schoolwork and
possible financial strain.
The American Pregnancy
Association and the Web site at
www.pregnancyjorg have provided a
plethora of information regarding all
aspects of pregnancy across all
different types of women. Not only
has the site offered solid prenatal
advice, but the site provided
anonymous submissions from other
college students who have become
pregnant while still completing
ooursework.
One student wrote, “I was a
normal everyday teen going to college
and trying to weak a full-time job.
Suddenly I was told that I was going to
be a parent, too.
‘1 am writing this stay for (other
pregnant college students) that can’t
talk to their parents ... a baby doesn’t
make you want to give up, it only
makes you stronger,” she added.
The APA also indicated that
pregnant women must get regular
prenatal visits with a family physician
or obstetrician as well as take prenatal
vitamins.
The association said the
physician will be able to monitor and
evaluate the pregnancy to make sure
both the mother and the fetus are
healthy; the physician will also

The 18-piece SIUE Jazz
Band is geared up to perform
its
fourth
annual
concert
at Sheldon Concert Hall in St.
Louis.
The concert will feature 10
pieces of music arranged by
director Brett Stamps, an SIUE
music professor, at 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday. The band consists of five
saxophones, five trumpets, four
trombones and a percussion
section.
“It is similar to a recital for
my music, with the students
performing the music along with
some faculty members who will
sit in and perform with the band,”

Stamps said.
The concert is part of the
“Notes from Home” series that
makes Sheldon Concert Hall
available to local performers for
concerts on Tuesday evenings.
“It will be an evening of big
band jazz where we will perform
half
originals
and
half
arrangements,” Stamps said. “It
will have a contemporary spin,
with
influence
by
other
jazz faculty, and the audience can
enjoy some unique twists on some
very famous songs.
“For example, we are playing
a rendition of Jerome Kerns’
‘Yesterdays’ and inserting part of
the ballad ‘Yesterday’ by the
Beatles,” he added.
Tickets will be $5 at the door

provide the pregnant woman with
important information regarding fetal
development during each of the three
trimesters of pregnancy.
The Web site incorporated
a list of items a pregnant woman
should not do, and these include
avoiding drugs, alcohol and smoke,
not taking prescription or over-thecounter medicine without physician
approval, avoiding hot dogs, caffeine,
x-rays, uncooked meat, water beds
and electric blankets and trying not to
expose oneself to reptiles, cat litter, tick
bites and pesticides.
The Arms of Love Pregnancy
Resource Center in Godfrey, 01. said
its doois are open for SIUE students
who are pregnant. The center reported
that it offers positive counseling in
order to keep stress levels at a
minimum. And, the center offers

deal for St. Louis performers in

up-and-coming
comedian Retta, on Tuesday in
the University Restaurant at 5:30
p.m.
Bom and raised in Newark,
N.J., and a graduate of Duke
University, Retta gave up a career
in pharmaceutical research for
stand-up comedy.
Retta, who has been in the
business for five years, has been
featured on shows ranging from
V H l’s “The List” to Comedy
Central’s “Premium Blend” and
her own half-hour special.
Although her comedy style
revolves around sharing personal
stories about family, friends and
everyday life, Retta enjoys a
good joke herself every now and
then when she’s not telling them.
“My new favorite is one by
Jeffrey Ross,” stated Retta in the
Ojai Valley News. “He told this at
Hugh Hefner’s Friar’s Club roast
on Comedy Central. He said
Hugh had introduced him to an
adult film actress, a nice and very
attractive girl. So, he said, he
asked her out. The actress said
she was working Tuesday and

Thursday?’ His response was,

that doesn’t happen anymore. I’m
pretty used to the nerves these

Cougars sweep
weekend series

Seniors pick up pace in final home games to
beat Kentucky Wesleyan and Bellarmine
Z ach G

roves

S p o r t s E d it o r

It was “senior weekend” at
the Vadalabene Center for the
SIUE men’s basketball team, and
the seniors responded with two
Great Lakes Valley Conference
wins.
The Cougars buried the
Bellarmine Knights Saturday 8353, but not before they picked up
their 20th win o f the season
against the Kentucky Wesleyan
College Panthers 68-56 in the last
home games of the 2004-05
season.
While the game appeared to
be in Bellarmine’s hands early
leading 11-4, SIUE persevered
and took a 21-20 lead on senior
forward Joel Jay e’s 3-pointer
with 9 minutes, 43 seconds to go
in the first half, a significant part

o f his team-leading 17 points.
That shot proved to be the
launch pad for the C ougars’
explosive drive. After a 22-8 run
to close out the period, there was
nowhere to look but up for the
rest of the game.
“Ii was senior day and there
was quite a bit of emotion,” head
coach Marty Simmons said. “We
seemed to get out pretty slow, but
I give our guys credit. They made
the adjustments and picked up the
intensity.”
The Cougars also held the
Knights to a stingy 30 percent
from the field, which Simmons
believed was the key to their
drive.
“I think once we started
getting some stops on defense,
we were able to get some
transition baskets and just got
into the flow as the game went

on,” Simmons said.
Seniors center Kris Crosby
put up a career-high 15 points to
complement Jaye, and forward
Tim Bauersachs scored 14 points
to go with his career-high six
assists. Senior center Dan
Heimos also took part in the
Cougars 58.3 percent shooting
effort with 12 points.
“Kris gave us a huge lift off
the bench,” Simmons said. “(He)
came in there, got a couple dunks
and really guided us, giving us
that shot in the arm that we
needed.”
Thursday looked to be the
warm-up the Cougars needed for
Saturday, downing the Panthers
after a double-double effort from
Bauersachs and a major 27-5 run
to stay ahead.
Bauersachs notched 16

s t r in g e r

Just when the SIUE women’s
basketball team looked to finish
strong at the end of the home
stretch, Bellarmine U niversity
and Kentucky Wesleyan College
slowed it down over the
weekend.
Despite a valiant effort by
freshman guard Whitney Sykes
Saturday, the women’s basketball
team fell to the Bellarm ine
Knights 78-55.
The Cougars trailed most of
the game, except when they tied
the game at 20-20 midway
through the first half. After a
missed free throw from the
Knights, Whitney Sykes shot a 3pointer to take the lead. It was the
only time the Cougars led the
game, but the Knights answered
right back and finishedup the half
37-27.

The Knights extended their
lead on a 30-10 run against the
Cougars. The Cougars were not
able to cut the lead as the game
played on.
Sykes finished the day with
17 points and four assists. She
also hit five o f nine 3-pointers.
Also adding to the score was
sophomore forward Julianne
McMillen who scored 12 points
and made three steals and junior
forward Alisa Carrillo who
notched 12 points as well, along
with five rebounds.
The Cougars came home
Thursday after a key win against
the University of Missouri-St.
Louis Riverwomen the previous
weekend, but fell to the KWC
Panthers 64-50.
Head coach Wendy Hedberg
said the culprit of this game was
building a lead and not hanging
on to it.

The SIUE track teams
notched
another
strong
performance at the Eastern
Illinois University Friday Night
Special over the weekend.
The meet prepared the
Cougars track teams for the Great
Lakes Valley Conference Indoor
Cham pionship
this
coming
weekend at Wabash College in
Crawfordsville, Ind.
“On paper, the m en’s and
women’s team are both favored
in the top two to win conference,”
track coach Ben Beyers said.
“As
defending
cham ps,
both teams know what we need to
do. We have a target on our
back.”
The track teams had a last
opportunity to practice for
conference championship at the
Friday Night Special.

The m en’s team took full
advantage of this opportunity and
had a successful weekend.
Sophomore Cody Ellerm eyer
placed first in the 800-meter run
with a time of 1 hour, 55 minutes,
28 seconds.
The men’s 400-meter relay
sqaud placed third in the
com petition and broke its
provisional national qualifying
time. The men’s distance medley
relay squad placed second at the
meet.
Sophomore Anthony Weber
placed first in the pole vault and
tied the school record with a
height of 15 feet, 5.75 inches.
The women had a triumphant
performance as well.
Senior Lee Ann Lomax won
the 800 with a 2:18.75 time, and
the w om en’s 400-m eter relay
crew placed first and broke its
national qualifying time record

Baseball opens season on rough note

S ports R e p o r te r

The SIUE baseball team
opened the season with two
losses this weekend at the TVA
Federal Credit Union Invitational
in Florence, Ala.
The Cougars traveled down
to the U niversity o f North
Alabama Saturday and fell to
boththe Lions 7-1 and the No. 2
ranked Delta State University
Statesmen 8-1.
In the first game of
Saturday’s tripleheader, the
Cougars managed just one run on

seven hits before he left in the
middle of the second inning with
his team down 6-0.
“(Keller) learned more from
this than if he would have been
successful,” Collins said of the
young left-hander. “Now he
knows it’ll be harder, but I’m
sure he’ll be better.”
SIUE junior relief pitcher
Cameron Cheek took the mound
in the bottom o f the second
inning with two outs and a runner
on and finished with three 1/3
solid innings pitched, silencing
the Lions’ bats on one run and
two hits.

he held SIUE

finishing the day with six

SIUE Sophomore utility
player Michael DalPozzo singled
in the sixth inning for the
Cougars’ first hit of the game,
followed by a solo home run by
SIUE junior designated hitter
Robert Rahn in the seventh in the
offensive effort.
“We found out what w e’ve
got to work on,” said Collins.
“And w e’ve got to get better with
our offense.”

notching a 26-9 record.
“We just did not swing the

perform ance. “ I was (more)
encouraged by the pitching. I
think our pitching was better than
the score(s) indicated. “

pitcher
Patrick Keller had a rough outing
in his first collegiate start, lasting
just less than two innings. Keller
surrendered five earned runs and

scoring four runs off three hits
and two throwing errors by junior
catcher Jake Smith.
“We got some bad hops that
cost us about seven runs,” Collins
said of the Cougars" fielding over

Sunday’s games were called
off as a result of the rain. The
Cougars were scheduled for a

points and took down 11
rebounds in the game, the 107th
of his career. The game was also
a record for most games and
starts as a Cougar.
“I thought he played an
outstanding game,” Simmons said.
Throughout the first half,
both sides battled with SIUE
responding to every shot,
including a tiebreaker from Tyson
Martin of KWC with 7 minutes,
59 seconds left in the half. A free
throw by Heimos and a jumper,
as part of his 17-point night, by
freshman guard J.B. Jones started
the Cougars’ biggest run of the
game. Not even the Panthers
could stop the Cougars at this
point.
Simmons noted that there
was not much difference between
both teams at home than there
was on Jan. 22 at KWC, when
SIUE edged for the 66-64 win.
“I thought we guarded just a
little bit better and we were able
to get better control of the game,”
Simmons said. “As the second
half went on, we just did a good

job making decisions and on the
spots we needed on offense.”
Junior forward Justin Ward
picked up 12 points off the bench
and Heimos recorded all sixes
with six points, rebounds and
blocks.
With now just two games to
go in the season, Simmons hopes
to avenge the team’s home loss to
Indianapolis University Jan. 29
and attempt 22 wins there.
The Cougars already made a
mark with 20 wins Thursday for
the first time since the 1989-90
season.
“I think our guys are
excited,”
Simmons
said.
“(Indianapolis) is a good team,
well-coached and has got one of
the best players in the GLVC and
maybe in the country in (senior
All-American) David Logan.
“Hopefully we can set things
up and do a better job containing
him,” he said.
The 25th-ranked Cougars
start their last road trip of the
season at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in
Indianapolis, Ind.

“We started off really good
with a 19-8 run on (KW C),”
Hedberg said. “Then we went
for a long stretch o f (no
scoring).”
The Cougars fell into a
slump and only scored two points
in five minutes late in the
first half while the Panthers
caught up to them. A foul by
KWC sent Carrillo to the foul
line where she made both free
throws to jump-start the rest of
the team. Additional free throws
by Sykes put the Cougars up 2724 entering halftime.
The
first-half
results
motivated Hedberg and the
Cougars to continue forward the
rest of the game.
“We were up at half and felt
like we could make good
adjustments in the second
half,” Hedberg said.
However, within the first
minute of the second half, KWC
hit a game tying 3-pointer.
Minutes later the Panthers took
the lead and the Cougars could
not recover.
The Cougars were, at one
point, down by 14 while only
shooting 32 percent from the

field.
Carrillo was the leading
scorer, notching 11 points and
nabbing two blocks. Sykes
complemented Carrillo with
seven points and seven rebounds.
Junior guards Amber Wisdom
and Lindy Carey and sophomore
guard Jamie Kennedy each had
six points.
Hedberg said she felt the
game could have gone the
Cougars’ way
with
more
coverage on defense.
“Only two kids really hurt us
the whole game,” Hedberg said.
“(KWC center Mary Czamecki)
had 23 and (KWC forward
LaTasha Henry) had 17. We
really needed to stop them.”
SIUE moves to 6-12 in the
Great Lakes Valley Conference,
11-16 overall, and remains tied
with Southern Indiana University
in eighth place after defeating
UMSL Saturday.
The Cougars hit the road
