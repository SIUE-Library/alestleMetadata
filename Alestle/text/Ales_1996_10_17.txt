Derogatory letters concern housing residents
By Melanie Adams
Editor in Chief
A recent letter given to students living in the
Residence Hall regarding derogatory notes left on
some residents’ doors has some student residents
feeling better about the situation and yet others
feeling confused.
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, N arbeth
E m m anuel sent the letter afte r receiving
complaints from some of the residents that there
have been derogatory statem ents w ritten on their
dry erase boards hanging on their doors.
O ne stud ent, who would like to rem ain
anonymous, said that this is not the first time she
has received a derogatory message on her door.
“The first message I received, was the word
‘dyke’ w ritten on my board in big letters. The latest
message, was written shortly after I broke up with
my girlfriend. It was in perm anent m arker.”

A fter the most recent message, the student
decided enough was enough and reported the
incident to the police. A nd then to the Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs. This was not the
first complaint by a Resident Hall student that
Em m anuel has received. A nother student also
spoke to him in regards to a derogatory message.
Em m anuel then took it upon himself to write a
letter to residents in the Residence Hall to let them
know that this type of behavior is unacceptable. The
letter also cited five community expectations that
the entire university needs to strive to maintain.
“Recently, your fellow students were the victims
of incidents both deeply troubling and saddening
...” E m m an uel’s letter began. “A nonym ous,
derogatory notes were attached to their doors.
Frightening ... of course. Intim idating ... no doubt.
Harassing ... certainly. Such behaviors will not be
tolerated nor condoned, and such actions will be
responded to with swift and just action.”
The letter was only the beginning of the actions

that Em m anuel and Acting A ssistant Provost for
Cultural and Social Diversity, Rudy Wilson took to
rectify this situation. They also m et with Residence
H all staff and groups of residents for counseling on
the subject.
Wilson and E m m anuel have also vowed to
continue support services for the injured people
and continue to provide the educational tools, such
as diversity training, to try to com bat this problem.
Steve Anning, a freshman residing in the Hall,
said that the letter came as a surprise to him and
that he felt that there wasn’t any tension between
students in the Residence Hall that he was aware
of.
“If there is tension betw een the students, I don’t
think that a letter from the Vice Chancellor (for
Student Affairs) will take the tension away and
m ake the letters stop,” Anning said.
Freshm en Sarah Burton and Suman Navalgund
said that they had no idea why they were receiving

v i c t i m s o f domestic violence

Singled Out!

Bob Fehringer/A/esf/e

Emita Meeks, University Center Board Coordinator, acts as Master of Ceremonies
during the "Singled Out" dating game held in the Goshen Lounge Wednesday
afternoon. "Singled Out" was a take-off on a game on MTV by the same name. In
"Singled Out," a couple gets to know each other through a series of questions and a
process of "singling out" one person from a group.

Sticks and stones may break your bones and so can your lover.
A pproxim ately every 15 seconds, a woman is battered. FBI crime
statistics for 1991 reveal that 28 percent of all female m urder victims
are slain by their husbands or partners. Studies show that only 5
percent of domestic violence victims are men, according to Suzanne
H uebner, a public safety counselor at SIUE. But what the statistics
d on’t include are the thousands of violent acts that go unreported.
“Victims have crazy sounding excuses like ‘I ran into the d oo r’.
They are always blaming themselves for the violence,” H uebner said.
M ental abuse may be the reason behind the self-blame.
“A lot of times the perpetrato r will tell the victim things like, ‘Why
would anyone else want to be with you?’, ‘You will never find anyone
else to take care of you like 1 do,’ or ‘W ho else would want you with
two kids?”’ H uebner said.
Many people don’t realize that continued statem ents like these are
a form of abuse. A nd, H uebner said, the mental abuse is m ore severe
and prolonged than the physical abuse.
“It belittles the victim and makes her feel trapped,” she said.
Once abuse starts, it seldom stops. In fact, domestic violence often
escalates.
“Just because he doesn’t put you in the hospital doesn’t mean it can’t
be worse,” Huebner said.“ You have to drag yourself up by the bootstraps,
get out, and get on with your life.”
She said students looking for help can contact Counseling Services
on campus, notify the police departm ent or call one of the w om en’s
groups listed in the phone book.

Disgraced admiral accused of
affair

Frat house fire, set by arsonist, injures 1

AP — Richard Macke, an admiral who resigned in disgrace as U.S.
Pacific commander earlier this year for making insensitive remarks
about a rape case, is now accused of having an affair with a female
subordinate. The affair with the Marine Corps officer allegedly began
a year before Macke and his wife divorced in 1995. A year long
investigation by the Secretary of Navy’s office found that Macke made
over 850 long-distance calls to the woman on military phones and only
partially reimbursed the government.

AP— A fraternity house at Illinois State University may
have been set by an arsonist, authorities said Tuesday.
Normal Police Capt. Gary Speers said there were no suspects
in last week’s fire at Phi Sigma Kappa. Inspectors found
traces of a highly inflammable substance in the room where
the fire started. One student suffered serious injuries in the
fire. A reward up to $10,000 for information on the case is
being offered.

Indonesian president defends East Timor rule
D ILI — President Suharto was in East Timor Tuesday, never once
mentioning the territory’s 21-year-old fight for independence.
Suharto was in East Timor to inaugurate a giant statue of Jesus
Christ, a gesture of religious tolerance. He took a helicopter ride with
Bishop Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo but, said Belo, made no comment
about the Nobel Peace Prize Belo and resistance leader Jose RamosH orta received last week.
East Timor was annexed by Indonesia in 1976, a year after its
invasion during a civil war that ended 400 years of Portuguese rule.

COLLINSVILLE — An elderly couple walking along the
trails at Cahokia Mounds said they came upon a naked man.
When they spotted him, they said he began performing a
lewd act. Police searched for the man but could not find him.
Correction
In the Oct. 8 issue o f the Ales tie, Randy Rock was incorrectly named as
Vice-Chancellor o f Student Affairs, which is Narbeth Emmanuel^ title.
Rock’s actual title is Associate Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs. The

Alestle regrets the error and hopes it did not cause any embarrassment.

Women have the right to choose abortions

Media portrays negative
image of sororities and
Greeks in general

It’s my Body! It is, or is
it? I can do w hat I want with
it! I can, o r can you?
I am writing in response
to the letter by Brian
Schuetz in the O ctober 8th
issue of the Alestle. First of
all a wom an is equal to man,
huh? T hen why is she still
paid less than he is and for
the sam e job? Because a
woman is not equal to a
man; but yes she is superior
to a child, until that child is
an adult and even then she is
still superior. W omen have
and continue’s to fight for an
equality that continues to be
withheld from them by the
very voices that seek to
control her body and her
life. W hatever happened to
the right of privacy and
freedom of choice?
We have euthanasia and
the death penalty; but
because abortion deals
entirely with a w om an body
then that act is considered
undesirable and not a

choice. You do as you please
with your body when it’s
constitutional but when we
do as we please with o u r’s
then it’s unconstitutional.
You said that women
shouldn’t be denied their
rights, just for being women.
But no one should be denied
their rights just for being
them . If wom en shouldn’t be
denied their rights then what
do you think illegalizing
abortion is? D enied rights.
We rant about her choice
but w hether abortion
rem ains legal or becomes
illegal we m ust realize that
abortions have existed even
through their illegal days
and do you think that a few
pro-lifers, you, or the
governm ent will truly stop a
wom an fro m aborting? No.
So the issue's isn’t should we
let her abort, because it is
not your choice; but the
issue is should we continue
to let her abort safely.
Because many women died
as a result of ¡legalization

by participating in back alley
abortions and if we illegalize
it once again, then many
m ore will die.
Society has become too
controlling over other
people when we as a society
can’t even control our own
situations or selves. We kill
bugs that irks us and animals
for food, isn’t that a life?
T hen what sin have we all
com m itted? O r was it no sin
just the right to eat. Had
they no choice? Killing is
killing—so instead of just
looking at or pointing the
finger at wom en who have
abortions, let’s look at
ourselves and society. The
death penalty like abortion
kills innocents, but whose
right is it really to decide the
death of another? Yours,
mine, the governm ent, the
jury, the judge, o r G od? I
know it’s not mine, do you?

This letter is in response to the Thursday edition concerning
the “T hree C harged in T h e ft.....” S orority m em bers

letter to the editor

‘S tar W ars’ n o t a b o u t se x u a lity
In the Oct. 10 edition of the Alestle, Corey
Stulce w rote an article about sexuality in the
‘Star W ars’ trilogy. First and forem ost, he is
obviously not as big of a fan as he claims, for if
he were, he would know that the kiss betw een
Luke and Leia is in the 2nd movie (The
Em pire Strikes Back) and not in the 1st (as he
stated).
As animals, hum ans are sexual creatures;
thus, som etimes there will be sexual overtones
to our literature, o ur music, and our films. The
problem arises when one perceives sex in
practically everything th at surrounds them.
This is the case with Mr. Stulce’s article on ‘Star
Wars.’
For example, he states that the light saber is
“the phallic w eapon of choice” for a Jedi. The
light saber is no m ore than a futuristic sword.
T here are many things which can be construed
as phallic symbols: guns, the X-Wing fighter,
the Y-Wing fighter, the S tar D estroyer,
everyone’s arms and legs, spanners, D arth
Vader’s helm et, the speeder bikes, Jabba the
H utt, screw drivers, soda bottles, candles,
rem ote controls, bananas, cucumbers, and etc.
As for the ‘incestuous’ part of the trilogy,
would it have been m ore believable for Luke
to have played a eunuch than to be infatuated
by a beautiful, unknow n girl? The kiss betw een
Luke and Leia m ade the com petition betw een
H an Solo and Luke m ore believable. U p until
‘R eturn of the Jedi’ no one suspected that
Luke and Leia were bro th er and sister, m aking
the rev elatio n m ore surprising for the
audience.
A nd where does Mr. Stulce come up with
the idea of sexual tension betw een R2-D2 and

C -3PO, two gender-neutral droids? C-3PO
does have a male voice but that is most likely a
product of the still chauvinistic 1970s. H e is not
like D ata of Star Trek: T N G who was all the
functions of a m ale hum anoid. R2-D2 doesn’t
even have a ‘speaking voice.’ How can Mr.
Stulce tell what gender this droid is? The fact
that C-3PO refers to R2-D2 as “h e ” is not
conclusive, however; again, the m ale-oriented
1970s attitude (and perhaps a bit of bad script
writing) are m ore likely at fault. These two
droids are pre-program m ed and do not possess
consciences. R2-D2 is program m ed to serve
Luke and “risks his neck” only because he has
to (not out of som e deep-rooted sexual desire
for Luke). A nd where does C -3PO ’s jealously
enter into the scenario? Just give me one
example.
With is it with Mr. Stulce and triangles? Is he
Pythagoras? First Luke, C-3PO and R2-D2
have a m enage-a-droid, then H an Solo,
C hew bacca, and Leia have a tete-a-tete.
Chewbacca is ‘close’ to H an Solo because of
the life-debt he owes to Solo. H an had
originally freed
C hew bacca from
his
enslavem ent by the Imperials.
I realize that Mr. Stulce’s article was not
m eant to be taken seriously (at least I hope it
w asn’t), and thus my rebuttal is simply m eant
to be argum entative and corrective. So, my
response is in the same light vein as Mr.
Stulce’s.
M ay the knowledge be with you.

dom estic violence.
“The abuse started when we were dating. It
wasn’t blatantly bad,” she said.The student, who
wished to remain anonymous, said the abuse
worsened as time passed.
Michelle Schiller-Baker is an expert in the
field of dom estic violence, and is the director of
St. M artha’s Hall, a battered w om an’s shelter in
St. Louis.s.
“This issue boils down to pow er and
control,” Schiller-Baker said. “If a m an is an
abuser, he will use pow er and control in every
way that he can.”
“A nyone who calls and checks up on you or
follows you to work is not good for you,” the
student said, “A nd any m an who ever hits you
and says it will never happen again, is a liar. It
m akes it easier for the next tim e.” She warned
against m en who want to control w here you go,
what you see, who you are with, and where, or
if, you work.
Counseling has been a m ajor part of h er life
as a result of the abuse. She said it takes a long
time to recover and even then, the victims are
scarred psychologically as well as physically.
“W omen with a history of child abuse, low
self-esteem , and a need to be loved are
especially vulnerable. M ore than likely they
won’t see it them selves, but if a friend o r loved
one notices these behaviors, they need to pay
attention,” the student said.
Schiller-B aker has seen w om en in the
shelter ranging from age 18 to 76, and at all
stages of the abusive situation Some leave the
relationship before the abuse begins, some
m anage to leave during an episode and others
arrive at the shelter because they have reached
their breaking point, she said.
A w om an’s presence at St. M arth a’s Hall is
kept confidential so that she can feel safe. Staff

p rovide counseling and education, give
em otional support and inform wom en of legal
options o r remedies.
“T here is nothing you did to cause him to be
violent, and there is nothing you can do to get
him to stop,” said Schiller-Baker. “H e has the
problem .”
She said the best thing wom en can do is to
get o u t of p o ten tially life-threatening
situations, but she also added that wom en stay
in abusive situations for a num ber of reasons,
including finances, fear, love and children.
“B ut,” Schiller-Baker was quick to say, “he
can’t be a good dad and beat you!”
She encourages p eo p le to be alert for
violence on television, a factor she said which
has b een p ro v en to increase violence in
aggressive individuals.
“Follow up when you see violence on TV.
W rite letters to the editor or to TV stations.
Also, call elected officials in your area to see
w hat legislation is going on in your area to
decrease violence. T h en ask how he (the
politician) is going to vote on that legislation,”
Schiller-Baker said.
Counseling Services, in conjunction with
University Police, will be hosting a series of
sem inars dealing with topics on sexual and
dom estic violence. “Sexual A ssault is a
C R IM E !” will be held Oct. 23 at 6:30 p.m. in
the Com m ons TV Lounge.
O thers are: “Preventing D ate R ape,” Nov. 6
and “Sexual H arassm en t and H um an
R elations,” Nov. 20, both at Tower Lake. In
addition, dom estic violence will be discussed in
the Soup and Substance Series on Nov. 19 in
the Cahokia Room.

seminars, contact Counseling Services at 6922197.

Chekhov's 'Sea G u ll" has smooth landing
By Marlin Thomas
For the Alestle

It was a sm ooth landing for A nton C hekhov’s
play “The Sea Gull.”. His not so norm al play landed
onto the stage of the SIU E Com m unications
Building T h eater last Saturday for its first w eekend
run.
D irector W illiam G rivna brought C hekhov’s work
to life as seen Friday night. The wild assortm ent of
characters were introduced through the talent of
the on-point cast. The play featured a m ixture of
com edy and seriousness as well.
The entire cast w orked to display the complexities
of C hekhov’s play. O ne of the best perform ances
belonged to D onna Parrone. P arrone was the
attention hungry m other and actress, A rkadina.
T here was not one scene w here her actions and
dress were dow nplayed A rkadina’s son, K onstantin
(M atthew Young) was another character that was
impressive. His sadness and his drive for success in
life was only shadow ed by his obsession for the
lovely Nina (M ichelle Tesdall).Tesdall’s
perform ance show ed N ina’s optim istic portrayal of
a happy and productive future. Nina was like a
character from a fairytale in the real world.
A n o th er character, M asha (Kim berly H oey), was
basically depressed. She wore black all of the time
because she was “m ourning h er life”, and the
character really cam e alive. The old m an, Sorin
(Jeffrey Yapp), was the ow ner of the country estate
where the action takes place. H e was one of the

funniest characters, with his wild
com m ents and actions.
Two characters that expressed
a lot of thought-provoking
dialogue were a novelist,
Trigorin (Michael Szeles), and a
doctor, D orn (Jeffrey Skoblow).
Their perform ances and
dialogue grabbed my com plete
attention as soon as they
appeared on stage. The m arried
couple, Polina (Sandra Stover)
and Sham rayev (John Buxton
Jr.), provided interesting action
within the play. All of these
many characters and a few m ore
created a wonderful show.
The minimalistic stage scenery
m ade my eyes pay m ore
attention to the actors. This
provided for a highly
imaginative set and it m ade the
characters the most
im portant.of the two. The
lighting and sound were
spectacular; both of them m ade
me feel a part of the action. The
Bill Brinson/UNS
costum es fit each one of the
The actors from Anton Chekhov's 'The Sea Gull". The play runs until

details did the trick.
So, if you want to see a clear,
thoughtful production this
perform ance of C hekhov’s “The Sea G ull” is
weekend, this is the show for you. This
definitely w orth it!

Settie ‘Rains’ on the crowd Mexica 1995:
Reflections of an
adventure in Mexico

By Matthew Veenstra
For the Alestle
Tuesday evening at the U niversity
R e sta u ra n t ap proxim ately 50 students
experienced a “show ercase” by Settie.
Settie was the highlight of the evening at a
show case hosted by UCB. S ettie sang a
touching a capella version o f “I ’m Just a Little
Black Rain C loud,” from W innie the Pooh to
accent the night.
Settie is a traveling acoustic rock duo from
M assachusetts. T heir act has been on the road
m aking stops at over 125 college campuses,
not to m ention various vacation resorts this
past sum m er. The duo perform s original tunes
and boasts a sound that covers musical giants
such as The B eatles and Janis Joplin, with a
little Jimi H endrix and Patsy Cline throw n in
betw een.
The evening began w ith an open mic
featuring local musicians. As the audience
sipped their tea or coffee and snacked on
their cookies, they w ere entertained by a solo
perform ance of “H ide Your Love Away”,
recorded by The Beatles. The final open mic
perform er was Universal G roove who played
a catchy original entitled, “Toilet Clogging
Junkie”, a hum orous tune about a sweet
m ate’s sour bathroom habits.
A fter this brief opening, vocalist Settie and
gu itarist B rian Fellows en te rta in e d the
audience with lively inspirational -music. Their
varied style of songs w ere originals off of
their three current albums.

Acoustic Rock Star Settie.

The evening was great and S e ttie ’s
perform ance .was wonderful. The showcase
was an excellent evening of m usic and
entertainm ent.

W hat’s great, FREE, exciting, and only a few steps away?
The New W agner G allery is decked out with bright colors,
filled with artifacts and art objects inspired by the land on the
other side of the Rio G rande. Mexica 1995 is m ore than just an
exhibition o f P re-C olum bian artifacts, pottery, and jade
carvings; it’s a chance for S IU E stu dents to experience
beautiful, thought provoking works of art.
For three weeks in 1995 students and faculty from the A rt
and Design D epartm ent went to M exico to experience the
country’s culture. Professor of A rt and Design, Paul Dresang,
states in the exhibit introduction, Mexico is a “country of
com plex contrasts. . .poverty and gross inequality”. Their
im pressions of th e co n trasts ex perienced on th eir trip
influenced the works of art they created upon returning. These
resulting works are displayed in this unique exhibition.
The earliest m edium s are utilized in their creations. The
pottery pieces include the m ost basic m eans of firing, salt, wood
and stone. The colors show great contrast from the m uted
pastels of the pottery: the bare, charred and carved wooden
surfaces, the bright colors done with pastels and watercolors,
not to m ention the bold yarn in the fabrics.
Two unusual pieces include A ncient Futures, by Laura
Strand and W oman Finishing, by Sarah Nashold. S trand’s print
includes the symbolism of an ancient spear point, and the future
by the use of geom etric patterns, fibers and a delicate lace
handkerchief. N ashold’s art features a female weaving textile
m aterial by hand. This is in contrast with the new technology of
pixel-based imagery used in the work.
The com bination of artifacts and art is m ore than reason
enough to take a leisurely walk to the New W agner G allery and
experience Mexica 1995.

Boys Choir is a “Sound o f Hope
By i y Norris
Lifestyle Editor
H e rald in g from the stree ts of
H arlem is The Boys C hoir of
H arlem ’s first solo album , “The Sound
o f H o p e”.
The album , released by EastW est
Records, offers a blend of music from
pop and R& B to jazz and gospel. The
latest
pro ject
also
features
appearances from noted music greats
such as R & B recording artist
D ’A ngelo (B row n Sugar) and gospel
singer tu rn ed p ro d u c er M ervyn
W arren (form er m em ber of a cappella
group, Take 6) just to nam e a couple.
Founded nearly 25 years ago by Dr.
W alter J. Turnball, a nationally know n
educator, conductor and tenor, as the
Ephesus C hurch Boys Choir, The
Boys C hoir of H arlem has grown
trem endously, securing them a slot as
one of the nations leading perform ing
ensembles.
Turnball started the choir as an

alternative to hanging out on the
streets. So, with hope, he turned a
group of rowdy boys into a choir in

the basem ent of the Ephesus church.
Boasting a reputation of producing
decades of progress and expansion,

The Boys C hoir of H arlem states that
it isn’t just about music; it’s about
hope. This hope is m ark ed and
characterized by many of the cuts
such as: “I Trust In G o d ”, “Power” and
“R ough Crossing”.
“The Sound of H o p e’s” first cut,
“H eroes”, sets the tone o f the album
with explosive lyrics such as: Black
boys are born of heroes, ancient
heroes, biblical heroes, historical
heroes, present-day heroes, explorers,
scientists, navigators. . to begin its
quest of hope.
To its listeners, “All
Black Boys are B orn
H e ro e s” tends
to
produce feelings of
worth and identity of
not only who you are,
but where you came
from.

Some years back, my life as I knew it, ended. “The Facts of
Life” ended its run on NBC. I was crushed! W here would I
get my Tootie cravings relinquished? For years, I was a shell.
Recently, however, I acquired some im portant investigative
reporting skills. My search for the characters of “The Facts of
Life” began. I ignored the later seasons with Cloris Leachm an
and G eorge Clooney. W ho cares about them anyway? I
started with the big gun, m atriarch E dna G arret.
The search for Mrs. G a rrett ended in the small town of
Peachville, Georgia. Mrs. G arrett had reopened her business,
“E d n a’s Edibles,” but instead of a bakery, it was now a
brothel. She goes under the nam e M ama G, now. She still
uses her m otherly skills to teach a new generation of girls the
ropes.
Blair W arner and Tootie m oved to New York City to carry
out their dreams. Blair lived off her fath er’s money for a
while, but soon she discovered the needy people in the city
streets. She form ed a charity in order to help the homeless,
which her father put a quick stop to. H e cut her off from her
funds. D evastated by a life of poverty, she went mad, and
ended up in the streets herself. She now spends h er time
eating Styrofoam peanuts and selling her hair for nickels.
Tootie pursued an acting career, and found some acclaim as
D orothy in an off-off-Broadway production of “The Wiz”. H er
life took a tu rn for the worse when she discovered the
dangerous high of sniffing airplane m odel glue. She was last
reported to be seeking treatm ent.
Jo went to work for her father, Alex Rocco, who had mob
ties. R em em ber, he got shot through the eye in the movie
“The G odfather.” She becam e a very successful hitman.
Unfortunately, N atalie G reen, w ho becam e a reporter, was
trying to uncover a story o n the mob. Jo, just doing her job,
had to take her out. Original season cast m em ber Molly
Ringwald was the only one to attend the funeral.
A h well, you take the good, you take the bad, you take
them both, and there you have the facts of life.

Bad weather and
Bellarmine hurts
Cougars in tourney
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The S IU E w om en’s tennis team rounded out
their fall season by finishing seventh in the G reat
Lakes Valley C onference T ournam ent at Lewis
U niversity last weekend.
O n Thursday, the No. 6 ranked Cougars not only
had to deal with third-ranked Bellarm ine in the
first round, but they also had to fight the cold
w eather conditions.
SIU E lost all of their doubles m atches against
B ellarm ine to give the three seed a quick three
point lead.
The Cougars couldn’t m anage a victory in single
either. They lost their first two m atches which gave
B ellarm ine the five points necessary to move on in
the winners bracket.
“The key was to win the doubles m atches and
we d idn’t do it,” head coach Bill Logan said. “The
cold w eather affected us and when we lost in dou­
bles o ur m om entum was gone.”
F riday’s contest put S IU E against seventhranked-IU PU -Ft. Wayne.
Sarah H ardim on and C hristy Ulavege got the
ball rolling for S IU E with a 8-3 win at No. 1 dou­
bles. IU PU -Ft. Wayne countered by taking the
o th er two doubles matches.
In singles, H ardim on was victorious 6-2, 6-0 in
the No. 1 spot, Ulavege got past her opponent 6-4,
6-3 at two singles, and No. 6 player, Erica Conway,

Men’s cross country jumps to No. 25 after 2nd place finish
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
A dd another C ougar sport to
the national rankings.
The SIU E m en’s cross country
team took second place over the
w eekend at the C entral Missouri
State Invitational and ended up
25th in the nation .
“Pittsburg State was the only
college team to beat us. We beat
four other team s in the region
and it gave us national ranking,”
head coach D arryl F rerker said.
Travis R oundcount led the
charge for the Cougars, coming in
6th overall.
Right behind R oundcount was
G us C oronado who came in 7th.
C raig Firkins, Tony Jenkins,
and G eorge Patrylak rounded out
S IU E ’s to p five, placing 18th,
25th, and 27th respectively.
The invitational included 10
colleges, but also had people ru n ­
ning independently that were not
added into the individual and
team results.

“Overall this was a great race
and great win,” F rerker said.
O n the w om en's side, the
Cougars finished 5th overall and
F rerker said the wom en didn’t
run the race the way they are
capable.
“We can run stronger than we
did. We seem ed tired out there
and we just didn’t put together a
race like we can,” F rerker said.
Vicki Johnson lead the way for
the Cougars as she finished 16th
overall.
K endra Newell was close
behind, finishing 18th.
Also, Nichole D one finished
25th overall.
