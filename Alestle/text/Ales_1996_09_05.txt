Starting today, the Southwestern
Illinois Regional celebrates their 18th
annual Senior Olympics.
The Olympics are running on
campus from today through Sunday.
This is the last regional Olympics in
the state before the start of the
Illinois Senior Olympics held
Septem ber 19-22 in Springfield,
Illinois.
With the majority of events set to
be held on the campus, SIUE will be
in a constant spotlight.
Paula
Kanyo,
Community

and
Public
Service
Coordinator, describes the purpose
behind the senior Olympics.
“We tried to get events in that
some people didn’t have to have a lot
of physical dexterity. Some of the
participants are very athletic, some
have trained for months,” Kanyo said.
K anyo’s
job
includes
administration of the non-academic
senior programs. She also works with
seniors in the community.
“However my main function lately
has been prom oting the Senior

Among them
are horseshoes,
shuffleboard, frisbee, discus throwing,
mini-golf, softball and football
distance throwing.
Also the O lym pics are bringing
back bicycle races after a few years
off the circuit.
“Along with the regular events, we
have added some fun things this
year,” Kanyo said.
O ther events scheduled includes a
dinner and dance at the Eden Village

The first event is golf at the
Tamarack Golf Course at 8:00 a.m.

Credit card companies target students
A T-shirt could mean a lifetime of debt for many college students
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
Students beware: free T-shirts may result in an
accumulation of credit card debt.
New studies indicate that full-time students and
people who make less than $10,000 annually are
being pursued by credit card companies.
Why do companies such as MasterCard©, VISA
© and American Express© target these groups?
George Ritzer, professor at the University of
Maryland and author of a book about the social
impact of credit card growth, says the banking
business has “gone from a business of inducing
people to save to inducing people to go into debt.”
Most college students lack the necessary income
to cover credit card balances. Often, they pay the
minimum balance and let the interest accrue. The
common hope is that a diploma will lead to a big job,
big bucks and repayment of credit card balances.
Melissa Mills, a senior in the mass

Ogoni people.

communications department, said credit cards led
her down a path to consumer debt.
“I got my first credit card when I was 18 and was
attending junior college. Within a year, I had three
VISAs and six store cards.”
By the time Mills was 22, she was thousands of
dollars in debt. “I had a good job, but was too young
to handle credit wisely,” she said. “I went crazy and
have nothing to show for it now but a bad credit
report.”
With interest rates as high as 18 percent,
consumers sometimes find themselves paying for
something a long time after receiving the goods.
Credit card companies seem to be enticing students
with what seems to be as good as cash. But what are
the consequences?
According to an article in August, consumer debt
has exploded in the past several years.
USA T O D A Y personal finance reporter
Christine Dugas said, “Consumer debt has surged
39 percent in the last five years and now totals more

than $1 trillion, a sum that exceeds the annual
economic output of many nations.”
Even though Bankcard Holders of America and
other groups criticize card issuers for encouraging
young people to rack up a balance, credit card firms
continue to recruit new users on campuses.
Robert McKinley, president of a credit card
research firm in Frederick, Md., says research
indicates consumers are loyal to their first credit
card. So credit card firms are launching campaigns
on campuses nationwide.
Randy Smith, a double major in anthropology
and music, avoids credit cards. Although he receives
credit card applications in the mail on a
weekly basis, Smith has resisted the temptation to
charge up a future of debt.
“The interest rate is outrageous. Everything you
need to know tends to be in the small print,” he said.

Save the Ogoni people, stop buying Shell gasoline
By Scott Anderson
Photographer
Never in your life might you be
able to positively affect so many
people with so little effort. This was the
message that I walked away with last
Thursday night after a Sierra Club
meeting at Belleville Area College.
The meeting was held to discuss the
environmental and human devastation
of the Ogoni people of Nigeria at the
hands of the Nigerian military
dictatorship and Shell Oil.
This was no ordinary meeting
where environm entalists become
informed on local or global issues, it
was an educational meeting in which
six members of the Movement for the
Survival of
the Ogoni People
(MOSOP) who fled Nigeria and are
living in exile in St. Louis under
United Nations protection asked for
assistance in their struggle.
Before I go any further I should
explain why the problems of Nigeria
are relevant to you and a little of how
easily you can help. The environmental
destruction, terrorism, and murder in
Ogoniland is happening for only one
reason, oil, which equals money and
power.
As the major consumer of Nigerian
oil, you and I as Americans bear as
much
responsibility
for
the
devastation of the Ogoni as the people
we pay to do it, Shell Oil and the
Nigerian government.
The first simple thing that you can
do to stop the Ogoni people’s
oppression is to stop paying for it; stop
buying gasoline from Shell. Just drive
on by.
D on’t stop reading here, there is
more to all of this and much more you
can do that is as simple as boycotting
Shell.
Noble Obani Nwibari (VicePresident of M OSOP), his wife
Florence, and four other Nigerians in
exile were at BAC last Thursday night
to show us film that had been
smuggled out of Nigeria and shown on
British t.v. and to tell first hand of their
own experiences in Nigeria.
As I watched their film and listened
to their words, I saw images that
almost defied belief. Imagine the
refineries and fires of wood river, fifty
times larger, in your back yard.
Imagine huge pipelines running
past your front door, sometimes
bursting, spilling oil into your living
room or into the river where your
water comes from. You stand and
watch as the oil spills out onto the

The nam e A lestle is an

of the three campus locations of

crops that were to feed you for that
year. This is only half of the problems
of the Ogoni People. The other half is
their
governm ent,
a
military
dictatorship that is funded by revenue
from oil pum ped from under the
Ogoni.
This dictatorship is run by Gen. Sani
Abacha, who jailed the country’s
elected president, and tolerates no
interference with the oil production
that pays for his guns and Mercedes.
To understand the situation we
have to look at Shell Oil, Nigeria, the
U.S., and MOSOP in the past and in
the present. Nigeria is located in West
Africa,
where
many
African
Americans come from. It lies on the
Niger River and its delta.
Shell came to Nigeria shortly before
Nigeria gained independence in 1964.
Nigeria, and more specifically
Ogoniland, has some of the best oil
and most fertile farmland in Africa
because it sits on the Niger River
Delta.
Oil under Ogoniland is very
valuable because it requires little
processing before it can be used. When
Shell first came to Nigeria it was
thought that the rich natural resource
would bring beneficial development
like schools, universities, hospitals, jobs
and money.
What it brought was a source of
exploitation and corruption for the
power-and-money-hungry
military
leaders of the country. The oil drained
from Ogoniland provides Nigeria’s
gov’t., with $10 billion in revenue,
accounting for 97percent of export
revenue, yet the Ogoni people have no
schools or hospitals(Sierra Club,
H arpers’ /June ‘96). In fact the average
Nigerians’ income is only $300 per
year (H arpers’/June ‘96).
Noble related a personal story of
how Shell told the people that the
crude oil was good for them and that
they should use it to treat upset
stomachs.
Once, when Noble was young, he
became sick, so his parents gave him
some crude oil and it almost killed
him. Shell only cares about profits.
The statistics are horrifying, the U.S.
buys the majority of all oil exported
from Nigeria, but Nigerian oil accounts
for only 3.5 percent of total U.S.
consumed oil. 40 percent of Shells’ oil
leaks and spills occur in Nigeria. In
Nigeria Shell burns off 75 percent of
the natural gas produced in oil
production while only burning 0.4
percent in the U.S.

So while Nigeria’s oil only accounts but Ken Saro Wiwa and eight others
for 3.5 percent of all our oil, Nigerian were tried and hung.
MOSOP is still peacefully fighting
oil production is the single largest
cause of global warming (Sierra Club for the Ogoni Bill of Rights and for
testimony before House Comm, on their lives. Noble said Thursday that
the most important human right is the
International Relations).
The environmental disasters go on. right to a clean environment.

Bad AngeF not too bad
Badalamenti’s music uses the broad strokes that
movie music composers use, to give the music
majestic, celestial qualities. These qualities are
given to songs about living through the world’s
m undane cruelties, of being alone and
forgotten, of being betrayed, of living through it
all.
Romance isn’t just about love between two
people. Romance is life at volume setting 11.
Romance is the home of epiphanies and dreams.
It’s the language of souls, the magnetic impulses
in Kirlian auras, the lunar gravity that tows and
tugs endorphine tides. Romance is a sailor’s
laugh in the face of a hurricane. Romance is
breaking out into song in public, because you
can’t hold the song in any longer.
Not all the songs on “B & BA” are this
potent. All of the songs, however, have a
patience and nobility alien to anything on the
radio. Some songs, especially those songs about
living through the world’s woes, get somber and
slow. But others, like “I Believe” and “Heart,”
soar.
This album’s message may well be lost in
today’s cynical, technologically advanced ears. I
mean, th ere’s nothing to headbang to, no
booming bass to shake the windows. These guys
probably won’t even tour. But if it takes off,
maybe it’ll start something. Film composers adapting
“Sonnets of the Portuguese...” Hey, anything can
happen.

By Greg Levrault
For the Alestle
CD review
“Booth and the Bad Angel”
Romance has gotten soft. Decades of W hitman’s
Samplers, infantile Cupids and Mylar balloons have
made love a pedestrian pursuit, a recreational
activity if one has the time.
Long after Romanticism gave way to Realism in
the world, romance has been delegated to the realm
of pop songs and chic movies. Works about love
today are either bitter, saccharine, or rehearsed to
the point of insincerity. Love today merely means
the attraction between two people (unless you listen
to Christian music, but that’s worse than pop).
Romance today means winning a man or a woman,
and that’s not right at all.
This week, I finally found a piece of work that
remembers what romance is.
A couple of years back, Tim Booth was riding high
with his alternatively categorized music group James
(most popular songs: “Sit Down,” “Laid,” and “Say
Something”). Booth was approached by the BBC;
what artist would he like to collaborate with for a
special concert? Booth immediately m entioned
Angelo Badalamenti (the “bad angel”), a composer
known for his scores for such David Lynch projects
as Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, and Wild at Heart. The
concert didn’t happen, but the two artists managed a
correspondence that led to their collaborative

album.
“Booth and the Bad Angel” is fervently romantic,
in the classic sense. The words alone ring like the
smiling ghosts of Keats and Lord Byron.

please rent the original. The sequel is a rehashed remake, without much of the
charm the first picture had. The story is lame; the cast is bland; and the look is
an obvious rip-off of “Blade Runner.”

The Crow---------------------------------------from page 6

like a decent film, I won’t ruin the predictable ending.
Tim Pope, best known for his Cure music videos, is at the
helm. He was able to capture some very interesting aerial shots,
but that’s about it.
Every scene with characters and dialogue is quite boring, and
even painful to watch. Pope drains all the color from the
scenery, leaving only dull grays and purples. The only real color
is the occasional red fluorescent light. It has a nice look, but,
again, it’s been done before.
The music in the film is another hodgepodge of today’s socalled “alternative” artists, including the band Hole. Most of the
time, the music is too fast-paced for the dreary feel of the film.
At least the original soundtrack had a decent single from Nine
Inch Nails.
This film was supposed to be a career take-off for star Perez,
as the original was supposed to do for the unfortunate Brandon
Lee. Perez, best known for art-house fare like “Queen Margot,”
posed and pouted for the camera just fine. His thick accent and
lack of charm needed for that “I just killed a bad guy, here’s a
witty line” dialogue should keep the audience yawning. This
film needed some semi-known actors to compensate for littleknown Perez. The best known was musician Pop. What a shame.
Fairuza Balk as Sarah and Ving Rhames as Judah would have
given the film some well-needed pep.
The film’s one positive note is only half-positive. The design is
well done, even though it’s too “Blade Runner-esque.” “Blade
Runner” has been a run-down, mechanized, futuristic big city
model since its release in 1982; so it was no surprise to see some
similar aspects in “The Crow 2.” The gothic buildings, complete
with gargoyles, and the street fair lit by fire were very
interesting visual aspects.
Miramax, who released the film, must have been more
interested in money than artistic value for a change. The
original “Crow,” based on the comic by James O ’Barr, was a
love story, with a revenge undercurrent. This film is just overly
violent and haphazardly thrown together. Even die-hard
“Crow” fans could find something more entertaining to do on a
Friday night...C-

What would happen if the country suddenly lost all its electric
power? That’s the question “The Trigger Effect” asks the
movie-going audience.
The idea of a world without power, and the panic it causes was
a great idea for a movie. Unfortunately, the story turns into an
uncomfortable road picture/love triangle with Kyle
MacLachlan, Elisabeth Shue and Dermot Mulrooney. This film
had a good start, a weaker middle and a horrible ending...C+

In an age where bands like Oasis and Pulp hi
albums topping the U.S. charts, is there room for c
more British import? Probably not if it’s Gork

usual syrupy pop songs most recent British bar
have conquered the States with, Gorky has a hi
time deciding what type of music they are.
To be fair, they have a very original sound, which
hard to do these days. It is a very hard sound to enj<
though. Their songs are produced by multi[
sounds: strings, organs, chimes, people speakii
horns. Sometimes the music melds together a
makes a tolerable sound. At other times, it sounds
if someone let their cat play with the keyboard.
The band members themselves seem to be having
good time. It is really difficult to understand w£
they are singing about, because their accents a
quite thick. Euros Childs, the lead vocalist, sounds
bit like an old country minstrel or jester. The rest
the band, including his sister Megan on strinj
clambers along with him.
The album “Introducing Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci”

song, “Miss Trudy,” is apparently about a viol

Calling all poets ...

Poet’s

That infamous rock in the quad ...
By Dave Ellet
For the Alestle
Editor’s Note: D ave Ellet is a guest colum nist who has
volunteered to be a guest columnist. His views in no way
reflect those o f the A lestle or its employees.

Since this is my first column, I feel I should start off by
saying that sooner or later (more sooner than later) I will
probably write something that will offend everyone. Feel
free to take what I have written personally and use your
constitutional rights to cry/moan/whine/etc. to anyone that
is not in a position to tell you that they could care less.
By now everyone has had a chance to walk by “the rock”
located in “the quad.” For those of you unaware of what
“the quad” is, it is the courtyard that is surrounded by
three buildings; thus the name “the quad.” This “rock” is a
lonely “rock” who just sits there, year by year, eroding.
Every once in a while, a m em ber of a
fraternity/sorority/juvenile detention home comes by and
attacks it with spray paint. Sure, the “rock” tries to move
but it is just not bright enough to outsmart the attacker
(well, most of the attackers; actually, about 50 percent of
the attackers).
These boulder terrorists belong to an elite group often
referred to by Greek letters. On Earth Day, the terrorists,
while spray painting the “rock,” talk about how they could
make the environment a better place. A t the same time
they are releasing the equivalent of 3.75 Tammy Faye
Baker Makeover Units of hair spray into the air.
One of the terrorist organizations, who I will only refer to
by their initials to protect their identity (SP), decided that
they would put a different spin on things and attack the
grass. Now don’t get me wrong, the “grass” is in no way as
helpless as the “rock.” The “grass” can quickly grow out of
the way of the attack. Therefore only the elite terrorists
(the upper 5 percent) are successful in attacking the
“grass.”
And there we were, smack in the middle of Rush week
(rush away from your books and come and play with us
week). I feel it is my civic duty to aid all the aspiring
Greeks/future leaders/juvenile delinquents/etc. in their
search for greatness.
First of all you must train. I suggest you begin
immediately. Run, don’t walk to the nearest hardware
store and purchase all the cans of spray paint that you can
afford, preferably the cans on the back of the shelf that
still have an unusually high, earth-friendly, lead content.
D on’t worry about spending all of your alcohol money;
you can always sniff the fumes. Next, begin spraying the
inanimate object of your choice in an enclosed,
unventilated room. Before you know it, you too will be
attempting to paint that damn elusive rock.

WARNING SIGNS.

Hits the ground and splashes,

Volleyball begins its season going 4-2
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
The SIUE volleyball team made
their presence known when they went
into the IUPU-Indianapolis Capitol
Classic over the Labor Day weekend
and took fourth out of 15 teams.
The first three games of the tour­
nament were the rough ones for the
Cougars.
Beginning with a win over Great
Lake Valley Conference foe Quincy,
the Cougars then lost two in a row
compliments of Saginaw Valley State
and conference champion Northern
Kentucky.

Both games went the distance and
could have gone either way but in the
end the Cougars fell just short.
“I’m very pleased because we
showed a lot of composure,”
Montgomery said. “We played a few
draining matches, but we handled
each situation well. This past weekend
can only build confidence.”
If anything was learned over this
weekend Montgomery said, it was the
players themselves learning what they
can do.
“I have a good idea what they are
capable of but they found out about
themselves this weekend. Volleyball is

a team sport and they also learned
how to play as a team,” Montgomery
said.
After starting 1-2 in the tourna­
ment the Cougars turned it around
and won the next three games.
Lake Superior State was first, then
conference foe Bellarmine and
Oakland rounded things out for the
Cougars.
Montgomery wants to stress that
this is just the first weekend. Even
though she is very happy with the per­
formance of the team, the schedule is
still long.
Sophomore Michelle Gillman

started the season off with a bang.
The No. 1 blocker in the GLVC last
season broke her single-match highs
in hitting percentage at .545 and solo
blocks with 13 and tied a single-match
mark in kills with 21.
SIUE hits the road for the
Missouri Southern State Tournament
this weekend. On Friday, the Cougars
take on the host Lady Lions at 2:30
p.m. and Drury at 7 p.m. On Saturday,
SIUE faces Truman State at 10 a.m.
and Henderson State at 3 p.m.
Missouri Southern State is currently
ranked 25th in the nation.

Women show their dominant offense
It only took two games for the SIUE
Women’s Soccer team to show how dominant
an offensive force they will be this season.
In their first contest of the year, the
Cougars blanked the University of MissouriRolla 4-0 Saturday evening.
Freshman back Kristi Stedman started the
scoring with the only goal of the first half.
The second half saw senior forward Stacy
Bundren add to the scoring with her first goal
of the season, and St. Louis’s Janece
Friederich dent the back of the goal twice.
Senior goalkeeper Stephanie Kult led
SIU E’s revamped defense to the shutout.
The Cougars were tested heavily by
Mercyhurst on Monday. SIUE had a three
goal lead spoiled before winning the game in
overtime.
Friederich scored 10 minutes into the game
to put the Cougars on the board from 25 yards
out.

Springfield, Illinois’ Megan Beagles con­
tributed three minutes later with a goal set up
by Friederich.
Friederich struck again in the 16th minute
with her fourth goal of the year from senior
Joan Wacker.
The ruthless assault by the Cougar offense
was met by a crowd silencing Mercyhurst
charge which lasted 36 minutes and gave the
visiting team three unanswered goals.
With the score knotted 3-3 and overtime
getting ready to begin, the Cougars knew that
they couldn’t let this one slip away.
Once again, Janece Friederich stepped up
to the challenge. At the 7 minute mark of
overtime, she scored the game winning goal
from 10 yards out to give SIUE the dramatic
4-3 victory.
The Cougars will play next against Great
Lakes Valley Conference foe Lewis on
September 14 in Romeoville, Illinois.
