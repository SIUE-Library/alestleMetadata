Parking problems persist
BY M IKE PER N IC K A
STAFF PHO TO GRA PH ER
The D epartm ent o f Art and
Design is plagued by parking
problem s, according to the chair,
but soft-sculpture parking Nazis
are not part o f the solution.
S IU E police rem o v ed a
scu lp ture from the A rt and
Design parking area last week at
the request o f Vice C hancellor
for A d m in istratio n
K enneth
Neher.
T he
h u m an-type
figure

som ew hat resem bled a scarecrow
and was affixed to a parking
meter pole. Its shoulders were
decorated with N azi SS em blem s
and a poem to the “Scare-parking
N azi” was w ritten on the stom ach
area.
Dr. Robin Brow n, chair of
the Art and D esign Departm ent,
published an apology letter. In
the letter, posted throughout the
A rt and D esign Building, Brown
noted that the “w ork o f art" was
“ ill-advised, poorly conceived,
and badly executed.”

He w ent on to say that the
sculpture could be view ed by
some as a “hate crim e.”
B ro w n a ls o s a id th a t “ art
is a p o w e r fu l c o m m u n ic a tiv e
to o l w ith th e a b ility to u p lif t
o r d e s tr o y . P le a s e u s e it
w is e ly .”
A postscript to the memo
noted,
h ow ever,
th at “the
departm ent has grow n tw ofold in
four years ... our current parking
allocation is still inadequate to
m eet our needs.”

Werner, vice chancellor won’t take
raises until others get salary increase

SIUE Chancellor David Werner (left) and
Vice Chancellor for Administration Ken
Neher.
BY DANIELLE BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
SIUE Chancellor David Werner and Vice
Chancellor for Administration Ken Neher have
decided to donate their raises to the university until
all SIUE staff and faculty receive equity
adjustments in January.
Werner and Neher each received a 3 percent
raise after equity adjustments were made for senior

adm inistrators at SIUE and SlU -C arbondale.
Werner and Neher initially refused to take the raise
because they reportedly felt uncomfortable taking
raises when the rest of the university staff and
faculty would have to wait until January for
increases. Wemer and Neher are both donating
their salary hikes to the University Foundation.
“The timing's not appropriate,” Neher said
Monday.
The disparity came about because Carbondale
em ployees’ raises were effective July 1. SIU
President Ted Sanders had ordered equity studies
and learned that some o f the 14 SIU senior
administrators were paid less than people at other
universities while some made more in similar jobs.
As a result, the SIU board o f trustees approved the
3 percent raise for senior administrators below the
average at Carbondale and at SIUE.
Wemer and Neher were the only two SIUE
senior administrators paid less than counterparts at
other universities.
"That's fine for the people at Carbondale
because everyone got them (the raise) effective
July 1," Neher said.
All faculty and unrepresented staff will
receive their equity adjustments on Jan. 1.

The note says the car broke down, but the driver got a ticket
anyway. Bad student/parking service agent relations may have
contributed to a controversial sculpture in the A rt and Design
parking lot that called the service agents ‘Parking Nazis. ’

Little plastic cups of lust Letters to the Editor
Sex is often a big issue for college students, and
especially freshm en — whether you’re actually having it or
not. It’s hard to hide from it. It stalks hallways, it lurks
around billboards and advertisem ents. It som etim es
follows you to class, and will show up while you’re
working out at the gym. But it is most often found lurking
Danielle
around those little plastic cups o f liquor at parties.
Belton
O h, those little plastic cups o f liquor. W hat
hedonistic temptations they are.
O f course, every year people tell me about how they are going to
start avoiding those little plastic cups. How they aren’t going to pay
any attention to sex when they find it stalking them in classroom s and
hallways. How they aren’t going to party so much this year. How they
are going to turn their lives around.
OK, yeah, right, whatever.
Some people started out their first year here saying that and ended
up having sex that same day. In this puritanical society, it just stalks
you. Sex is everywhere, and unless you move to a monastery, it’s
rather hard to avoid. A nd on a college campus those little plastic cups
are at every party waiting for you. At a Texas university, the school is
actually doing undercover sting operations by infiltrating G reek parties
and arresting people for serving alcohol to minors. But let’s not give
SIUE any ideas. L et’s assume that students here are capable of
controlling themselves. L et’s assume everyone is a responsible adult
who always practices safe sex and doesn’t allow little plastic cups to
ruin a life.
If only that were true.
I haven’t been to a party here on campus since last spring, and at
that time almost a year had elapsed since my last party. I’m not
knocking parties. I used to enjoy them, until all of them started to
resemble the one before. They were all the same. People w ould dance.
Greeks would step. O ne G reek would meet another from a different
fraternity and an argum ent or a fight would break out. Then some
greasy guy with bad breath and sweaty armpits w ould try to hit on you.
Oh. it was just awful.
Yet for a person not used to these parties, every bit o f this sweaty
scenario was im bued w ith sex. M ost of the girls wore their best — and
often shortest and tightest — outfits. People didn’t really dance, it was
more like a lot o f bum ping and grinding against each other. It was
always hot and musty, and those little plastic cups were always there
for the off-campus after-party party.
I
suggest that people w ho normally drink at parties not drink
they can watch how people act when they are intoxicated. It’s both
moronic and funny. The m en turn into lumbering, lusty beasts who will
fight for no apparent reason. The women become either hyper or slutty.
Some just fall asleep; those are my favorite types o f drunks.
Some wake up the next morning with hangovers, or next to people
they normally w ouldn’t give the time o f day to. T hat’s when they tell
me how last night w as the last night. They tell me how they are never
doing that again. Then, I see them at the next party, slum ped over the
toilet tossing up chunks, or trying to seduce someone equally as
intoxicated as them selves. I guess this is just part o f college.
College is tw o-thirds partying and one-third studying for some
people. For some, it’s the opportunity to have as much liquor and sex
as possible before society forces them to grow up and becom e an adult.
After all, some people act like they can’t say no to the lure o f sex that
stalks them. Hopefully for that group, there is plenty o f birth control,
therapy and free clinics.
For everyone who said this weekend was the last, you d o n ’t have
to give up everything. You ju st have to give up doing it until you're
sloppy drunk and stop increasing your chances o f becom ing
som eone’s parent. A fter all, it’s hard to graduate in five years with your
head in the toilet and your privates outside o f your pants.

Equity adjustments for all
I w ould like to share my
thoughts w ith th e p u b lic and
students
reg ard in g
som e
im portant issu es co n cern in g
SIUE.
T here will be m ore green
on SIU E
cam p u s
as the
negotiations for a new clerical
contract continues. W orkers are
enco u rag ed to w ear g reen Tshirts, g reen rib b o n s, "This
U niversity W orks B ecause We
Do" buttons or anything else that
indicates th a t w e are proud
union em ployees and dedicated,
worthwhile civil service workers.
The wearing o f the green and
buttons is to ex p ress to the
ad m in istratio n that w e are
dedicated w orkers and deserve a
2 p ercent eq u ity
raise.
I
encourage all to w ear green so
the adm inistration know s we are
united on this issue.
T he
C lerical/K in d red
w orkers o f S IU E h av e been
perform ing their duties since July
1, 1998, w ith o u t a signed
contract and w ithout receiving
the 3 percent cost o f living raise
that the g o v ern o r signed into
effect the first o f July. T here are
issues being n eg o tiated other
sothan salaries; ev ery issue is
important, but a 2 percent equity
raise is need ed by the civil

service em ployees!
A 2 percent equity raise has
been given to the adm inistration.
It w as reported in the Saturday,
Sept. 12, and the Sunday, Sept.
13, issue o f the "Edw ardsville
In tellig en cer" th at P resid en t
Sanders received a 3 percent cost
o f living increase o f $5,088 and
an equity adjustm ent o f $5,998.
C h an cello r W erner receiv ed a
salary increase o f $3,720 for a 3
percent cost o f living raise and
$7,972 as his equity adjustm ent.
These raises are part o f a twoyear equity adjustm ent plan as
stated by President Sanders in the
article.
It is reported that faculty also
received the 2 p ercen t equity
raise. Then w hy shouldn't the
clerical em ployees deserve the 2
percent equity adjustm ent? If a
tw o-year plan is im plem ented for
the adm inistration, w hy aren't the
funds available for the clerical 2
percent equity adjustm ents to be
granted this year also? O r are
funds
b u d g eted
o nly
for
adm inistrators’ salaries?
An equity raise is to bring an
em ployee's salary m ore in line
w ith
em p lo y ees
of
other
universities. If the adm inistrators
o f SIU E are m ore in line salarywise, don't the w orkers o f the
cam pus also deserve the same
type of equity? T he president's

and ch an cello r's salaries were
co m p ared ag ain st u n iv ersities
across the U nited States from
east to west, according to the
“Intelligencer.” T he cost o f living
in other areas may be higher than
here in the M idw est, so I w ould
expect those salaries to be higher.
If the a d m in istra to rs’ salaries
w ere
adjusted
from
those
com parisons, the clerical w orkers
and everyone else should have
the
sam e
co m p ariso n
and
standards set forth.
H ow m any realize that the
S IU E clerica l civ il service
em ployees are the low est paid
university em ployees in the state
o f Illinois? A re the public or
students, or ev en the faculty
proud o f that fact? T he equity
ad ju stm en t w as a n eg o tiatin g
issue d u rin g the last co n tract
negotiation, and now this year the
issue is still being discussed. I
b eliev e
the
civil
serv ice
em ployees deserve this 2 percent
equity raise.
H opefully,
th e
n ex t
negotiating m eeting, scheduled
for 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, Sept.
24,
1998,
w ill
end
the
neg o tiatio n s
reg a rd in g
the
clerical w ages, and include an
equity adjustment.

plastic D racula teeth has never
really scared me. M aybe if the
haunted houses w ere staffed with
M arilyn M anson look-alikes, it
w ould be a different story.
G iven m y feelings tow ard
these fraudulent houses o f horror,
you can understand m y dism ay
when I had to go to D arkness
H aunted T hem e P ark fo r the
Alestle. But, to my surprise the
place w a s ... w ell ... a little scary.
On the car ride over, a radio
D J announced that th e place was
voted the best haunted house in
St. Louis for the past five years. I
w as sk eptical. H ow ever, my
skepticism faded as soon as I

w alked up the b u ild in g ’s
rickety w ooden steps.
O nce inside the spacious
w aiting area, I u n d ersto o d
why they call it a “them e
park.” U nlike other haunted
houses w here the people are
herded into long , slow
moving lines, T he D arkness
H aunted Them e Park replaces
the
w aiting
lin es
w ith
activities. It has a 13-hole
m in i-g o lf co u rse, a h o rro r
photo
booth,
a
th eater
show ing horror-related clips
and a snack bar w ith p len ty of
tables. The jew el o f the pre­
fright festivities is a horror
and science fiction m useum .
S tocked
w ith
m ovie
m em orabilia,
alien s,
the
P redator and o th e r eyepleasing k n ic k k n ac k s, the
m useum took the angst out o f
waiting.
E ventually, o u r group

Located in
istorie Soulard

was allow ed to enter the
first in a series of rooms.
A lthough I d o n ’t w ant to
give aw ay too m any
details, I will say that they
break your group into sets
o f fo u r people. The
haunted house itself is an
elab o rate lab y rin th of
rooms, dark halls, bridges
and p assag ew ay s. My
small group encountered
an ab an d o n ed subw ay
station, G otham City, an
“Escape from New York”
set-up, a ju n g le, plus the
usual horror displays.
The sheer duration of
this haunted journey was
im pressive. I seem ed to
lose my concept of time
w hile in th e haunted
house, b u t I ’d estim ate
that it to o k about 30
m inutes to get through the
whole thing.

So, w as it scary? Well, I
guess it depends on you. If you
scare easily, th en y o u ’ll be
scream ing the entire tim e. I was
visibly sta rtled a few tim es,
w hich is m uch m ore than any
oth er
h au n ted
h o u se
has
accom plished. I think I’d be more
frightened if the staff used lead
pipes to beat the hell out o f the
people w alking in front o f me —
instead o f ju st ju m ping out of
walls. B ut I ’ve been told that that
would be illegal.
The
D ark n ess
H aunted
Them e Park gets m y enthusiastic
recom m endation. It is open from
6 p.m. to 1 a.m. Fridays and
S aturdays in S eptem ber. It is
located in the old W elsh baby
carriage facto ry rig h t b ehind
Soulard M arket. Tickets can be
purchased in a booth outside the
park for $13. A lthough that can
be a large chunk o f change for
college students, this place is well
worth it.

Elvira - “Hanging out” didn’t make her famous
BY JIM DALTON
L IFE ST Y L E STRINGER
Elvira, M istress o f the Dark, knew that after years o f
struggle she had finally arrived in the world o f show biz.
“W hen I got my ow n pinball m achine, I knew I finally
m ade it,” E lvira’s pretty alter ego, C assandra Peterson said.
Elvira, the popular hostess who has introduced hundreds
of B horror m ovies to late-night television fans, w as in tow n
to prom ote the D arkness H aunted Them e Park. (See the
accom panying story.)
I had expected a phony response typical o f som e
celebrities, but her candid response took m e by surprise. I
surely did n ’t think she w ould be a funny, yet seriously
captivating w om an w ith obvious talent. However, as usual, I
was wrong.
C assandra P eterson, like many successful people, has a
kind o f resilient toughness to her. It is a quality that can
protect one from all the bum ps and scrapes that accum ulate as
one chases dream s. Shielded by this im penetrable layer,
Peterson began h e r career in Las Vegas w here, at the age o f
17, she becam e the youngest show girl in history.
A short tim e later, her am bitions turned from dancing to
singing. E ncouraged b y none other than Elvis, w ho saw her
perform one night, she pursued a career in m usic. E ventually,
she becam e the lead singer o f an Italian rock band w hich took
her to Europe. B ut, singing w as not h er true calling an d in the
late ‘70s, she cam e back to the U nited States to jo in the
im provisational com edy group, The G roundlings.
“This is so intense. If you can do that type o f com edy,
you can do anything. T he techniques transfer over to alm ost
an y th in g ,” P ete rso n said w ith a d efin ite lo o k o f
accom plishm ent as she reflected on the early days.
D espite appearances on television and the big screen, real
fam e still alluded Peterson.
“I spent years struggling to pay m y rent each m onth,” she

said. However, in late 1981, she got the jo b as Elvira. The
tim ing even suggested an elem ent of fate. “ I had told m yself
that if I d idn’t m ake it by m y 30th birthday, I’d quit. Two
w eeks before I turned 30, I got Elvira,” said Peterson, who
still appears to be around 30.
Since then, she h as m ade hundreds o f telev isio n
appearances, starred in feature films and created her own
E lvira em pire, w hich includes action figures, lamps, com ic
books, videos and m erchandise. Her E lvira character has
becom e a part o f A m erican pop culture. Elvira uniquely
com bines horror with sex appeal. To learn more about this
M istress o f the D ark, ch eck out her w eb site at
w w w .elvira.com .
H ere are Peterson’s thoughts on a few topics:
W hat do you think o f tod ay’s current trend in horror
film s? Do you enjoy m ovies like “Scream ” ?
I hated “Scream .” It w as so boring and old. I kept
w aiting for it to get funny, b ut it never did. I d o n ’t like those
slasher m ovies w here a guy chases a girl w ith a knife. I ’d
rather see a m ovie that deals w ith situations outside o f our
everyday life. A lthough it’s m ore sci-fi than horror, I enjoyed
the new “A lien” film, also, psychological thrillers such as
“Peeping Tom” or “P sy ch o .” Your im agination can always
be m ore frightening than anything they can show you on the
screen.
Could the Elvira ch aracter be recreated today?
Probably not. It w as a really good tim e for me. It w ould
definitely be harder to recreate E lvira because syndication
doesn’t really happen as m uch. A lot o f T V stations d o n ’t
have that m uch money, so only a big (netw ork) like CBS
could pull it off.
W hat advice do you have for som eone trying to
follow in your footsteps and get into acting?
M ake sure your goal is acting and not becom ing rich
and fam ous. Be prepared to be broke. Big payoffs are few

Elvira, the Mistress o f the Dark
and far between. Only about 5 percent o f the
Screen A ctors Guild m ake a living through
acting, so y o u ’ll have to have a night job
that will allow you to go to auditions.
I was trying for 12 years before things
started happening. ... E very single day I
w ould do one thing to further m y career.
W hether it w as a phone call, audition or
interview, I always did at least one thing.
You ca n ’t ju st hang out in H ollyw ood and
get famous.
