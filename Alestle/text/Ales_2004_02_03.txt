Spring brings more students to campus
B ru ce K lo sterm a nn
N ew s R epo r ter

S IU E ’s spring en ro llm en t
figures are in and the u niversity’s
grow th trend continues.
A ccording to the O ffice of
A dm issions, enrollm ent for the
spring 2004 se m ester is at
12,597, a 3.6 percent increase
o v er spring 2 0 0 3 ’s fig u re o f
12,161.
E nrollm ent has increased by
nearly 1,000 students since the
spring 2002 semester.
This sem ester’s figures show
the continuation o f a nine-year
grow th trend at SIU E Fall 2003

enrollm ent was at 13,295, a 4.5
percent increase over Fall 2002.
A ssistant Vice C h an cello r
for E nrollm ent M anagem ent
Boyd Bradshaw said he expected
the enrollm ent growth.
“ W e’ve
seen
co n sisten t
increases in our fall enrollm ent,”
Bradshaw said. “Now w hat w e’re
starting to see is a spring growth
pattern that m irrors the fall
increases.”
Illinois state bud g et cuts
have put a crunch on S IU E ’s
funding in recent y ears, but
university officials h av e used
increasing tuition rev en u e to
offset the money crunch.

T h e en ro llm en t boom has
raised concerns am ong students
about increasing class sizes and
lack o f course offerings. SIUE
C h a n cello r
D avid
W erner
addressed those concerns in his
speech at the January C offee with
the Chancellor.
W erner said the university is
studying the class schedules and
room availability, along w ith the
p o ssib ility o f o ffe rin g m ore
Friday classes.
"T h e classro o m space is
there,” W erner said.
T he chancellor said finding
faculty av ailab le to teach the
classes might be the difficult part.

Correction
In the Jan. 29 issue of the Alestle, the story “Virus puts email under the weather” gave the incorrect phone number for
the Office of Information Technology Support Center. The
correct number is 650-3739. The Alestle regrets the error.

Letter to the Editor

Alumnus questions penny pinching
D ear Editor,
This is to show the outside
perception o f the current labor
n egotiations
b etw een
the
university and the A m erican
Federation o f State, County and
M unicipal Em ployees.
The argum ent seem s to be
about a .5 percent. T he union has
asked for a 1.5 percent raise and
you have offered 1 percent.
Figuring 67 em ployees and
an average pay o f $10 an hour for
the janitors, that com es to the
follow ing: at 40 hours per week
on 52 w eeks, (and the custodians,
only w ork 37.5) that com es to
$208 per em ployee per year. If
you m ultiply that by 67, you get
$13,936.
T he nonunio n em p lo y ees
received a 2 percent raise so I
m ust assum e th e ir w ages are
lower.

H ow ever, if they are not
low er then it appears this is an
attem pt to bust the union, w hich
I, as an alum nus, w ould find
disgusting.
Furtherm ore, the union has
asked only for 1.5 percent. That
is a difference o f $6,968. It w ould
be ludicrous for a university to
d am ag e its rep u ta tio n over
$7,000 a year.
I have spoken to the head o f
the Alum ni A ssociation because I
heard alum ni w anted the school
to do this.
T he d irector/president told
m e the asso ciatio n w as not
involved directly or indirectly
and had a shocked look on his
face w hen I told him.
The alum ni are on neither
side, but if this persists, others
and I will be pushing for a move
on behalf o f the janitors.
R ealizing university officials

cannot confirm or deny w hat is
being said, all I am doing is
letting you know the o utside
perception.
W hoever called the police on
the custodians at graduation Dec.
20 m ade a grave error.
The next day on Sunday I
spoke with a few people who
w itnessed w hat happened, none
o f w hich w ere custodians or in a
union, and they felt it w as sim ply
a show o f force.
A
show
of
fo rce
is
co m m en d ab le
in
certain
situations. H ow ever, in this case
it seems to show the university’s
intent to break the union.
If this is about the other
contracts com ing up, m aybe the
university feels the custodians are
the easiest to push around
because officials have the least
personal contact w ith them.
If the university can bully

them into taking a sm all am ount,
it will m ake it easier into doing
the sam e w ith the clerical.
A fter all, you w ould w ant the
people w ho are tak in g your
m essages and creating your work
environm ent to be happy with
you.
Since that is the only logical
conclusion, I ran the follow ing
numbers.
If the av erag e clerical
w orker costs $20 per hour, w hich
1 know is less but through fuzzy
math you will get it to $20, and
you have 300 em p lo y ees, the
total cost is $249,600.
T hat is not even up to a fair
cost o f living allow ance.
T hat is about the sam e as the
tax credit C ongress passed last
year per worker.

Two groups o f SIU E students will
travel to C osta R ica in M ay and July to
p articip a te in a d iv e rse study abroad
program .
T he program allow s students o f all
d ep a rtm en ts
to
learn
in
a
new
environm ent.
T he study abroad program to C osta
Rica has been conducted since May of
2001. Since then, nine groups o f students
have participated in the program .
E con o m ics and fin an c e professor
Laura W olff is the coordinator for the
project.
“T he purpose is to form a relationship
betw een SIU E and C arara N ational Park
that will allow our students various kinds
o f learning opportunities,” W olff said.
W hile in C osta R ica, students will
stay on the grounds o f C arara N ational
Park, a rain forest w ildlife refuge that is
noted for its scarlet m acaw population.
W hile at C arara, students will help
m aintain the park by w orking on park
b u ild in g s and trails and installing
inform ation-gathering w eather stations.
C arara has a lush variety o f flora and
fauna for students to observe. Som e o f the
anim al species found in C arara include the
A m erican crocodile, great anteater, ocelot,
C entral A m erican spider monkey, great
curassow and the black and green poison

will not be a luxurious one.
“We w ill b asically be c a m p in g ,”
W olff said. “W e’re roughing it. It is C osta
Rica. It’s the rain forest.”
Since July in C osta Rica is turtle
season, students will also w ork at a turtle
sanctuary in Playa H erm osa.
T he sa n ctu ary is d ed icated to
protecting the dim inishing population of
olive ridley sea turtles that inhabit the
C osta Rican waters.
Students will w ork with the sanctuary
staff to m onitor the turtle noniilation as

w ell as to protect the turtles’ eggs from
poachers.
T he program is open to students in all
areas o f study and is an interdisciplinary
p ro g ram . Som e stu d ents w ho have
attended the trip before have been in
geography, business, biology, econom ics,
co m p u te r scien ce and en v iro n m en tal
education.
T he program is designed to be a
valuable learning experience. Before the
trip, students attend six to eight classes
that prepare them for the program .
W hile in C o sta R ica, they attend
nrp<;pntations at Carara to learn about the

v ario u s facets o f C o sta R ica and its
environm ent, econom y and w ildlife.
Students also visit local schools to
teach the C osta R ican ch ild ren . Each
student is also responsible fo r producing a
project about w hat they learned while
p articip atin g

program.

Art exhibit equals hard work
V ic k i K r u s e
L if e s t y l e s S t r in g e r

The SIUE U ndergraduate Student Art
Exhibition cultivates an environm ent of
community.
Students work long hours to prepare
for the exhibition, scheduled to open with
a reception at 4 p.m. today in the New
Wagner Gallery.
“I like having a united com m unity of
peers w hen en terin g the ex h ib itio n ,”
ceram ics senior Susanne H arm on said.
Harm on said she plans to enter three
ceram ic pieces and two sculptures in the
exhibition.
“In ceram ics, I like to stay w ith sim ple
forms, sets o f things that sit on a base,”
Harmon said.
H arm on began college as a m ath
m ajor and w as encouraged by an art
history professor to take a ceram ics class.
“It fits my personality and how I was
raised,” H arm on said. “I was raised on a
farm and w orked w ith my hands a lot.”
A rt
p ro fesso r John
D enhouter
contacted Art St. L ouis E xecutive D irector
Dion Dion to serve as the ju ro r for the
exhibition. A rt St. Louis is a nonprofit co­
op art gallery.
Dion will judge the artw ork Friday for
two or three hours, D enhouter said.
“This is a chance for students to get an
idea of seeing w hat is ensconced in the art
com m unity for w hen they graduate and
enter exhibitions,” D enhouter said.
P ro fesso r T had D uhigg, head o f
sculpture in the A rt D epartm ent, said the
exhibition is a great opportunity to enter
and put on a resum e.
“And this is a freebie,” D uhigg added.
A rt students occupy the A rt Building
as many hours as needed to get their work
done.
Sculpture senior Crystal K w entus said
she plans to spend 40 to 50 hours a week
w orking in the studio this sem ester on her
thesis show.

the undergraduates need an opportunity to
exhibit their work.
“A big part o f being an artist is taking
a chance in a safe environm ent in juried
show s,” Strand said. “There is a way of
m ediating it w ith som eone to rem ind you
that it’s one person’s opinion.”
Textiles and w eaving senior D eanne
M oore said the them e in her w ork involves
insects.
M oore is w orking on her thesis show
and plans to w eave silk fabric and w eave
actual silkworm pods into it, incorporating
the them e o f insects.

John Burnside, one o f G reat B ritain’s
m ost acclaim ed w riters, read from a
selection o f his w orks at B. B arnard Birger
Hall Tuesday, Jan. 27.
An asso rtm en t o f stud en ts and
teachers w ere present to listen.
Burnside won the W hitbread Poetry
Prize in 2000.
“ B u rn sid e’s poem s have the rare
pow er to alter o n e’s perception o f the
world and o f language ... a sensory delight
with an epiphany on every page,” the
judges said about aw arding Burnside the
prize.
Burnside is an accom plished author
and a teacher at the U niversity o f St.
A ndrew s, w hich is the oldest university in
Scotland.
B urnside’s first book w as a book of
poetry released in 1988. H e has since
w ritten four novels and seven other poetry
books, along with a collection o f short
stories.
Burnside said he becam e a w riter so

he could “say the things I really w ant to
say, in my ow n way.”
T he
first
novel
Burnside w rote w as “The
Dumb H ouse,” based on a
psychopathic m an w ho did

two children in a basem ent
to see how they w ould turn
out.
B urnside
has
dark
characters in so m e o f his
books. He said he believes everyone has a
dark side and that is his inspiration for his
dark characters.
“You have to dig dow n into yourself
and find your dark side,” Burnside said.
“There is darkness in all o f us.”
The second novel Burnside w rote is
titled “B urning E lvis,” and this book is
about four men at the bottom o f the social
scale and w hat happens to them.
B urnside’s third novel, “T he Locust
R oom ,” is based in the U niversity o f
C am bridge during the 1970s. T here was a
rapist on cam pus, and the book is about

som etim es “really im portant to hurt your
reader, m ake them feel uncom fortable.”
T he book is about the responsibility
o f m en to behave p ro p erly to w ard
w om en.
B urnside’s m ost recent book, “ Living
N ow here,” is about B urnside’s hom etow n,
although it is not autobiographical.
T he book is about friendship and love,
and the m ain characters are tw o very close
friends.
Som e o f the poetry Burnside w rites
is about very usual day-to-day topics,
such as his m arriage, his 3-year-old son

and the way hum ans relate to the natural
world.
B urnside said he b eliev es w riting
“should surprise the w riter as m uch as the
reader.”
“ I th in k th at the read in g s w ere
touching because they were about things
that I could relate to,” senior C handra
W ilder said. “Burnside describes things in
depth with a touch o f humor. I enjoyed
m yself.”
M ost o f w hat Burnside read Tuesday

Perseverance pays off for the Cougars
Cougars end two-game skid with win over Quincy
K evin C o rrig a n
Sports Editor

K w a m e R o s s /A l e s t l e

Junior center Dan Heimos looks to take a Quincy defender to the
hole. Heimos and the Cougars stand in fifth place in the Great
Lakes Valley Conference, with a 6-7 conference record.

Com ing o ff tw o road losses,
the Cougars needed to get off to a
quick start against the Q uincy
U niversity Hawks.
Jolted by an 18-0 run to start
the gam e, the Cougars dropped
Q uincy 60-51 T hursday to get
back in the thick o f the G reat
Lakes Valley C onference mix.
“It was a great lift to open
the gam e the w ay w e did,
especially the w ay w e finished
the gam e,” head coach M arty
Sim m ons said. “If we d o n ’t get
that start, w e probably w alk out
of the gam e as losers.”
T he C ougars im proved to
10-9 overall
and 6-7 in
conference play. W ith the loss,
the H aw ks fell to 8-12 and 4-8 in
conference play.
S en io r guard R on Jones
again led the w ay fo r the
Cougars, dropping in 17 points.
Junior guards T yler H ackstadt
and C alvin Sykes each added 12
points for the Cougars.
The Cougars held the Hawks
sco reless fo r the first nine
m inutes o f the first half. Q uincy
d id n ’t register a field goal until

there w as 6 m inutes, 43 seconds
rem aining in the first half.
“T h at’s im pressive to look
back on,” Sim m ons said. “It’s
nice to get the crow d behind you
when you go on a run like that.
O ur players really w ere driven by
the crow d’s enthusiasm .”
W ith 3 m inutes, 43 seconds
to go in the first half, the Cougars
stretched the lead to 30-4 on a
12-foot ju m p er by Jones. From
there, the Cougars coasted into
the h alf with a 35-13 lead.
T he Cougars w ere able to
contain Q uincy big m an Cory
C um m ens, holding him to ju st
four points.
“ A ndre T hom as and Tyler
H ackstdt drew the assignm ent of
m arking C um m ens,” Sim m ons
said. “We got a great team effort
from everyone on the defensive
side o f the b all, th o u g h . He
(Cum m ens) has had som e bigscoring perform ances lately.”
C um m ens had topped the
3 0 -p o in t plateau in his tw o
previous gam es
T he H aw ks did get a quality
effo rt
from
g u ard
Jam al
Thom pson, w hose 20 points was
a gam e high.
W hile the C ougars cam e out

v icto rio u s, S im m o n s said he
know s the team ’s second h alf
w oes are not acceptable at this
level.
“We did this last w eek at
N orthern
K entucky
(U n iv ersity ),” S im m o n s said.
“We have
to
have
m ore
com posure dow n the stretch and
take care o f the basketball.”
T he victory solidified the
C o u g ar’s presence in the GLVC
standings, putting them in fifth
place with seven gam es to go.
As
S im m o n s
and
the
Cougars know, from here on out,
they ju st get m ore im portant.
“W e’re at that stage o f the
seaso n w here every team is
fighting for positioning. Every
team is now fam iliar w ith one
another, and we are going to have
to play our brand o f basketball to
be successful,” Sim m ons said.

Senior cross country runner
Breanne Steffens w as honored as
the GLVC S cholar A thlete in
w om en’s cross country. Steffens
is a psychology m ajor w ith a
m inor in sociology and has a
3.537 overall grade point average
and held a 3.75 in the fall.
Steffens is the first C ougar to
earn A ll-A m erican h o n o rs in
cross country. She w as ranked
26th nationally last season. She
holds the SIU E record in the

6,000-m eter and 5,000-m eter run
and was part o f the four-w om en,
800-m eter record-setting team in
2002. Steffens was also nam ed an
A ll-A m erican Scholar in 2002
and 2003.
H ead coach D arryl Frerker
said Steffens is a valuable asset to
his team.
“She is a team le ad er,”
F rerker said. “She is w hat I
w ould call an appropriate team
leader. Som etim es she steps back
and lets things happen, and
som etim es she steps up and
voices her opinion.”
Frerker said having som eone
as ded icated to school and
athletics in the program provides
a strong positive influence on the
younger runners.
“T hat’s alw ays been one of
the benefits o f having an athlete
like this in the program ,” Frerker
said.
“You could get som eone that
goes out and is not a very good
leader, then those are they types

o f ath letes that w o u ld get
developed. She has the quality to
provide all o f the positive aspects
in the program w h ile she
continues to develop herself.”
A ccording to Frerker, good
g rades
have
alw ay s
been
im portant to him.
“ I stress grades. I alw ays
have,” Frerker said. “Education
is im portant anyw here obviously.
In this institution, having good
grades has alw ays been a top
priority. The (N ational C ollegiate
A thletic
A sso c iatio n )
has
standards, and if you d o n ’t m eet
those stan d ard s and
SIU E
standards, then you are ineligible
to com pete.”
Frerker said Steffens is ju st
one o f a num ber o f strong leaders
on the cross country team s and
the indoor and outdoor track and
field teams.
“ I’ve had a good team and
I’ve had good individuals, but

The
Q u in cy
U niversity
Hawks have been on top o f the
G reat Lakes Valley C onference
all season. T hursday night the
Cougars found out why.
P aced by fiv e d ifferen t
players in double figures, the
H aw ks rolled past the Cougars,
78-58.
“They are a very im pressive
team, as we found out,” head
coach W endy H edberg said.
“Q uincy
is
lo ad ed
w ith
upperclassm en, and they really
feel like this is their year.”
The Cougars dropped to 911 overall and 4-9 in conference
play. W ith the victory, the Hawks
im proved to 16-3 and 10-2 in the
GLVC.
D espite the final score, the
Cougars w ere able to hang with
the H aw ks in the first half. For
m uch o f the half, the score was
nip and tuck w ith SIU E tying the
gam e at 29 -2 9 w ith only 2
m inutes,49 seconds to play. The
H aw ks,
h o w ev er,
n ever

relinquished the lead and clung
to a 35-30 score going into the
break.
“We played right with them
in that first half,” H edberg said.
“We gave them som e open looks
and they knocked dow n the big
shots. I feel that the effort and
intensity was there, but give them
credit; they cam e up w ith the
clutch shot every tim e.”
The H aw ks used a 20-2 run
to start the h alf to push the lead
up to 25. From there, the H aw ks
never looked back, coasting to
the 20-point victory.
“T heir press in the second
h a lf ju s t o v erw h elm ed u s,”
H edberg said. “We tried to call a
couple tim eouts and regroup, but
they ju s t ap p lied too m uch
pressure.”
Senior guard Jessica Robert
once again led the C ougars in
scoring, pouring in 15 points.
S enior guard S arah S chw eers
pitched in 13 points for SIUE.
A ccording to H edberg, the
Cougars need to see m ore o f a
physical presence dow n in the
post.
“We really d id n ’t get any

offense from our post players,”
H edberg
said.
“(S o p h o m o re
center) Tonya (G uell) was held
scoreless in the first h alf and
didn’t put up m uch in the second
half either. We need to find some
form o f consistency dow n there.”
Q u in c y ’s b alan c ed attack
included 32 points from a deep
bench, and the H aw ks were able
to out rebound the C ougars 37-24
as w ell. S en io r guard Tiffany
K elv er d id a little b it o f
ev ery th in g fo r the H aw ks,
dropping in 10 points, five assists
and grabbing seven rebounds.
“T h eir b en ch really gave
them a lift,” H edberg said. “It’s a
great asset to be able to count on
m ultiple players to step up game
in and gam e out.”
Q uincy’s bench also did a
great jo b o f keeping possession.
The C ougars w ill have to
regroup quickly w ith two m ore

He will also speak on the state of higher education in American society, which will
be one of the main focal points of his speech. Mr. Seale will address these topics
in the hopes of educating those in attendance about the importance of the BPP
