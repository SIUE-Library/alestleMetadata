Som e m em bers o f student
governm ent are having second
th o u g h ts about the m e al plan
proposal that w as unanim ously
approved at the F riday student
governm ent meeting.
“In hindsight w e should have
tab led the prop o sal,” S en ato r
M elissa G lauber said. “People
m ight not realize the loopholes at
first glance.”
T he
loopholes
G lau b e r
referred to are in proposed m eal
plans B and C for residence hall
stu d en ts in fiscal y e a r 2004,
w hich begins July 1, 2003.
M eal plans B and C w ould
in crease
$255
and
$524
respectively.
The plans w ould be referred
to as the light plan, at $1,142 per
semester, and the hearty plan, at
$1,580.
Students on involuntary m eal
plans will only be able to use 40
percent o f the m oney they spend
on a m eal plan.
T h e rest w ill co v e r F ood
S erv ice’s overh ead costs. B ut

students on the involuntary plans
w ould receive a 60 p ercen t
disco u n t
on
fo o d
item s
everyw here on cam pus except the
C om m ons G rill and U nion
Station.
“Sixty percent o f the m eal
plan am ount w ould go tow ard
Food S erv ice’s d irec t costs,
including la b o r an d b u sin ess
expenses,” U niversity H ousing
D irector M ichael S chultz said.
“Students w ould then have the
rem aining 40 percent, $457 on
the light plan and $632 on the
hearty plan, to spend on food.”
Students can add m oney to
either o f the plans and m ay not be
charged the 60 percent overhead
costs.
M orris U niversity C e n ter
B usiness
M a n ag e r
Jim
M cD erm ott said no decision has
been m ade on if the university
w ill take 60 percent from w hat
students add to their m eal plans.
S tudents w ill b e refunded
u nsp en t m oney on th eir m eal
plans at the end o f each semester.
G lauber questioned the need
for the hearty plan.

As a man who’s devoted his life to the pursuit of knowledge, Dean Hashimoto wasn't going to
pick a retirement plan without first doing his homework That’s why he chose an IRA from us,
the people with over 8 0 years’ experience managing portfolios for the world's sharpest minds.
After discovering that our IRAs offer a variety of investment choices and low expenses,
he decided to add one to his resume. A wise choice, by a very wise man.

Bush welfare plan not on target

N ew s e d it o r :
D

P age

President Bush is planning
to expand on the changes m ade in
the 1996 W elfare R eform Bill
passed by President C linton.
A ccording to a Feb. 26
W ashington, D .C ., article “B ush
E yes W elfare O verh au l,” the
W hite H ouse gushed that the
1996 law w as “one o f the greatest
p ublic policy su ccesses in
decades.”
Since the 1996 refo rm ,
around 6 m illion people have left
the w elfare rolls. A lthough the
bill conveniently failed to add a
provision to discover the fate o f
fo rm er recip ien ts, th ere are
plenty o f indicatio n s th at the
reform had negative side effects.
Bush m ight do w ell to exam ine
reports
from
o v erw h elm ed
h om eless sh elters and food
pantries throughout the country
th a t have seen a d ram atic

in crease
in
req u e sts
fo r
em ergency assistance.
T hose alarm ed at the plan to
expand w elfare refo rm have
legitim ate reason fo r concern.
H ealth an d H u m an S erv ices
S ecretary Tom m y T h o m p so n
gave am p le in d ic atio n o f the
nature such reform s w ould take
w hen he w as g o v ern o r o f
W isconsin.
W isconsin w as loudly touted
as a w elfare reform success story
because its w elfare rolls w ere
red u ced by 67 p erc en t sin ce
1986, according to F rances Fox
P iv en ’s article in T h e N atio n
m ag azin e in F eb ru ary 2001.
However, Piven observed, “T he
earnings o f the 62 percent o f
w elfare leav ers o r cu rren t
recipients w ho w orked averaged
only $8,560 a year, substantially
below the poverty line.”
I have lived on this am ount
o f m oney and can say that 1
co u ld n ’t do it w ith o u t g oing
progressively deeper into debt.
However, one d o esn ’t need to be
a single parent on this m iniscule
incom e to do the m ath. U n d er the
circum stances, it hardly seem s
odd th at m any ad v o cacy and
hum an rights groups fail to share
the ex u b eran t o p tim ism ab o u t
this supposed “success.”

A cco rd in g to the article,
Bush also is asking C ongress to
set asid e $300 m illio n fo r
program s aim ed at p ressu rin g
single m others on w elfare into
m arriag e. S ettin g asid e the
assum ption that all poor, single
m others are driven by greed and
imm orality, w e m ight consider
that these m others m ay have a
reason for being single.
N u m ero u s stu d ies show
conn ectio n s betw een d o m estic
vio len ce an d poverty, w ith
estim ates
th a t
n atio n w id e
anyw here from a third to a h alf o f
the w om en receiv in g w elfare
benefits are victim s o f dom estic
violence.
N ot only do h igher rates o f
d o m estic
v io len ce
am ong
w elfare recip ien ts ex p lain a
desire to avoid m arriage, but it
co n trad icts
the
u n d erly in g
assu m p tio n th a t a m a rriag e
licen se
w ill
m a g ica lly
fix
p roblem s.
O b v io u sly
the
problem s o f im poverished, single
mothers will increase if they are
pushed to m arry their batterers in
order to keep th e ir w elfare
b en efits. A nd, in a fu rth e r
ex am p le o f “c o m p assio n ate
co n serv atism ,”
h o m o se x u als
already in healthy relationships
a re n ’t allow ed to m arry th eir

partners.
B ush says: L et th em eat
w edding cake! However, the poor
m others in th is co u n try need
housing, child care and health
care they can afford. T hey need
to stop b ein g used as ta rg et
practice by politicians engaged in
the popular practice o f bashing
the poor. Since the voices o f the
poor have disappeared fro m the
national d isco u rse, th is is a
particularly cheap shot.
U n fo rtu n ately ,
B u sh ’s
w elfare refo rm p ac k ag e d o es
nothing to address the system ic
causes o f poverty. T he plan does
not look at the lack o f affordable
h ealth
care,
h o u sin g ,
transportation o r child care. It
does n o th in g to lo w er ch ild
m o rtality rates by in c re a sin g
access to prenatal care. It does
nothing to address the extrem ely
serious
issu e
o f d o m e stic
violence, nor does it prom ote the
idea that com panies should pay
w orkers a w age they can actually
live on.
It

W e're seeking graduating and experienced
teachers to lead our six million students into the future. And we're hiring in all areas
of the state, for many types of teaching positions.
California has a uniquely diverse population, and w e're looking for teachers who
embrace these differences and use them to enhance the learning environment.
Because the Classroom Reduction Act of 1996 reduced class sizes to 20 students
per teacher in grades K-3, we have a renewed need for teachers in those grades
We also have a great need for teachers who specialize in math, science,
ESIVbilingual education and special education at all grade levels.

Bring your teaching degree to California
Our commitment to education translates into real benefits for teachers: Starting
salaries of $34,000 to $44,000 for first year teachers; up to $19,000 in grants for
education loans; no-money-down mortgages with low interest rates; and other
incentives for teachers in areas of high need.

Colon cancer is an equal opportu­

begins without symptoms and those
with a family history are at even
greater risk.
Colon cancer is preventable— even
curable when detected early. In
fact, if cancer is found early enough,
the patient has more than a 90
percent chance of survival.
Colon cancer screenings are safe and
effective and are now covered by
Medicate and an increasing number

Students wage war against so-called ‘parking nazis’
J e r e m y H o u se w r ig h t
L ife st y l e S t r in o fr

Many students feel Parking Services has given them
the cold shoulder and several have been left with their
blood boiling.
Many students have waged war on the so-called
“parking nazis.”
What was once just a war of words has suddenly
taken a turn toward threats of violence. Fliers
were recently distributed calling for a war on the
“parking nazis.*’
Junior Brad Voelkerding, like countless other
students, was upset with Parking Services, namely the
appeals committee.
“I was not advocating any type of violence in writing
my letter to the editor,” Voelkerding said. “I just feel that,
in general, the appeals committee is way too strict. I feel
that the fines are way too high.”
Parking Services employees would not comment.
Voelkerding also said he has seen the fliers calling for
war on the “parking nazis” that were distributed and he
said they were ridiculous.
On Monday, Feb. 18, many tickets were issued for
vehicles parked on the grass when the Vadalabene Center
parking lot was closed to students. The uproar seemed to
gain momentum.
“The university didn’t even put up a sign and I was
late for my class because 1 had to drive all the way back
and park like five miles out of the way,” sophomore Jon
Meyer said. “It was ridiculous.
“Paying $60 to park and then having to walk five
miles is ridiculous. We should get a cushioned bus seat to
ride,” Meyer said. “All Parking Services does is ride
around and look for cars with no tags. I’m an anarchist
of Parking Services.”
“I always park at the VC and when it was shut down
for something that didn’t even involve the school, that
made me really angry,” sophomore Noah McCloud said.
McCloud said he thinks the university is just looking
to make more money.
“The students pay $60 a year to park and then
we lose our spots for some high school tournament
that has nothing to do with SIUE,” McCloud said. “It is
an outrage.”
McCloud is not alone in his anger with the university.
“I don’t like the Parking Services," freshman Sheena
Ady said. “It’s ridiculous.”
In a poll conducted on www.thealestle.com, 86
percent of students said the university should never close
the VC parking lot to students for special events.
“Even though students are complaining about the
cost of parking, they don’t have it as bad as students at
UMSL (University of Missouri-St. Louis) or some other
schools,” Voelkerding said.

“My friend goes to UMSL and he pays around $400
to be able to park there,” he said.
At Pennsylvania State University, students must park
nearly one mile away from campus and take a shuttle to
the buildings.
Not everyone had bad things to say about Parking
Services. A lot of students said they prefer the parking
hangtags to the stickers and are happy the change
was made.
“I think the new tags are cool,” Eric Woodcock said.
“If something happens and you can’t use your car, you
can put the tag in another one and use it.”
The fliers that were distributed were right about a few
things. If students want to be heard they should come
together. Students can call someone in power, such
as Parking Services, student government or write to
The Alestle.
Voelkerding’s letter to the editor got him a meeting
with Dean of Students Randy Rock.
“Rock is a very nice person and just wanted some
suggestions on what could be done to solve the problem,”
Voelkerding said. “He told me that the ticket fees and
the cost of the hangtags go toward the upkeep of the
lots because the university gets no money from the state
to do so.”
Rock also told Voelkerding the grounds crew charges
Parking Services to fix any damaged grass that is
parked on.
As for the VC, Voelkerding said Rock was looking
into having the lot open until 2 p.m. and then towing any
remaining cars still there after closing time.
“Rock said that if anyone has any reasonable
suggestions, they should feel free to contact him,”
Voelkerding said.
“I think that there should be a shuttle that picks up
students at the far red lots, especially on cold mornings,”
McCloud said.
“Parking Services should take it easy on the meters,”
Woodcock said. “There is no reason to give a ticket if the
person is a few minutes late.”
Woodcock also said that Parking Services should be
watching for people who are parked illegally.
“I am constantly seeing tickets being given for
overdue meters, even when the meter lot is empty, now
that is really pushing it,” Woodcock said. “What really
aggravates me is seeing all these people parking in the
white lines that aren’t spots. A person who goes over five
minutes can get a ticket but someone who has been
illegally parked for three or four hours gets off with
nothing. That really sucks.”
There doesn’t seem to be a clear solution to the
parking problem, but most students agree that violence is
not the answer. Contacting The Alestle or student
government is the best answer for now.

“I w ent in know ing I w as the
heavy favorite, and there w as a
lot o f pressure,” Skirball said,
“plus, the pressure o f needing to
run a faster tim e to stay up on the
(national) list.”
Skirball said the experience
prepared him som ew hat fo r the
eno rm ous am ount o f p ressu re
that will be on him this w eekend.
“I know I can do w ell if I
stay calm ,” Skirball said.
In high school, S k irb a ll’s
first race w as the 800-m eter run,
w hich he won.

W hile that win seem ed to
indicate an illustrious high school
track career, it was n ot to be.
G ranite C ity H igh School
already had a star half-m iler, so
Skirball specialized in the 400m eter instead.
However, when he qualified
for the state cham pionships his
senior year, he did so on G ranite
C ity ’s four-m em ber 800 -m eter
team.
The team finished fifth in the
state that year.
Now he seems to have com e

into his own, running to the top o f
a team that has boasted several
cham pionship half-m ilers in the
past.
T hat list o f runners includes
team m ate and training partner,
senior D an Walden.
W hile he is a b it high in the
clouds after his su ccess this
season, Skirball h asn ’t forgotten
how he has gotten here.
“T he biggest part o f w hy I
am at nationals is probably due to
Coach (Daryl) Frerker and D an,”
Skirball said.

Thursday, March 7, 2002 - 7:00pm, Conference Center - Morris University Center, SIUE
Book signing and reception following the talk in Goshen

Layli Miller Bashir, the Tahirih Justice Center's founder and chair, is an attorney in Washington, D.C. at the law firm of
Arnold & Porter practicing general litigation and international law. The author of numerous articles on gender-based
asylum law and female genital mutilation, Ms. Bashir co-authored the book, D o They H e a r You W h e n You C ry with her
former client Fauziya Kassindja.
In 1996, the United States Board of Immigration Appeals granted asylum to a young, Togolese woman, Fauziya
Kassindja, who fled her country to escape a tribal practice known as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). After seventeen
months and two weeks in maximum security prisons and Immigration and Naturalization Service detention facilities, Ms.
Kassindja won her Freedom with the help of Layli Miller. Ms. Miller was still in law school during the time she worked
on Ms. Kassindja's case. The case set national precedent and revolutionized asylum law in the United States, opening
the door to an entirely new basis for protection, gender-based persecution. In response to an outcry for assistance from
women in Ms. Kassindja's situation that was generated by international media coverage of her case, Layli M iller founded
the Tahirih Justice Center to provide free legal representation to women like Ms. Kassindja who face the threat of FGM
and other forms of gender-based abuse.
Sponsored by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Office of the Assistant Provost for Cultural and Social Diversity, Women's Studies department, the University Center Board, American Humanics,
Amnesty International, African Student Association, and United Campus Ministries.

Funded in whole or part by student activity fees.
