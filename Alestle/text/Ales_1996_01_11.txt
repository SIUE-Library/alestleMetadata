SIUE not taking misuse of
disabled parking lightly
By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
A problem has arisen on campus regarding the parking
spaces provided for disabled students and faculty—the problem
is not being taken lightly by the university.
“The problem stems from the suspicion that people are
misusing disabled parking spaces by parking in the provided
spaces without a decal, but with a state-provided handicap hang
tag,” Bob Vanzo, director of Administrative Services, said.
“It is University policy to purchase a handicapped decal,”
Vanzo said.
“Some faculty and students are unaware of this policy, and
some are just misusing the hang tags and parking in
handicapped spaces, which is unfair to those students and
faculty who really need to use these spaces,” Vanzo said.
According to Liz Tarpey, assistant director of Human
Relations, misuse of the hang tags is illegal. Disabled persons
should be in the vehicle when the disabled parking spaces are in
use. Non-disabled persons using the disabled hang tag of
another are subject to penalty under law.
“Violators are subject to $100 fines and towing,” Tarpey
said.
The university has created a plan of action to remedy the
problem of misusing the disabled parking spaces.

Students, faculty, staff and guests were treated to a
delightful, yet insightful speech by Patricia Russell-McCloud at
the 14th Annual Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. Luncheon
Wednesday in the Meridian
Ballroom.
Russell-McCloud, a native
of
Indianapolis,
Ind.,
entertained the lunch group
with her speech titled, “Hush,
Edwardsville
community.
Somebody’s
calling
our
names.”
Russell-McGoud began the
speech by saying that the
Edwardsville community was
making a major statement by
having the awards luncheon.
“We re

“They know that one plus one does not just equal two. If it is

in numbers.”

•EDWARDSVILLE, 111. (AP)—A G ranite City
man lured children as young as 7 into his mobile

Timothy W. Williams was charged Monday with

Williams taped children between the ages of 7

Snowstorm isn’t the only snow job in Washington
WASHINGTON (AP) _ Somehow, the big snow
job that buried back-to-work day for the federal
government seemed fitting. It was real, in contrast to
the political drifts piled around the budget struggle
that led to two partial shutdowns and isn’t settled
yet.
The argument is supposed to be over balancing the
budget. It is instead costing federal money, a lot of it,
more than $1.25 billion, according to the Office of
Management and Budget.
So far, that would be for 27 days’ worth of federal
pay for work that did not get done, for lost fees on
services and facilities that had to be shut, and for
such items as the $100 million a week of airline ticket
taxes that lapsed with the new year.
In middle America, far from the beltway, the
impression is that a closed government costs less. It
costs more.
And those are only direct government costs;
private contractors and small businesses have been
the losers, too.
The latest, three-week shutdown that affected
760,000 federal workers was settled, for now, when
President Clinton offered a revised seven-year
balanced budget plan, and House Republicans
approved the settlement for now, although they
don’t like his numbers and won’t buy them
permanently.
Clinton signed the measure Saturday night,
financing the government until Jan. 26, although
Republicans kept a hold on programs they don’t
favor, among them environm ental spending,
education aid and itemized stipends for states
instead of the less restricted block grants they
advocate.
That temporary settlement came just as the snow
began falling, prelude to the blizzard that heaped a
foot and a half of snow on a capital that can be
crippled by an inch or two. So on Sunday night, the
government decided to shut down all but emergency
services Monday. But budget negotiations at the
White House did resume, after a day’s delay because
of the storm, and Republicans offered to ease their
curbs on Medicaid and M edicare spending,

25 year SIUE professor files federal
lawsuit claiming racial discrimination
EAST ST. LOUIS, 111. (AP)—Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville is accused of racial
discrimination in a federal lawsuit filed by an educator who sought to teach a black studies class.
Edward W. Hudlin, an SIUE associate professor, contends he was placed on “excused leave”
with pay by the SIUE Department of Philosophical Studies, where he has worked for 25 years.
His lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court, contends the school’s action Friday centered
on a black studies course he was to begin teaching soon.
The class focused on the philosophical aspects of racism in the United States. It was designed
by Hudlin and would have been the first of its kind in the country, said Hudlin’s attorney, David
M. Harris.
Harris said the excused leave enacted Friday was tantamount to a suspension with pay.
The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order lifting the leave and damages of more than
$50,000.
David J. Werner, SIUE provost and vice president, who is among the officials named in the
lawsuit, declined to comment.

Effective as of this week, University Police and Parking Services will begin issuing tickets to
students and faculty who are parked in the handicapped spaces without a handicapped decal and
to those who are parked in lots not corresponding to the color of their decals.
“Tickets will bring everyone to the office, including visitors wishing to protest their tickets,”
Vanzo said.
Those wishing to purchase decals may do so, and hang tags will be checked to verify whether
the user purchased the tags legally.
“Those who have purchased the hang tags fraudulently will be towed and fined $100,” Vanzo
said.
Vanzo also said that violators will have to pay for towing and impound costs, which range from
$25 to $50.
People who continue to park in the wrong spots and refuse to pay tickets will be subject to an
immobilization boot being placed on their vehicle— the boot will not be removed until the fees
are paid.
The boot is a piece of circular equipment attached to the front wheel of the car, which will
immobilize it. The boot will not damage the vehicle as long as the owner does not try to move
the car or remove the boot.
Attached to the driver’s side window of the vehicle will be instructions telling the owner where
to go to have the boot removed.

“Leadership is not personality,” she said.
“It’s performance.
“We need bold and courageous leadership.
We need to look at higher education. We

Russell-McCloud also said she was very
pleased to see students giving their time to

“It’s more desirable to complain than it is

“When everybody dies, they will have a

U. of Washington professor continues personal, public fight against AIDS
SEATTLE (AP)—Speaking to University of Washington epidemiology
students, Dr. Bob Wood got right to the point.
“I’m a gay man. And I have HIV,” said Wood, who is beginning his second
decade as director of the Seattle-King County Health Departm ent’s AIDS
Control Program.
Colleagues say Wood’s tenacity and compassion have given science the upper
hand over politics in this region’s public-health debates over how to respond to
the AIDS epidemic, which is now the No. 1 killer of young men aged 25 to 44.
He has worked closely with community organizations to bring education,
condoms and clean needles to street youths, drug addicts and prostitutes—the
people most at risk, yet least likely to have access to health services.
“I think Bob’s real contribution has been recognizing the importance of not
waiting for the people who are most at risk to come into the clinic,” said Martin
Fishbein, the chief of behavioral intervention in the division of Sexually
Transmitted Disease Prevention at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.
“H e’s been able to keep a sustained, focused interest in controlling the disease
long after the sexy media coverage has disappeared,” added Dr. Bill Lafferty,
former chief epidemiologist for the state’s HIV-AIDS office. “1 really think that
if we hadn’t had the outreach programs we’ve had, it would be much worse
here.”
When Wood took the job in 1986, he said he didn’t expect he would be able to
keep it long. Most people live only 10 to 12 years after they are infected with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But Wood still works 60-hour weeks, overseeing a division with an annual
budget that has grown during his tenure from to $650,000 to $13 million.
“I joke with people that the stress of this job has kept my immune system
strong,” he said.
Dr. Hunter Handsfield, who recruited Wood, said he was a natural for the job:
an openly gay physician who was one of the first doctors in Washington to see
AIDS patients in 1982; a University of Washington medical school professor;
and a proven researcher who separated himself from the emotion surrounding
AIDS and used science to fight for sound public health policies.
When Wood wanted to start a needle-exchange program to prevent drug
addicts from sharing HIV-contaminated needles, critics charged it would

promote drug abuse and was perhaps illegal.
“Bob was the bridge” to getting opposing factions to agree on a program, said
Patricia Mclnturff, who headed the health departm ent’s regional division then.
“Everybody knew how much Bob cared about this. He wasn’t just another
bureaucrat who thought it would make a great research topic.”
Not all of his efforts have gone as smoothly.
In 1993, Wood supported a state proposal that would have required medical
labs to notify local health departments when patients’ blood tests indicated they
had AIDS. A t stake was the amount of federal funding the state would receive
for AIDS care.
But AIDS activists protested, arguing people would be less likely to get tested
because their confidentiality would be compromised.
It was during that debate that Wood revealed publicly he was HIV-positive, to
make the point that the activists did not speak for everyone suffering from HIV
or AIDS.
The state board of health ultimately adopted a compromise in which
laboratories conceal the identity of patients with a code before notifying health
departments.
“This very vocal minority vilified Bob for being a traitor to the gay
community,” Handsfield recalled. “It was very courageous of him to reveal his
HIV status then. It allowed him to counter some of the more extreme views of
AIDS activists, but it wasn’t something he had necessarily wanted to be totally
public.”
In another case, some King County Council members balked at a grant to pay
prostitutes to give free condoms to other prostitutes to prevent the spread of
HIV. But ultimately, after hearing testimony from Wood and others, the council
allowed the health department to keep the grant.
Wood says he finds it discouraging to have to fight for programs he believes
were proven valuable years ago.
“Politics often have more sway over public health programs than science, and
the losers are disenfranchised communities,” he said, noting the disease hits
disproportionately among homosexuals, drug users and poor minority
populations.
“Who is going to organize the poor and the disenfranchised? I don’t know.”
Wood said his greatest fear is the complacency that seems to be settling in
about AIDS. When he first began his job, he was asked to speak to community
groups about the disease two or three times a week. Now he gets
a request about once a month.
But he still has faith that public-health professionals can help
change behavior and save lives, and that AIDS could be
contained if youths are consistently bombarded with the message
to use condoms.
In the meantime, Wood says, he will continue to fight the fight.
“My life,” he said, “is AIDS.”

St. Louis public schools get
carbon monoxide detectors
ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Carbon monoxide detectors will be
installed at all 105 public schools here after a leak at one
school sickened more than 130 children and adults.
The leak occurred Friday at the Mullanphy Investigative
Learning Center, a magnet school, when a heating system
malfunctioned. None of the children or adults became
seriously ill.
Superintendent David J. Mahan said that in addition to the
detectors, the heating systems at all city schools will be
reinspected. School custodians will inspect boilers hourly
until the detectors are installed, probably within a month.
The commercial detectors are expected to cost about $100
apiece. Each school will have two.
Mullanphy will reopen today, school officials said.
Mahan said that never in his 38 years with the city schools
had there been a crisis like the one Friday. He credited
Mullanphy’s teachers for their handling of " a situation that
was frightening and scary and unreal.”
Dozens of police and firefighters converged at the school
Friday afternoon as more than 500 children were led to
safety. More than 130 children and teachers were taken to
area hospitals; at least 12 were treated.
Mahan said that Friday was the first day the school had
noticed any substantial sickness.
School officials say a damper in a heating vent failed to
open when the boiler got a signal from a thermostat to
produce more heat. When the damper failed to open, a
safety device on the boiler should have put out the boiler
flame. It didn’t. And because the damper was closed, there
was nowhere for the exhaust fumes to go, and carbon
monoxide built up. The fumes seeped into a nearby fan room
and got distributed throughout the school.
Carbon monoxide detectors are not required in schools.
Mahan said city school officials had talked before about
getting detectors but had decided not to because they were
not always reliable. But recent technology has improved
their reliability, he said.

Former professor wins $1 million discrimination settlement
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP)—A former assistant
professor of architecture at the University of
California here who claimed she was denied tenure
because she was an Asian woman has won a $1
million settlement.
“I’m very, very happy,” architect Marcy Wang
said after the out-of-court settlem ent was
announced Monday. “I think that it vindicates me
and it’s been a long, long journey.”
Wang joined the faculty at UC-Berkeley in 1979.
She was denied tenure in 1986 and again in 1988.
Her case went through a lengthy internal grievance
process and she filed suit three years ago.
According to a joint news release, the
settlement was one of the highest-paid by UC in
cases of alleged race or sex discrimination. But
UC-Berkeley officials denied that the settlement
was an admission of error.
“Neither race nor sex was a factor in Marcy
Wang’s denial of tenure,” said Vice Chancellor and
Provost Carol Christ.
“We were really m otivated by economic

factors,” she said.
An outside insurance policy which the university
no longer holds will cover $750,000 of the
settlement, Christ said, so paying the remaining
$250,000 was cheaper than going to court.
But Wang’s attorneys had another explanation.
“They were going to lose,” said J. Gary
Gwilliam, who represented Wang along with
attorney Marguerite Meade.
“It’s not just about money,” he said. “This was
about a courageous woman that took on this large
institution for many years.”
Victor Schacter, an attorney who has
represented management in employment cases,
said the settlement, while not unprecedented, was
“on the higher side,” for such cases.
But he said it would be “a clear mistake to read
into the size of the amount that there really was
any culpability on the part of the university.”
Wang acknowledged that her allegations might
seem surprising considering that UC-Berkeley now
has an Asian chancellor, Chang-Lin Tien, and its
undergraduate body is nearly 40 percent Asian.

“In fact, that mindset lulled me into thinking the
same thing before it happened to me,” she said.
“The problem is that the university is not a
homogeneous stew.”
Gwilliam said Wang was denied tenure because
“she did not fit the mold of the good old boys
club.”
He and Wang said she was not the target of
overt racist or sexist remarks, but was made to feel
unwelcome.
“It’s a m atter of ignoring her,” Gwilliam said.
Wang, now practicing privately in Berkeley,
maintained she was denied tenure after superiors
solicited unfavorable letters and excluded
favorable‘ones from a file being used to weigh her
candidacy.
She left the school in 1988. H er husband, who
also was a UC-Berkeley architecture professor, had
left previously.
She was not the first woman to charge
discrimination at UC-Berkeley.

Washington college class will lake prejudice tour
SPO K A N E (A P )—Jam es W aller was
born in the South, w here racism was
institutionalized after the Civil War.
But the South isn’t the only place where
racial prejudice existed.
The W hitworth College professor and 16
students are on a m onth-long study of
prejudice in the U nited States.
They’ll visit Chinatown in San Francisco,
a black history m useum in Chicago, a
Holocaust memorial in W ashington, D.C., a
civil rights museum in Memphis and M artin
Luther King Jr.’s birthplace in A tlanta.
“I want them to hear firsthand how people
experience prejudice,” said W aller, an
associate professor and chairm an of the
Presbyterian
college’s
psychology
departm ent.
The students’ classroom will be A m trak
railcars. T hey’ll spend nights in youth
hostels.
“I think it will broaden my perspective a
lot,” said Joy Crawford, 20, a sophomore
from Pleasanton, Calif.
Waller, who was born in the South, said it
is not as outw ardly racist
today as its legacy of slavery
would suggest.
But he wants his students
to learn about less obvious
types of racism, such as
discrimination in hiring and
housing.
One of the first stops is San
Francisco’s Chinatown, where
Waller wants students to learn
why Chinese
im m igrants
gathered
to
protect
themselves from racism in the
1800s.
They will also hear from
experts at the Institute for
Research on Social Problems
in Boulder, Colo, and talk
with a man who witnessed the
assassination of King.
They will attend a black
M ethodist
church
in
Washington, D.C., and tour a
H aitian voodoo museum in
New Orleans.
Waller said voodoo might
sound like black magic, but it

is a religion to many Haitians.
In Los Angeles, the class will attend a
lecture at the House of Blues to examine the
connection between black culture and blues
music.
But the class will not be making any
scheduled trips into inner cities of
m etropolitan areas, such as South Central
Los Angeles. H e said he is erring on the side
of safety.
The cost of the trip is $1,500 per student,
including travel, lodging and m useum
admissions. Meals are extra.
W hitworth devotes the month of January
for in-depth classes that focus on a single
subject. On W aller’s tour, students are
required to write a 12-page class paper and
keep a daily journal.
Waller said prejudice is a complex and
ingrained human trait, and that everyone
makes judgm ents about people.
“All of us perpetrate prejudice in various
forms at some point in our lives,” he said.
“Prejudice is much deeper than neo-Nazis
and skinheads.”

Survey says college freshmen are
less interested in student activism
WASHINGTON (AP)—Today’s college freshmen have little passion to push for political and
social reform, with rising numbers believing that individuals are powerless to bring about change,
a survey says.
The percentage of freshmen who think one person “can do little to change society” rose to
nearly 34 percent—a 10-year high, according to the annual survey conducted by the University
of California at Los Angeles.
“Apparently, increasing political apathy goes hand-in-hand with disengagement from social
action and a growing sense of powerlessness,” said Alexander W. Astin, director of the survey
conducted by UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute.
However, Joe Galli, chairman of the College Republican National Committee, cautions
against using survey results to make generalizations about the ranks of today’s college freshmen.
“I think student activism is at an all-time low ... not because of a sense of powerlessness, but
because they are cynical of government and false politicians,” Galli said. “And I think that is the
reason why they are becoming more conservative.”
The fall survey, sponsored by the American Council on Education, was given to 323,791
entering freshman at 641 two-year and four-year colleges and universities. Of these, 240,082
questionnaires from 473 institutions were used. The institute then weighted the data in an effort
to make it reflective of the views of the nation’s 1.5 million first-time college freshmen.
The survey showed that students’ commitment to keeping up-to-date with political affairs
dropped for a third straight year to an all-time low of 28.5 percent, compared with a high of
nearly 58 percent in 1966.
Freshmen have become less interested in influencing politics and social values, cleaning up the
environment and promoting racial understanding and participating in a community action
program. Since 1992, freshmen interest dropped from 3 percent to 11 percent in each of these
categories.
In the survey, college freshmen also voiced dwindling support for casual sex and legal
abortion. But they have more liberal views on marijuana, with those favoring legalization
reaching a 15-year high.
Support for keeping abortion legal rose steadily in the late 1980s, but in the 1995 survey, it
declined for the third straight year—to 58 percent.
In 1987, 52 percent of the freshmen responding to the survey supported casual sex. Now, 43
percent say it’s OK for two people to have sex even if they’ve only known each other a short time.
“There are more diseases and stuff. And I just don’t think people want to sleep with the first
person they meet. They want to get to know them better,” said Dennise Ledesma, an 18-year-old
freshman at California State University-Los Angeles.
Among college freshmen, the belief that homosexual relationships should be prohibited has

declined from a high of 53
percent in 1987 to an all-time
low of 30.6 percent. And
support
for
legalizing
marijuana has risen to nearly
34 percent—up from 17
percent in 1989.
“It’s so abundant. It’s no
big deal because everybody is
using it,” said Jason Zavada, a
19-year-old freshman at the
University of Kentucky who
supports legalization. “We
don’t see all the bad it’s
causing. It’s an insane policy
to treat people like criminals
for using something that
comes from the earth.”
More than
half the
freshmen surveyed labeled
their political views as
“middle-of-the-road.” But the
30-year-old
survey
says
growing bands of liberals and
conservatives are scooting
farther to the left and right.
“For the first time in the
history of the survey, we
have a situation where the
large m ajority of young
people are moving toward
the center at the same time
the small minorities at the
extrem es are growing,”
Astin said.
A majority of new college
freshmen expressed support
for the use of race as a basis
for college admission. The
freshmen,
however,
are
shying away from the term
“affirmative action.”
“This
discrepancy
highlights the fact that people
are willing to support the
consideration of race in
admissions, but are less
willing to commit themselves
to the more politically loaded
phrase, ‘affirmative action,”’
said Linda J. Sax, associate
director of the survey.

'Mr. Holland's Opus' has award-winning potential for Dreyfuss

“Mr. Holland’s Opus,” starring

When we’re young our dreams lie out

is to write one memorable piece of music
After a career teaching music rather than composing, Glenn Holland (Academy to leave his mark on the world. But

From drag queen to would-be royalty, Blackwell names worst dressed
LOS ANGELES (AP) _ One drag queen, several movie queens and one would-be
queen of England were skewered Tuesday by the razor tongued Mr. Blackwell in his
annual Worst Dressed Women list.
Cross-dressing shock-jock Howard Stem topped the list for laughs, but Blackwell
saved his sharpest jibes for Camilla Parker Bowles, Prince Charles’ consort and the
only non-entertainer on the list.
"Camilla reigns as the queen of fashion frump,” the former designer said. "Ms.
Bowles is the biggest bomb to hit Britain since the Blitz!”
He presented pictures of all his targets, including one of Bowles out shopping in
rumpled shorts and T-shirt and said, "What woman about to be Queen is going to
walk around shopping looking like this? ... Look at those bomber thighs!”
' How would I like to see Camilla Parker Bowles dressed?” he said in response to
a question. "Like a future queen _ and I don’t mean like me.”
Blackwell’s 36th annual worst dressed ritual drew hordes of photographers, camera
crews and reporters from many countries to his Hancock Park mansion.
1996 is my year.

heck do you mean
by “your year”?”
By Jennifer Casey
Throughout my
20 years of being, I
always envisioned a time where I would grow up
and leave childhood and its games, irresponsibility,
and no-rules attitude behind. Over the past couple
of years, that overwhelming need to grow up has
blanketed me like, well, the snow on this campus,
but it was not until January 6, 1996, that the drive,
determination, and down-right common sense
finally hit me.
Now is the time for me to become me.
I’m sure many of you can relate. Do you ever
have that feeling of being not yet an adult but no
longer a child? It’s kind of a funny, stuck in the
middle, where do I go, what do I do now kind of
feeling that can sometimes get uncomfortable in
times of decision making. You know, when you
have a huge test or paper coming up that you know
is vital to your grade (which is in turn vital to .your
future), but your friends want to go check out that

Famous women singled out for dishonors were rock singers Courtney Love and
Melissa Etheridge and actresses Drew Barrymore, Whoopi Goldberg, Diane Keaton,
Jennifer Jason Leigh, Emma Thompson and Christina Applegate.
A special "booby prize” was presented to former Guess! model Anna Nicole
Smith, who gained fame fighting for the estate of her late millionaire husband.
"Quick, cover your eyes,” Blackwell exclaimed, as he presented a picture of the
zaftig Smith bulging out of two different gowns.
Blackwell, who was designing dresses for the rich and famous when he originated
the list in 1960, said it was meant to encourage celebrities to set a fashion example
for women everywhere. He commended Barbra Streisand and Madonna, past worstdressed targets, for changing their images and becoming "absolutely gorgeous.”
Putting Stem at the top of the list was fair, he said, because the radio personality
makes public appearances in drag.
Asked if he would ever give up razzing the worst dressed with his annual list,
Blackwell said, "Yes. When I’m dead. 1 want to be the world’s most famous bitch. I
am the mother of negativity.”

new club or your boyfriend/girlfriend has the
sudden urge to go do something spontaneous and
romantic, and suddenly researching Marxist
Germany or absorbing chemical equations loses its
priority?
The adult side of you says “you must study now
in order to pass this class and be happy,” and the
little kid side of you says “oooh!! Fun!! Let’s go!!”
What do you do?
In my case, I usually cave into that fun side (and
past grades have shown it), but all of a sudden,
getting through school on a high note, meeting
Alestle deadlines and coming up with good story
ideas, and improving my personal development
has possessed my inner being.
I’m not gonna say that I will remain chained to
my computer for the rest of my life (I said
responsible, not dead), because not only will
Carpal-Tunnel syndrome kick in, but I’ll become a
hermit, and that is not my goal. The friends that I
usually ditched the homework for to succumb to
peer pressure will either understand what I’m
trying to do or go on without me, in which case it
will be easy to figure out who the real friends are.
My relationship with my incredibly wonderful
sweetheart will not suffer, either. He’s been where
I am and knows what I’m going through, and
although we’d love to spend every waking minute
together, we understand that it’s just not possible.
We’ll be learning to enjoy what time we do get to
spend together to the fullest. After all, what fun am
I goipg to be if I bomb out of school?
I’m not trying to crack on anyone’s lifestyle. If

you can party and still get awesome grades, more
power to you. I wish I knew your secret. I’m just
not one of those people, and for years, I’ve been
trying to convince myself that I was, and to no
avail.
So what if I can’t watch a “Friends” marathon
because I have a TVR test the next day? That’s
the nice thing about videotape!
This whole time that I’ve lived under this veil of
cluelessness, thinking that if I didn’t get out there
and be social or didn’t do this or didn’t do that I’d
miss out on some big adventure, my life would not
be up to snuff.
The reality of it is, I’ve missed out on a lot by
not managing my time to include responsibility,
priority, and a whole lot of fun.
I’m going to turn 21 in less than seven months,
and by that time, the year of “me” will be half over.
In the time between now and then, I have a lot of
goals that I want to reach, and I’m sure that there
are many of you out there who set personal goals
for the new year. Don’t lose sight of them.
Whether you plan on giving up soda, growing
out your hair, saving money, or making straight
A’s, you’ll feel so great knowing that you’ve busted
your butt to reach your goal. It’s a euphoric feeling
that I plan on getting to know a lot better in 1996.
Clubs close. Friends go home. The buzz wears
off. Those $70 dollar shoes that you spent your
rent money on will be out of style next season.
Have fun, but be good to yourself. The “party”
that you have inside yourself after achieving
something or accomplishing a goal never ends.

LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Madonna, the sultry and flamboyant entertainer, probably inspires fantasies
of marriage and the like in many men, but most don’t threaten to kill her if she refuses to walk down
the aisle.
Robert Dewey Hoskins did that and more.
Twice, he scaled the walls of her estate, nestled in the Hollywood Hills. He told Madonna’s
bodyguard that he would slit her throat from ear to ear if she refused to marry him. The harassment
ended when Hoskins was shot by her bodyguard and arrested last spring.
On Monday, the case came to a close when Hoskins was convicted of stalking, assault and making
terrorist threats against the pop star.
Madonna is just the latest celebrity to be hounded by an obsessed fan. The list includes David
Letterman, Michael J. Fox, Sharon Gless, Roberta Flack and Lesley Stahl, just to name a few.
Sitting on the witness stand last week in Hoskins’ trial, Madonna said she felt sick to her stomach
being there.
" I feel incredibly disturbed that the man who threatened my life is sitting across from me and he has
somehow made his fantasies come true,” Madonna said. " I ’m sitting in front of him and that’s what he
wants.”
Others have had to endure more than just harassment. Actress Theresa Saldana survived a savage
stabbing; "My Sister Sam” star Rebecca Schaeffer was shot to death on her doorstep by a man who
hired a detective to get her address; and John Lennon was killed by an deranged fan outside his New
York City apartment.
Stalkers who target celebrities, experts say, have poor self-images and, in many cases, suffer from
mental illness.
"A lot have really low self-esteem and in order to build themselves up, if they get closer to these
individuals, it will elevate them in society and with themselves,” said police Detective Greg Boles,
assistant officer in charge of an LAPD stalking unit.
In all, about 95 percent suffer some sort of mental disorder, said psychiatrist Park Dietz, head of the
Threat Assessment Group, a consulting practice in Newport Beach.
For instance, Robert Bardo, the man convicted of killing the 21-year-old Schaeffer in 1989, had been
schizophrenic since childhood, Dietz testified at his trial.
Dietz also testified at the trial of John Hinkley, who attempted to assassinate President Reagan in
1981 to impress actor-director Jodie Foster.
"Both Hinkley and Bardo were men of no accomplishment who perceived the women they were
pursuing as highly accomplished, wonderful people,” Dietz said. "Though they believed the women of
their dreams were superior to them, they thought they were such wonderful people, that they might be
able to attract their attention if they gave it enough devotion.”
Dietz said Madonna was exactly right when she said her presence in the courtroom made Hoskins’
fantasy come true.
"This is the ultimate achievement for the pursuer,” Dietz said, "and such an obvious reward of
perverse motives.”
Prosecutors in the Hinkley case vigorously fought against Foster having to testify in person and
avoided it by having her do so on videotape.
When the videotape was shown in court, Hinkley ' 'threw his pencil at the video monitor,” Dietz
recalled.
Madonna wasn’t so lucky. The judge denied her attorney’s request to either remove Hoskins from the
courtroom and let him watch her testimony via closed-circuit TV or allow Madonna to testify from
another location.
If Hoskins were removed, the judge ruled, it would send a prejudicial message to the jury that he
was too dangerous to be in the star’s presence. Madonna reluctantly testified after being threatened
with a $5 million arrest warrant.
Stalking incidents similar to Madonna’s prompted California in 1990 to became the first state to
make stalking a crime. Every state but Maine has since enacted such a law.
That same year, the LAPD launched the Threat Management Unit. Of the 200 cases it handles a year,
about 30 percent involve celebrities, Boles said. Each of the unit’s six detectives act as liaisons to three
or four movie studios.

Living the ‘Dream
Below are th e winning e n trie s for th e "Living th e Dream" poetry and essay co n test. The essay a p p e a rs in excerpts, while
th e poem is printed in its entirety.
By H eath er T h om p son
By B rooke S ato ry
Each of us sh o u ld live th e d ream
The d ream of Dr. Martin L uther King, Jr.
On th a t g rea t day th a t m illions will never forget
The day Dr. King sto o d a t th a t mighty p ed estal,
And told o u r nation his d ream .
We sto o d and listened.
Yet th e q u estio n is,
"Did we listen?"
The beloved m an w ho fought an d died
for p e o p le 's rights
W anted o n e sim ple thing.
For all o f u s to b e equal.
The law s ta te s th a t we are,
Yet are we?
We sta n d h ere today with so
m uch an g er an d hate,
T eaching o u r children to h a te
o n e a n o th e r and not to love.
Is th a t w hat h e w anted,
W hat we truly want,
For o u r nation to be
destroyed by h ate ?
I a sk m yself th e q u estio n ,
W hat is so different a b o u t
us,
You an d m e?
J u s t b e c a u se your skin is
o n e color and m ine is
an o th er,
Do we not sh a re th e
sa m e blood,
The sa m e tea rs?
Do we not sh a re th e
sa m e pain,
The sa m e anguish?
Do we not sh a re th e
sa m e beliefs,
The sa m e belief th a t
th ere is a G od?
You and 1 live in two different worlds th a t are th e sa m e
You an d 1 are th e only h o p e for th e future.
We sh o u ld m ake a m e n d s.
Yet are we willing?
C oretta King,
R em em bering w hen Dr. King sp o k e of his dream ,
Said it b e st w hen sh e sta te d ,
"At th a t m o m e n t it se e m e d a s if th e Kingdom of God
a p p e a re d .
But it only lasted for a m om ent."
Why can we not m ake th a t o n e m o m e n t a p p e a r again,
Yet m ake it m o re th an a m o m en t
Make it a lifetim e?
For, my b ro th er an d sisters,
We are truly o ne.
You and I,
Truly o n e to g e th e r for a lifetim e,
And w hen it c o m e s dow n to it,
A lifetim e is not th a t long.
We sh o u ld let th e h a te go.
And we will m e e t to g e th e r w here we truly belong,
Living th e d ream ,
O ur d ream ,
As o n e.

It w as August 29, 1962, w hen Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
gave his fam ous "I Have a Dream" sp e e c h to a culturally
diverse crowd consisting of over two h u n d red fiftyth o u sa n d people. Being a ch arism atic leader, he cap tu red
his au d ie n ce and enveloped th em with his philosophy, lie
w as a m an who d e d ic ated his life to im proving Am erican
society. J u s t a s h e strongly enforced in his 1964 Nobel
Peace Prize a c c e p ta n c e sp e e c h , Dr. King indicated th at
' injustice, poverty, an d war were all u n p leasan t
a sp e c ts o f o u r society which provided m ajor
se tb a c k s in th e q u e st for com plete
freedom . Unfortunately, th e goals he set
for o u r nation have not all b een
achieved. But if h e w ere to look at
Am erica an d its citizens'
acco m p lish m en ts, h e would not be
d isap p o in ted . This g rea t m an
realized th a t a ttitu d e s d o not
ch an g e overnight. His h e art would
not have to search long before
discovering th a t his d ream is
so m eth in g th a t we, his people,
have strived for in th e past, are
striving for presently, and will
co n tin u e to strive for in th e future.
Together, a s a nation, we are well
on o u r way to acquiring w hat will
b e co m e o n e of m a n 's g rea test
a sse ts ...
... Tom orrow is a new day, th u s
m aking anything po ssib le. This
sta te m e n t is especially applicable to
to d ay 's A m ericans. O ftentim es, we face
m uch o pposition for o u r :dealistic
views. This was, no d o u b t, th e c ase with
Dr. King. He had m any su p p o rte rs but, at
th e sa m e tim e, m ad e e n e m ie s a s a result
of his preaching. It would tak e m ore th an
m a n 's ordinary d isp leasu re, however, to
discourage him. We, th e p eo p le of Am erica,
m ust continue to work tow ard o u r goals in th e sam e
m an n e r a s he if su c c e ss is to b e co m e a reality. Dr. King
focused on th e future in m uch of his work. It m akes
perfect se n s e th a t society sh o u ld also do this, for it is
only in th e future th a t freedom will co m e. The key to
acquiring this freedom is th e practice o f se rio u s and
continued ed u catio n . O ur society m ust, a s it h as d o n e in
all of its p ast an d p resen t efforts, co n tin u e to fight like
never before to achieve o u r d ream . We have
d e m o n stra te d o u r a d v an c em en t by firmly sup p o rtin g
Colin Powell, a form er A m erican Army general and
chairm an of th e United S ta te s Jo in t Chiefs o f Staff, who
h as th e potential to o n e day lead o u r nation. A m ericans
can also find a great, lasting h o p e in th e a ssu ra n c e th at
anything is p ossib le in th e future.
While living th e d ream h a s proved so m ew h at m ore
difficulty th an e x p ec te d , o u r nation is n o t w ithout hope.
J u s t a s with Dr. King, A m ericans find com fort in the
prom ise of a new day. Though th e d ream he had in m ind
may not have b een com pletely fulfilled, we have th e
ability to achieve th a t which he d esired . O ur socjety h as
also learned from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. th a t
p reju d ices m ust be ab o lish ed in o rd e r to live in harm ony,
poverty m ust c e a se to exist in o rd er to stren g th en this
nation, an d war m u st c o m e to an en d , th u s m aking p eace
a c o n sta n t which p revents us from destroying all th a t we
have already d o n e to p ro m o te all th a t is good. O nce each
and every m e m b e r o f o u r A m erican society arrives a t a
b e tte r u n d erstan d in g o f and successfully fulfills all of
th e s e ideas, we can indisputably say th a t we are truly
living th e dream .

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr
By Darryl H ow lett
L ifesty le E ditor
It's b e e n a lm o st thirty years sin ce Dr.
Martin L uther King Jr. d e p a rte d this
world, leaving behind him
a ch iev e m e n ts which could fill th e
lives o f five p eo p le. In this age of
violence, racial ten sio n and
a tta c k s on civil rights laws,
c u rre n t an d future g e n eratio n s
sh o u ld tak e a look a t th e legacy
Dr. King left behind.
Ju lio u s McNeese, a ssista n t
d irecto r o f sch o o l and college
relatio n s, said he feels th a t
keeping Dr. King's legacy alive is
m ore im p o rtan t now th an ever.
"Yes, my Lord. To m e, Martin
Luther King is th e tru e m ea su re
o f a m an. He pu t him self below
th e n e e d s o f all," McMeese said.
S tu d en t body p re sid e n t Ram on
Blakely also s e e s a p u rp o se in
continuing King's legacy.
"It is very im p o rtan t to k eep th e
legacy alive—not only th e legacy—
b u t th e w illingness to go against th e
grain like h e did. Dr. King w as
willing to m ake a change. We
n e ed m o re o f th a t spirit on
cam p u s," Blakely said.
Blakely a n d McMeese
also s e e several ways
in which stu d e n ts can
k eep his d ream alive.
"The b e s t le a d er is
o n e w ho serv es. College stu d e n ts m u st realize th a t to be a
g rea t leader, you m u st b e a g rea t follow er—and Dr. King
w as both," McNeese said.
S o m etim es it is hard for th e p re se n t generatio n to know
w hat stru g g les Dr. King w ent through. A questio n th a t can
b e ask ed is "Will th e nex t g en eratio n be ab le to sto p th e
p re se n t situ atio n s of gang w arfare, racial violence and
d eg rad atio n of African-Am ericans?"
S om e stu d e n ts feel th a t Dr. King's legacy will never be
tak en away.
"I d o n 't ever think you can destroy Dr. King's legacy. The
reaso n being is th a t th e life he led h a s a real su b sta n c e
th a t eac h individual can identify with," Audrey Sm ith, a
so p h o m o re m ajoring in e le m e n tary e d u ca tio n who is also

th e p erso n n el/p u b lic relatio n s chair for stu d e n t
governm ent, said.
"lie sto o d for tru th , h o nesty and
he truly loved p eo p le regardless of
race. And in th e United S tates, race
is su c h a big issue. We will always
look to his exam ple," sh e said.
O thers se e King's legacy as
pointing to a n eed for AfricanA m ericans to "get their
h o u se in o rd er first" before
working on o th er solutions
for th e country.
"B rothers and sisters
n e ed to c o m e to g eth er
m ore. We ten d to fly off the
h an d le with fighting and
violence. After we can
co m e to g eth er a s a people,
th en we can help everybody
else," said Leon Beard, 25,
a so p h o m o re m ajoring in
accounting.
C hancellor Belck,
who recently retu rn ed from a
MAACP m eetin g in Dallas,
T exas, talk ed a b o u t continuing
th e legacy o f Dr.King.
"We a sso c ia te d Martin
Luther King with his d ream and his
fam o u s T Have A D ream ' sp eech .
People could relate with w hat he
sto o d fo r—su p p o rt for all hum an
beings. I believe his m essag e will
b e co m e even m o re im portant
during th e
coming years," Belck said.
B ecause of th e in crease in crim e an d violence in AfricanAm erican com m unities, the m essa g e o f non-violence
e x p re ssed by King is now m ore im p o rtan t th an ever.
"I think th e non-violence m u st b e em p h asized . We can
go fu rth er with non-violence th an with violence. The
m essag e of violence is attrac tiv e —especially to young
African-American m en —b e c a u se o f society glorifying
g a n g ster's life.
"A lot of young p eo p le have th is 'I g o ts to get m ine'
m entality. W hat o u r p eo p le m u st realize is th a t g a n sta 's
d o n 't live long. They (people) are em u latin g w hat they see
on television, getting things quick, fast a n d in a hurry,"
McMeese said.

On Education: “The function of education ... is to teach one to think

ABC brings Spielberg sportsflavored sitcom to prime time
LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Ladies and gentlemen, starting at forward, guard AND center for
DreamWorks SKG: "Cham ps.”
After all the dizzying dealmaking, the awe-inspiring accumulation of talent, credits, cash and
property, the embryonic Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen studio is fielding its first product, a
sports-flavored sitcom for ABC debuting at 9:30 p.m. Wedsnesday nights. "Champs,” created
by producer Gary David Goldberg of "Family Ties” and "Brooklyn Bridge” fame, stars
Timothy Busfield ("thirtysomething”) as a dedicated family man with another love _ his high
school basketball buddies.
Ashley Crow co-stars as Busfield’s patient spouse, whose wifely tolerance is of epic 1950s
proportions. Ed Marinaro, Kevin Nealon, Ron McLarty and Paul McCrane play the malebonding contingent.
The series gets prime playing time with its post-" Home Improvement” slot. Teaming up with
ABC’s top-rated series ensures audiences will at least sample "Cham ps.”
The first DreamWorks project in a dreamy slot _ talk about pressure. Except _ shush! _ to
Goldberg, who’s trying to avoid fretting about being the first to carry the DreamWorks colors.
"T he only thing that would make me sad is if people didn’t like the show and took it out on
DreamWorks,” he said.
" If you don’t like the show, it’s clearly my fault. No one else is making any decisions about
the show. These guys are perfect partners and left me completely alo n e.... I wouldn’t want to
see them get slammed for my inadequacy.”
Not that Goldberg, or DreamWorks, thinks slamming is in order.
" I think in the world of doing what we do, this is as good as it gets,” said Jeffrey Katzenberg,
the ex-Disney executive who joined with filmmaker Steven Spielberg and record mogul David
Geffen to create DreamWorks.
The year-old company unveiled plans last month for a $200 million studio development in
the Los Angeles area intended to house its TV, film, music and interactive operations.
For his part, Katzenberg appears unfazed by suggestions of the scrutiny awaiting
DreamWorks’ firstborn.
"F or us, the determination of a successful first outing is not whether the show can have a 35
(ratings) share. It is 'H ow good is it?’ ... We can do no more than try and provide the best
possible environment and support for the talent to do their job.”
"A nd then we’ll be in the hands of the TV gods and it will have to take its course,”
Katzenberg said.
Goldberg knows how unkind the gods can be. He watched his lovely, evocative "Brooklyn
Bridge” _ drawn from childhood memories _ tumble down after CBS yanked it ruthlessly
around its schedule.
"Cham ps” seems unlikely to receive such callous treatment. But Goldberg contends its
choice time slot is proof of ABC’s regard for the show, not just its royal pedigree.
" If they didn’t like the show, it wouldn’t be on 9:30 Tuesday no m atter who did it, even if it
was Steven with his Bar Mitzvah pictures.”
Forget Spielberg; these snapshots belong to Goldberg. "Cham ps” draws on his abiding love
of amateur sports, the boyhood relationships he maintains to this day and his 26-year marriage.
" In my mind, this is the best work I’ve ever done,” the TV veteran said. "This is not an easy
world to show, and I’m trying to show it with some complexity.”
The world is unrelated to the hijinks of "Friends” and other sitcoms fixated on young singles.
Busfield’s Tom McManus is a happily married man, a devoted dad and a gainfully employed
city planner.
H e’s thoroughly wedded, as well, to the old friends who still gather to shoot baskets and
reminisce about Big Games won and lost.
"This is totally counter to every other show this year,” Goldberg said. "There are no other
family sho^Vs, no shows about people in their 30s, about married people. This is very counter to
the prevailing wisdom, which is exactly where I like to be. It’s a little risky.”
H e’s buoyed by the support of those he calls "his biggest fans” _ the DreamWorks team. For
its part, the studio is already looking to the next project, "High Incident,” a police drama
starting production for ABC.
"M ore, better, bigger,” a cheerful Katzenberg says of DreamWorks’ future.
Go team.

Information superhighway
makes stop at 19th century
one-room school
QUINCY, 111. (AP) _ Only nine students, ranging in age
from 7 to 14, attend the Seventh-day Adventist School,
contained in one room still heated by a wood stove.
Although the building overlooks an interstate highway,
two students ride horses to school.
But while the school tries to keep its 19th-century
traditions and values alive, the 21st century has begun
encroaching.
Over in one corner of the room, students eagerly try out a
new computer equipped with CD-ROM.
Curriculum at the school includes reading, writing and
arithmetic, as well as Bible and religious studies. Students
also are taught manners, how to respect other people and
basic skills like how to use small tools and how to make
small repairs.
The children also do community service, such as collecting
food and clothing for the poor, singing for elderly residents
at nursing homes and cleaning the school building.
" I believe healthy self-esteem comes only from service to
other people,” said Dennis Shelton, principal and primary
teacher at the school.
That work paid off when the school won a computer from
a local business for collecting cans of food.
Students have taken to the computer "like ducks to
water,” Shelton said. "D uring recess time, they race right
over.”
The Seventh-day Adventist church has operated a school
in Quincy since the early 1900s. Students have been
attending classes at the current site for about 10 years. Most
of the students at the school are Seventh-day Adventists,
although students from other faiths are welcome.
Shelton said the school has a strong academic record.
"M any of the eighth-graders who have graduated have
tested at 11th- or 12th-grade reading levels. After they finish
high school, most have gone on to college and entered
professional programs,” he said.
The small enrollment at the Seventh-day Adventist School
means that this year, the school has no first- or fifth-graders.
But students say they don’t mind being in classes by
themselves.
" If you don’t understand something, you usually have a
teacher free,” said student Brian Barnhurst. "You also get
to work independently.”
With only nine students, the school is at its lowest
enrollment in some time. The ideal would be between 16
and 20 students, Shelton said.
With that in mind, the church plans to begin construction
on a gymnasium at the school this spring.
Although some consider the school a quaint throwback,
Shelton said students and parents prefer the one-room
schoolhouse.

Television show leads to capture of fugitive
GASTONIA (AP) _ For accused child molester Ricky Allen Bright, the third strike ended the game.
Bright, wanted in connection with the Oct. 8 rape and kidnapping of a Wilkes County girl, was captured in Nashville, Tenn., about 3 a.m. Sunday after a caller
to "A m erica’s Most Wanted” led police to the Continental Inn.
It was the third time the show had splashed Bright’s face and criminal history across TV screens nationwide.
"W e’ve kept our fingers crossed every time that show aired. I never lost faith,” said Wilkes County Sheriff’s Lt. Mike Farrington.
Bright, 41, who was one of the FBI’s "Ten Most Wanted” fugitives, faces a federal charge of interstate flight to avoid prosecution, as well as the sex charge.
Bright likely will be returned to North Carolina to stand trial after being ordered held without bond pending a preliminary hearing on Thursday. The suspect
appeared Monday before U.S. Magistrate William J. Haynes Jr. A federal public defender was appointed to represent Bright.
The October assault happened less than a year after Bright’s early release from Raleigh’s Central Prison, the maximum-security prison where he served 17
years in prison for the 1979 rape and kidnapping of a 7-year-old Gastonia girl.
Citing good behavior, the state’s parole board granted Bright an early release.
The release came despite pleas from the girl’s family and Gastonia Police who handled the case.
I am very happy that he is in custody,” said Gastonia Police Major Rodney Parham, who investigated the 1979 assault and has kept in contact with the family
since Bright’s release.

Wrestlers visit Indianapolis over
break—Carter finishes fourth
Preparing for SIU E Invitational Saturday at VC
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
Over the break the SIUE wrestling team ventured over to the University of
Indianapolis to take part in the school’s 16 team tournament and during their stay
the Cougars best finish was fourth place by sophomore Jason Carter in the 190pound division.
There was a very good chance of a higher place finish in the 134-pound
bracket for the Cougars, but junior Shawn Hickey had to default to sixth place
after he stretched some cartilage in his ribs during the semi-final match.
“This really hurts us because he his a good one and I don’t know how long he
will be out,” head coach Larry Kristoff said in his office Wednesday afternoon
about his wrestler.
Junior Kris Davis finished the tournament in fifth place while wrestling at 158
pounds. Also senior Jayson Querciagrossa finished seventh in the 142-pound
bracket.
Over the course of the season the Cougars have endured several injuries that
have not helped Kristoff put the best possible team on the mat.
“Take away the injuries and we have a good wrestler at each weight class.
Each night you got to put the best team on the mat and at this time this is the best
team.
“Jayson Carter has been wrestling very well. (Chris)McElwee and (Brian)
Anderson are two tough kids. We have a good team on the mat when healthy,”
Kristoff said
The Cougars have mainly participated in tournaments this year and only have
one dual meet under their belt, which was a loss to the University of Illinois.
Over the weekend the Cougars will take part in their own tournament, the
SIUE Invitational. It is an 11-team tournament which consist of the No. 1
nationally ranked division II team of Central Oklahoma and the No. 3 NAIA team
Missouri Valley.
The Invitational is going into its third year at SIUE, but it spent over twenty
years as the Southwest Missouri State Invitational. After the wrestling program
was dropped at SW Missouri State, SIUE picked it up.
The tournament also has the winner of the 142 pound weight class coming
back to defend his crown. Randy Roark from Missouri Valley beat Querciagrossa
1-0 last year in the final and could have the chance to do it again.
The invitational will begin at 9 a.m., in the Vadalabene Center.

“When we got there on Friday, he told me

about coaching his son Allie, “I like all my

Lewis who first interested M argenthaler in
becoming a coach.
“Since I was a sophomore in high school, with
Don Stanton as my coach, I knew that I wanted
to coach someday,” he said, giving credit to the
man who he also said influenced his coaching
style.
“I just liked his style,” he said with a sense of
admiration and respect in his eye. “His players
were always so important to him, he tried to not
only teach them basketball, but teach them
about life.”
The impact of Stanton’s teachings about life
may be the biggest contribution anyone made to
Margenthaler’s coaching style, and this showed
as he described his greatest moment as a coach.
