SIUE celebrates Black
history month, focus
is on inclusiveness
■ BY ZHANDA JOHNSON
NEWS EDITOR
Black history month at SIUE
encourages inclusiveness as events for the
month begins.
SIUE began celebrating Black History
Month yesterday with the first Annual
Black History Month Luncheon. Freeman
Bosley Jr., former and first AfricanAmerican mayor of St. Louis, delivered
the keynote address.
Darron Cannon, bursar and chairman
of the Black History Committee, said
inclusiveness is the goal for SIUE’s Black
History celebration.

“We developed this year’s program
with inclusiveness in mind,” Cannon said.
“It is our hope that the 1998 program not
only will be interesting and fun, but will be
a step toward opening a constructive
dialogue on issues affecting society and
create an environment which will be
conducive to racial harmony.
The theme for Black History Month is
“Shaping the Economic, Political,
Educational and Cultural Agenda for the
Next Millennium.” All activities and
events have been created to focus on a
different topic for each week. Week one
focuses on economic issues; week two,
political; week three, education; and week
four, cultural.

Edwardsville residents voice strong opinions
against the proposed building of Amphitheater
■ BY AMANDA BARTON
NEWS STRINGER
After voicing their opinions at the
Edwardsville City Council meeting,
some Edwardsville residents still
strongly oppose the proposition of the
amphitheater because they feel it will
interrupt their quality of life. Some
opponents have even formed a formal
group
called
Neighbors
for
Amphitheater
Awareness
(NAA).

opposition to the proposed Amphitheater. 10, 000 .

“It’s just not a good thing at all,”
Dolores Story Kaufman said. Kaufman,
a resident of Tiger Road in Edwardsville
Township, feels that the amphitheater
would bring increased traffic, noise,
drug and alcohol use, and crime. She
also said it would interrupt the wildlife
that currently resides on the land where
the amphitheater would be built.
Another
opponent
of
the
amphitheater, A1 Wentz of Old Poag
Road, said he thinks if it properly done
it will be a great benefit to the area.
However, he feels as though the
developers of the project have not

thought through the plan carefully. For
example, he explained, that the sound
test done on the property should have
been conducted before anyone even had
the chance to voice concern.
Wentz is also concerned that the
amphitheater will not be a family
oriented place. He feels that if the
amphitheater is built, it should be
operated much like the Muny in St.
Louis. In his opinion, the grounds
should be beautiful and have plenty of
space for families to enjoy their time
together.

■ BY RENEE HOLLER
NEWS STRINGER
Sara Elizabeth Ammann,
daughter of Dennis and Mary Lou
Ammann and a senior at SIUE, is
one of only 22 university students
in the nation to receive a $2000
Phi
Eta
Sigma
national
scholarship. Phi Eta Sigma is an
academic honor society that
inducts students based on high
achievement
during
their
freshman year of college.

The valedictorian of the
Highland High School Class of
1994, Ammann is majoring in
biology
and
minoring
in
chemistry and intends to graduate
from SIUE with a bachelor's
degree and teaching certificate in
biology in December 1998.
“Sara is extremely bright,
very interested in academic
success and achievement, and
very committed to the welfare of
others,” Dr. Janet McReynolds,
faculty advisor of the SIUE

chapter of Phi Eta Sigma, said.
In addition to singing in the
Concert Chorale at SIUE,
Ammann is also very involved in
singing and performing at the
Lincoln Theatre in Belleville.
“My
first
love
is
performance. It’s such a high,
such a rush,” Ammann said.
Ammann teaches Sunday
school and is the youth director at
First Congregational Church in
Highland. She truly enjoys her
position, despite the hard work.

“I just love the kids, they are
so much fun to be around,”
Ammann said
Every summer for the past
eight years, Ammann has
volunteered at Camp His Kids, an
overnight camp for children with
cancer and their siblings, in
Imperial, Mo. She feels this
experience has helped her to be a
much more caring and loving
individual.

Single-parent students address their needs
■ BY JASON
TRIPLETT
STAFF REPORTER
For some students on the
Southern Illinois University at
Edwardsville, campus life is full
of pencils, books, diapers, and
Power Rangers.
Along with term papers and
exams, single-parent students
have to deal with elementary
school
schedules,
money
problems and limited childcare.
Six single parents showed up
to voice their needs at the spring
semester’s first SIUE Soup and
Substance forum last Thursday.
The forum was created for SIUE
students to discuss campus and
non-campus issues in a relaxed
environment over a steaming cup
of minestrone, chile, or this
meeting’s pick, chicken soup.

Nearly half of the Cahokia
Room, a small elongated room in
the University Center, was filled
with parents, faculty and
interested students.
Topics containing emotion,
anger and overall concern were
discussed among the participants.
The parents’ troubles ranged
from not enough time, not
enough money, to not enough
understanding
from
the
university administration and
faculty about their particular
needs.
“We think the university
system needs to be more open to
single
parents’ situations,”
Senior,
Family
Resident
Assistant and single parent,
Kirsteen Laidlaw said.
Starting with the child care
system, most of the parents want
small changes that will help in
their quest to attain a college

Know

l j o u p

degree. Currently, SIUE’s Early
Childhood Development Center
takes only 2-and-a-half-year-old
children and older. The services
cost $1,500 per child a semester.
For the parents that are without
government help, the cost is steep
and the resources too limited.
“The facilities are good and
the child care philosophy is
excellent. We don’t know why
they won’t take the younger
children,” Senior, Elementary
Education major and single
parent, Brandy Kirkbride said.
These parents are so busy
that even time to interact with
other students is limited. Cocurricular activities and social
lives are out of the question. The
feeling of isolation, due to no
time and lack of human peace of
mind, adds to stress of academic
life for the parents.
Positives of being a single­

parent student are limited and are
taken when the opportunity
presents itself.
“I like to talk to the students
and staff working at the Early
Childhood Center,” Kirkbride
said. “It’s also nice to know that
you can call a fellow parent,
scream at them to release stress
and they will understand. But
sometimes, it’s not enough
because often no one is around;
they have schedules too.”
Out of these many negatives
come some positive highlights of
being a single-parent and a
student. Laidlaw thinks single­
parent students bring a different
perspective about life to the
university community; and their
motivation for school is far
different.
“Most of us had to grow up
pretty quick in order to handle the
pressure and responsibility of

having children and getting an
education. We bring a lot to
student life,” Laidlaw said.
Suggestions of an alliance
between single parents, campus
organizations, family residence
assistants
and
University
Housing were also discussed.
But the problem of leadership
and genuine interest of the
campus community was the
concern. In order for parents,
organizations and departments to
unite, leadership is needed. Most
parents do not have time to start
or maintain such and alliance.
“I think we basically need a
network of friends and family. I
consider myself lucky to have
such a support group. But some
parents are without that sort of
group,” Christy Kagy, senior and
single parent, said.

Commentary On: Crisis in Washington----------------------------------------------------

Impeachment requires overwhelming political support
The first time I heard about
Bill Clinton was when he gave a
long rambling speech at the 1988
Democratic convention. The
speech was a disaster. Still, he
persisted toward the national
office. The next time I heard
about him was during the early
part of the 1992 presidential
primary season. I saw a national
TV news report about Governor
Clinton addressing people of
various interest groups at a large
hotel. Clinton moved from suite
to suite addressing issues. After
the governor left, the people he
had
addressed
generally
approved of his performance and
thought that he was going to do
something specific to meet their
needs. The people in some suites
had opposing political views to
people in other suites. I thought
that if Governor Clinton had
promised to do something for all
of these people, he could not
have been telling the truth to at
least half of them. That was the
moment that Bill Clinton lost my
confidence.
Since then, Bill Clinton has
had a lot of explaining to do. He
has had to explain why he did not
serve in the military, did he

smoke marijuana, what happened
during his land deal known as
Whitewater, and how come a
large number of women say that
he has had more than friendly
relationships with him.
I had not been amused by
explanations from the “lovable
rogue.” The national news media,
for the most part, has accepted
them. That is until the story of
Monica Lewinsky hit the
television screen. After five years
in office the press and the public
have heard so many stories and
seen
so
many
slippery
explanations, they have come to
believe that charges of having sex
with a 21-year-old and then
covering it up could be true. It
would seem to be the nature of
the man.
I do not know what the truth
is in this case. I’m not sure any of
us will know for sure. Even if
accusations are true, the president
will never admit to this affair.
There is a long public record of
waiting until the last possible
second
before
providing
information
requested
by
committees of Congress by the
courts. These delays have often
led people to believe there is

more to a story than if the
information had been fully
explained
early
on.
The
administration blames others.
Mrs. Clinton charges that the
Lewinsky affair is part of a rightwing plot to undo the results of
her husband’s two elections.
James Carville attacks the
prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, saying
he is a tool of the right.
If asked to guess about the
president’s future, I would say
that he will complete his term in
office. This assumes that there is
no hard evidence of a coverup.
The public has repeatedly stated
that Mr. Clinton’s sexual affairs
have no bearing on his ability to
operate the levers of government.
If, on the other hand, there is hard
evidence of a coverup or other
criminal behavior, the president
should resign or be removed.
In the absence of hard
evidence, Bill Clinton will not
resign. Even if prominent senior
Democrats come to his office (as
happened
between
senior
Republicans and Richard Nixon
in 1974) and ask him to resign for
the good of the party and of the
country, he will not. I believe that
Bill Clinton would rather pull

down his party than to admit to
wrongdoing. He does not seem
very much invested in his party
with the exception of getting A1
Gore elected as the next
Democrat in the White House.
If
the
House
of
Representatives were to vote a
Bill of Impeachment, what are
the chances of getting 67 votes
for conviction in the Senate? Of
the 100 members, 45 are
Democrats. That means all 55
Republicans and 12 Democrats
must vote to convict. Without
that hard evidence which I
referred to earlier, the Senate
would be very reluctant to push
out a president.
Some pundits say that the
Democrats might be eager to rid
themselves of the political
problems which Bill Clinton
brings to the 1998 elections.
Other
assert
that
some
Republican senators might want
to keep a weak democrat in
office. Sixty-seven are a lot of
votes. The Constitution makes it
very difficult to remove a
president.
The
writers
of
the
Constitution were aware of how
in European politics, political

leaders were deposed because the
opposition disagreed with a
political agenda. Usually that
change was accomplished by
force of arms. Our founders did
not want that sort of instability in
our
governmental
process.
Change was to come from the
ballot
box.
Impeachment
deliberately
required
overwhelmingly political support
during a political crisis. Without
overwhelming political support
the results of a presidential
election
should
not
be
overturned.
Most of the time I have
disagreed with the policy
initiatives of this president. Yet,
he has been elected twice and is
the president. If I want a different
political agenda, then it is up to
me to elect a president who
represents my views. It is wrong
to rely on impeachment and
conviction, which may be
another form of coup d ’ etat.
This is America, not Europe.
Let’s act like Americans.

One month isn’t enough time for an entire history of a people
A month, twenty-eight days
is the time allotted to make up for
the entire history of a people.
Then to add insult to injury, it’s
isolated, taught and thought of
only at this one point in the year,
never to be spoken of again till
next year.
In high school, I took a
European studies course. It took
at least a semester to get through
the
Black
plague
and
Charlemagne, but Black history
takes only a month.
Many have argued the
relevance of this month. Some
have asked why there should be a
Black history month. And I agree,

there should be no such thing as a
Black history month. Black
history is part of American
history and what is watered down
and condensed into a month
should have been brought up and
taught during the entire year.
Most people think of
African-American history and
want to isolate it, and label it as
“revisionist history.” American
history is painted differently with
African-Americans showing up
sometime just before the Civil
War, then disappearing and being
reintroduced again with Martin
Luther King, Jr., and the Civil
Rights movement.

Now one could suggest that
blacks weren’t doing anything in
between reconstruction and the

The type of things that are left out
are things like “Amistad.” Issues
brought up in the movie
“Amistad” left many viewers
wondering, “why have I never
heard of that?”
Though trains of thought
have changed in education, the
mind-set that African-Americans
are not a part of American history
often at times has not. In many
cases, people have to go to
college to learn some of the bits
and pieces that have been left out

and take specialized history
courses. Some never leam the
full extent of our American
heritage.
Charlemagne did not come
to rule Europe in a day. History
can not be condensed into a
month. History is far too vast a
subject, too in-depth to be
trivialized to a mere month. If our
country discussed the second

we could never do justice to an

our society. The backs of AfricanAmericans helped to contribute

Supreme Court upholds hispanic district in Chicago
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Supreme
Court Monday upheld a predominantly
Hispanic congressional district in Chicago,
rejecting a voter’s claim that race was
improperly taken into account in drawing
the district’s boundaries.
Illinois’ 4th Congressional District,
represented by Democratic Rep. Luis
Gutierrez, was drawn in 1991 by a threejudge federal court that said it was needed
to prevent the dilution of the Hispanic vote
and to protect nearby black-dominated
districts.
“I’m delighted - ecstatic,” Gutierrez
said in a telephone interview. “This has
been a good day.”
The nation’s high court voted 6-3 to
affirm a lower court ruling that turned
down James R. King’s 1995 challenge of
the district. Justices Antonin Scalia,

Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence
Thomas dissented, voting to hear
arguments in the case.
The district was drawn after state
lawmakers had failed to create their own
plan after the 1990 census. With a 59
percent Hispanic voting-age population, it
is shaped like a “C ,” running from one
Hispanic-dominated area of Chicago
through the western suburbs and back to
another part of the city with a large
Hispanic population.
In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled that
congressional districts designed to help
racial minorities might violate white
voters’ rights. But in King’s lawsuit, a
federal court ruled the 4th District was
necessary to avoid a violation of the
federal Voting Rights Act.
Last year, the Supreme Court threw out

voting districts in Texas and North
Carolina, making it harder to draw districts
aimed at boosting minority voters’ clout.
The highest court also told the court in
Illinois to restudy the 4th District case in
light of those rulings.
The lower court again upheld the
district, saying it met the strictest level of
legal scrutiny.
In the appeal acted on today, King’s
lawyers said the district had an “obviously
bizarre shape” and was a “patently
offensive racial gerrymander.”
Lawyers for the Mexican-American
Legal Defense and Education Fund and
others who supported the district said the
lower court properly ruled that the district
was justified because Hispanic candidates
had been unable to win in non-Hispanic
districts. The Clinton administration

supported the district as drawn, saying its
shape was based on the traditional political
goal of protecting neighboring districts.
Gutierrez said his district is different
from those the Supreme Court struck down
mainly because it was created and
affirmed by a court before it was
challenged. And he said the message the
high court’s decision sends to Hispanic
voters is an important one.
“It says that we have common interests,
common bonds, regardless of our country
of origin ... and that we face a common
barrier of discrimination,” he said.
“But no one should jump up and down
and think this is a guarantee of anything.
This is an opportunity.”
The case is King vs. State Board of
Elections, 97-743.

Britain ready to act against Irag
but not to overthrow Saddam
LONDON (AP) — Britain is
ready to act against Iraq if
necessary but military strikes
would not be aimed at ousting
Saddam
Hussein,
Defense
Secretary George Robertson said
Sunday.

LYONS, N.Y. (AP) - A
popular high school teacher
found guilty of inappropriately
touching a 16-year-old student
was fined $30,000 but reinstated
to his job after nearly a year’s
suspension.
Robert Bloomer, 50, will
return to the classroom in two
weeks but will be subject to
special restrictions, notably being
barred from spending time alone
with any female student on
school property.
An arbitrator for the state
Education Department found
Bloomer guilty on 12 of 13
charges, including nibbing his
hands up the student’s thigh and
touching her chest and buttocks
on separate occasions almost a

year ago.
He also attempted to contact
her and her family after being
ordered not to by the school
superintendent in this village 33
miles east of Rochester.
Arbitrator James McDonnell
said in a ruling delivered to the
school district Thursday that
Bloomer’s
behavior
was
“dangerous,
unacceptable,
unprofessional and, I might add,
stupid.”
The arbitrator said he was
reluctant to dismiss him, noting
Bloomer “has served the school
well in his 27-year career.” The
ruling is binding on the school
district and cannot be appealed.
The student’s mother said her
daughter
was
receiving

counseling.
The
mother
expressed dismay and added that
the family has not decided yet
whether to pursue criminal
charges.
Bloomer, who earned $55,287
a year, was suspended with pay
last February. He taught global
studies and an elective class in
law, was an assistant football
coach and an adviser to the
student newspaper.
Jean Bloomer defended her
husband as a teacher “who goes
the extra mile for his kids,”
saying in Saturday’s edition of
the Rochester Democrat and
Chronicle that “he is not a sexual
predator.”

Virginia Christian school principal
investigated in paddling of student
STERLING, Va. (AP) — Authorities are
investigating whether a religious school principal
took a corporal punishment policy too far when she
allegedly spanked a 5-year-old girl with a tabletennis paddle.
Loudoun County sheriff’s deputies seized a
wooden paddle Wednesday from the office of Faith
Christian School principal Lynn Kuitems.
Police began investigating after the girl’s father
noticed a large bruise on his daughter’s buttocks
while bathing her Tuesday. The girl said Ms.
Kuitems spanked her seven times with a wooden
paddle, according to a Circuit Court affidavit.
Court documents indicate Ms. Kuitems struck
the kindergartner Jan. 22 because the girl refused to
join a game and was disrespectful.
No criminal charges have been filed.

Robert Showers, an attorney for the school, said
the parents had given written permission for school
officials to physically discipline the girl.
Showers said officials at the 500-student school
“believe corporal punishment is biblical and that, in
the appropriate circumstances, has an educational
benefit.”
But sheriff’s deputies and a Child Protective
Services worker who examined the girl found that
" th e injury far exceeded corporal punishment ...
this was a case of assault and battery,” the affidavit
said.
Loudoun County prosecutor Robert D. Anderson
said corporal punishment is prohibited in Virginia
public schools, with exceptions that allow an
employee to use force to stop a disturbance or keep
students safe.

Flooding in Kenya causes mass destruction
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) —
Kenyan police closed the main
highway in eastern Africa for the
second time in as many weeks
after a bridge
collapsed,
newspapers reported Sunday.
The bridge near Kibwezi, a

town about 180 kilometers 112
miles) southeast of Nairobi,
collapsed Saturday due to heavy
floods, the Sunday Nation
newspaper said.
The highway from the Indian
Ocean port of Mombasa, serves

Kenya,
northern
Tanzania,
Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi,
eastern Congo and southern
Sudan.
The newspaper said army
engineers and employees of the
government
Public
Works

Department were erecting a
temporary bridge for light
vehicles.
On Jan. 16, the highway was
closed for a few days after
another bridge collapsed, also
due to floods.

Unusually heavy rains since
October have killed more than
100 people countrywide and
caused massive damages to
property and crops.

Chicago professor sues CIA over peter pan documents
CHICAGO (AP) — Maria de los Angeles Torres was a
6-year-old clutching a doll when she was shipped from
her parents in Havana to Miami in 1961 as part of a U.S.
airlift known as Operation Pedro Pan.
Operation Pedro Pan forced about 14,000 boys and girls
like Torres to grow up overnight.
“What I remember was just a lot of confusion. ... It
probably made me much more independent but it also
makes you more vulnerable,” Torres said.
Many had never been on an airplane, never seen the
United States, and didn’t know whether they’d ever see
their parents again.
Some, Torres says, never did.
“This program aimed at saving children from
Communism ended up separating families,” said Torres,
42, a professor at Chicago’s DePaul University who
recently filed a lawsuit against the CIA seeking
information about the airlift.
The largest exodus of children in the Western
Hemisphere started with a U.S. State Department phone
call to a Miami priest just before Christmas 1960.
At the time, rumors of Communist indoctrination
flooded Cuba. Parents feared the "patria potestad” — a
law drafted by the revolutionary government to transfer
control of the country’s children from parents to
government officials — and heard word from the
underground that there was a way to get their kids to the
United States.
The U.S. State Department enlisted Rev. Bryan Walsh,

then director of Catholic Charities of Miami, to accept
responsibility for 200 Cuban children granted visas to
come to the U.S. He thought that airlift would be it for the
government’s “noble experiment.”
But then the State Department decided to waive the
visa requirement for 6- to 16-year-olds. And the children
kept coming. About 14,000 arrived between 1960 and
1962, wearing nametags to identify them to the adults
meeting them at the airport — many of whom were
strangers.
Torres and about 6,000 other children were relatively
lucky. They were reunited with their parents within a few
months.
But on Oct. 22, 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis hit,
closing the door between Havana and Miami.
About 8,000 unclaimed children were housed in
crowded camps in Florida before being shipped to
orphanages, boarding schools, foster homes and schools
for delinquent children across the country.
There, some of the Pedro Pans say, they endured a
multitude of horrors, including physical and sexual abuse.
Years turned into decades as those children waited to
be reunited with their parents, Torres says.
Torres, now a political science professor writing a book
on the operation, filed a Freedom of Information lawsuit
against the CIA Jan. 12 seeking policy papers,
congressional testimony, internal notes and anything else
that will help put to rest the personal and academic
questions that have dogged her for nearly four decades.

“'I ’ve received information from INS, the FBI, the
State Department,” Torres said from the living room of
her apartment on Chicago’s north side. “The only ones
who've flat-out refused is the C IA .... I’ve pulled a million
political strings. This was the last resort.”
CIA spokesman Tom Crispell would not comment
other than to say, " a search of our records found no
relevant documents.”
The CIA has until Feb. 12 to respond to Torres’ lawsuit.
Walsh, now 67, disagrees with the negative
impressions of Operation Pedro Pan.
“Every child that we had in care was in a licensed child
welfare agency, supervised by social workers,” he said.
“Some of them had adjustment problems. ... But the
alternative was much worse. The alternative was growing
up in a Godless society where parents were afraid to teach
them anything about God. That was the alternative.”
It is still unclear whether Operation Pedro Pan was
solely a humanitarian effort or a calculated plot to
destabilize Cuba — or, as Torres suggests, maybe it was a
little bit of both.
It’s the answer to that question and many others that
she hopes to uncover in the CIA files.
“Maybe it tugs at something very deep they’re afraid of
unleashing,” she said. “There’s a culture of secrecy at the
CIA. Unless they’re pressured into releasing the
documents, they won’t do it.”

AMPHITHEATER
from page 1
Although many residents are
opposed to he amphitheater, there
are those who think it is a good
idea.
Barb
Pizzini,
Edwardsville/Glen
Carbon
chamber of commerce board
member, said she feels like there
are definite plus sides to the
project, such as a growth in
Edwardsville economy due to
visitors the amphitheater will
attract.
The noise issue surrounding
the proposition, in Pizzini’s
opinion, should not be a concern.
“Technology has changed a
lot in twenty years,” Pizzini said.
“During the sound test if you
walked behind the speakers you
could talk and be heard with no
problem, and since the speakers
would be pointing towards the
refineries any noise would be
lost.”
Pizzini feels that drug and
alcohol use should not be such a
concern either. The types of
shows that the amphitheater
would have would be geared
toward the age group of about 30
- 50. “They are remembering a

different

Pizzini said about
residents of Poag

Often
symptoms
of
depression include withdrawal,
loss of pleasure, feelings of
sadness, and physical discomfort.
Millions of Americans suffer
from depression each
year. No one is immune to
depression, the elderly, middle
aged, young adults, married
couples, adolescents, children
and women can be affected.
Women are twice as likely as men
to be diagnosed with depression
due to biological differences or a
greater willingness to express
feelings.
Depression, if left
untreated, may lead a person to
consider and carry out suicide.
Gloria Walker, a counselor at
the
university
counseling
services, said that the most
common reason for depression on
a college campus is due to stress.
“Some students feel stress
because they have a difficult
time adjusting to a new
environment. Some students new
to a college setting may miss
their parents and friends,” Walker
said.
Walker said that there are
many misconceptions about

depression.
“Many people think that they
won’t get it, or that they can get
over depression without any help.
Some people experience just a
blue funk that may or may not
necessarily be depression but it is
always good to seek out
counseling if the feelings
persist.”
An initial visit to counseling
services would include a
Depression Screening Inventory,
which consists of 20 questions.
A sample of some of the
questions are: How do you feel
in the morning?
Do you
experience crying spells? Are you
experiencing drastic changes in
sleeping patterns? Are you
experiencing rapid weight loss?
Are you experiencing irritability?
How is your ability to enjoy life?
Are you experiencing suicidal
thoughts?
There are various causes of
depression. An imbalance in
brain chemistry may play a role
in some causes of depression;
negative and positive events can
trigger depression; alcohol and
drugs, family history, illness and

certain medications can have side
effects much like the symptoms
of depression.
Common types of depression
are Major Depression, Seasonal
Affective
Disorder
(SAD),
Dysthmia and Manic Depressive
Illness.
There is help for depression in
the form of individual counseling,
group therapy, psychoanalysis, and
antidepressants. In the case of
severe depression where other
treatments have failed, ECT
(electroconvulsive therapy) may
be used.
Depression does not have to
ruin your life. There is hope for a
brighter day. Fully 80-90% of
depressed people recover once
they reach through their isolation
and seek treatment.
Students experiencing bouts
of depression, or know someone
who is suffering from depression,
should seek out professional
counselors, concerned family
members, a close friend or a
member of the clergy. Help is just
a phone call away. On campus,
contact Counseling Services at
ext 2197.

a national convention leadership
award. It was so much fun,”
Ammann said.
Ammann, who has a 4.0
grade point average, has some
very definite goals for her future.
“I would like to be a biology
professor at a Christian college,
and maybe married with a couple
of kids,” Ammann said.
Although she has had great

academic success, Ammann has
not taken any of it for granted. “I
attribute my success to Jesus
Christ, who is my savior. Because
of Him, I’ve become such a
loving and forgiving person. I
feel that God has given me
intelligence and I should use it to
the best of my ability. I try to be
the best I can be in whatever I
do,” Ammann said.

Hip-hop euphoria at the Galaxy

■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
cstulce@siue.edu
I hate to complain, but I will. I
hate feeling guilty for drunkenly
making out with someone at a
party. What is the big deal?
I think we put way too much
emphasis on physical pleasure
being confined to people who are
dating or married.
Why?
By nature, we are drawn to
each other. Why does there need
to be a relationship requirement
to receive this sort of pleasure?
By now, many of you probably
think I’m a nut, and that I’m
condoning cheating. I’m not.
Cheating can put a big damper on
a relationship.
I don’t think people should
cheat. I do think cheating needs to
be more clearly defined. Is
hugging someone else cheating?
Is kissing? Oral sex? Ask
different people and you will get
a different answer. Even our
commander in chief would agree
with that. If cheating is clearly
defined before a relationship gets
roaring, there will be a lot less
fighting on Jerry Springer.
My personal philosohy is: if
you feel comfortable touching
someone, kissing someone, etc.,
and it is consentsual, go for it.
I would much rather go to a
movie with someone I find
attractive and put my arm on their
leg. Why should I be confined to
my seat? I like the warm feel of
human contact.
I don’t date everyone I go to a
movie with and wouldn’t want to
for that matter. But, that doesn’t
mean I’m not curious or wouldn’t
partake in some physicality with
them.
I guess I agree with the theory
of free love, but that whole
disease thing puts a damper on it.
Trust me, someday when the
world is free of all bacteria and
such there will be a lot more legtouching at the movies.

Did I forget to mention that Rahzel can
rhyme? He dropped a gem during the latter
part of Common’s segment, making the
crowd anticipate his solo effort which is due
out after Root's fourth LP this summer.
For all non-believers of Rahzel's ability
and talent, he said “Ain’t no machines ding
this; this coming straight from me.”

watching that the men of the X-Ecutioners
(formery known as the X-Men) strive for
nothing less than perfection.
The X-Ecutioners are a four man team of
veteran deejays: Total Eclipse, Roc Raider,
Mr. Sinista, and Rob Swift.
There is only one thing that could
substitute for hearing them on wax, and that's
to see their live performance.
The X-Ecutioners stage performance is
mind-blowing. The four man team packed
routines that dazzled even the hardest to
please. These brothers made overnight
deejays realize that the art of spinning is hard
to learn.
The four man team handled the wheels
with a vengance. These brothers cut it up with

heir noses, elbows, stomachs and
backs. They did impressive
moves with perfect coordination
and timing, such as: behind the
back, under the leg, over their
heads and scratching backwards.
After The X-Ecutioners left
the crowd in awe as the
anticipation for Common grew
enormously.
The stage crew quickly
prepared the stage for the main
attraction, as a deejay spun a few
tunes to keep the crowd patient.
The scene was a hip-hop utopia.
The club was packed, people of
all colors came out to support
true artists, good sounds and best
of all, peace and love.
Along with DJ Mr. Sinista,
Common’s band wasted no time
setting up taheir equipment. All
eyes at this point were focused on
the band doing quick sound
checks, and hoping to get a
glimpse of the man of the hour.
The band began to unleash
funky grooves that set the mood
and got the crowd amped. As
Common hit the stage, he did his
own rendition of the chorus from
Boogie Down Productions’
classic joint, “JIMMY.” When
the crowd began to recognize it,
heads got open while chanting,
“The C, the O, the M, the M, the
After welcoming the crowd to
“Hotel
Comm,”
Common
proceeded
to
bless
the
microphone with classic gems
from his debut LP “Can I Borrow
A Dollar?”, his sophomore effort
“Resurrection,” as well as his
latest release, “One Day It Will
All Make Sense . . . ”
The crowd was pleading to
hear their favorites all night, and
whether they got them or not,
there wasn’t a dull face to be
found.
Unlike a lot of so called MCs
nowadays, Common knows how

to rock a show. As stated in the
introduction from “One Day It
Will All Make Sense . .
Common injects his whole being
into both his music. Which was in

A l e s i l e

turn displayed in his stage
performance. Relying on his
skill, charm and wit, Common
dismissed that “I'm too cool”
disease that infects the minds of
many of today’s MCs, and brings
it with everything his mind, body,
and soul permits.
Giving St. Louis a top-notch
performance, Common honored
the Gateway City with a first time
performance
of
his
metaphorically
laced
gem
“Watermelon.” “That was our
first time ever performing that”,
said Common.
One of the show’s highlights,
was when Mr. Sinista brought in
the introduction of the now
infamous “The B*tch In You.”
The crowd got so amped until
Common slowed our roll by not
even performing it. Common
proceeded to explain that he
couldn’t do that song. “It's too
many brothers who died over this
sh*t. It’s time out for all of that.”
Supporting Common’s decision,
the crowd offered its applause.
But on the same token, Common
let heads know, “I said what I had
to say, and now that's over; but let
that be a warning to every MG,
that if you step to me wrong, you
will catch a verbal slashing.”
When
Common
began
describing to the audience a
female that he was once cool
with, but is now too high post to

get down everyone prepared
themselves for his classic “I Used
to Love H.E.R.,” which gives the
entire evolution of hip-hop in
under four minutes. As he
proceeded into the first verse of
the song, everyone began singing
along. Everyone exemplified his
passion for this “female,” for she
had done us all wrong (at least all
the true heads out there).
Common
blessed
the
microphone with the phattest
freestyle I ever heard performed
live. It ranged from telling us
where he eats when he’s at
Laclede’s Landing, to pointing
out some broad’s hair weeve.
Common ripped it, leaving those
who weren’t his fans admitting,
“That was pretty phat. What's the
name of his sh*t ?”
Common’s performance was
simply: Off The Hook. His
routines were not only phat, but
each one was performed with
expertise and down pat. There
weren’t any flaws to be found.
Incorporating à live band with a
phenomenal deejay, Common
gave a performance that anyone
could enjoy. No magic tricks. No
gimmicks. Just a whole lot of
Common Sense was given to the
audience. Who could ask for
anything more ?

Q: How common is Common? A: Not very.
William Tate spoke to the artist Common before a show in Vail, Colorado

Common a t the Galaxy on Sunday
January 25.

First of all, how’s
the album doing ?
It’s been doing real
well. It’s almost gold.
Are heads back
home
(Chicago)
giving you the Ps
you deserve now ?
Cause I remember
back in high school,
a lot people would
talk trash and say
you weren’t holding
it down.
Naw, it ain’t really
like that no more.
Brothers started [to]
recognize that I had
talent and that I was
knockin’ at the door
and wasn’t budging
for no one. So they
had to let a brotha’ in.
A lot of Chicago
artists go out west,
east, or down south
when they want to
get a deal and for
business purposes.
Why did you stay in
Chi?
Well, I had to take a
lot of things into
consideration, you
know ? I mean I got
family there. I can go
to New York to take

care of whatever, whenever I have to. But I try to stay grounded and
away from all that industry hoopla.
Has Relativity been giving you the support you need for this LP?
Yeah, much love.
Some of your rawest sh*t be like two and a half minutes long.
Joints like “Communism,” “Invocation,” and “Hungry.” Is that
a Comm Sense thing or do you do it on purpose to leave heads
anticipating more?
Naw, I don’t be planning for it to come out like that (laugh). It’s how
I’m feeling at that moment.
Heads everywhere are lovin’ the video for “Retrospect for
Life.”How was it working with the lovely N’Bushe Wright?
Awww, man, she’s beautiful.
Ain’t she though.
There were a few times I was thinking “Lets end the shoot, so I can
do my thing !” (laugh) You know ?
Don’t I know !!!! (laugh)
Yeah, she’s real cool.
I saw you rock it at the Galaxy on Sunday in St. Louis. Man, it
was off the hook.
You liked it ?
No doubt man, that sh*t was so phat.
You ol’ boy from the other night?
Yeah.
Oh, okay. Yeah thanks a lot man, I really appreciate it.
Who influences your stage performances ?
Oh man let me s e e .......... Michael Jackson (laugh). New cats like
D’Angelo, Maxwell, and Erykah Badu. Yeah they get down.
Yeah no doubt. What are your favorite cities to perform in and
who has the hypest crowds ?
Man, San Francisco, Toronto. Where else ? I like Atlanta, New York,
and Detroit is real live too.
I didn’t hear you mention Chi.
Yeah, its like Chicago be wishy-washy sometimes. They can give it
up for everybody else, but not for their homeboy. But that show at
the House of Blues was phat. That was one of my best shows. I can't
front, I did like that show in St. Louis.

‘Deep Rising’ sinks quickly
NEW YORK (AP) Hollywood loves to crossbreed
and produce film hybrids only a mother could
love.
The latest is Stephen Sommers' "Deep Rising,"
a movie that mates "The Beast" (Peter Benchley's
tale of a monster killer squid) and "Assault on a
Queen” (Frank Sinatra's caper about an ocean liner
heist).
The result is a half-baked idea about a giant
octopus with a very bad attitude and a bunch of
mercenaries who plan to rob the safe of a new
high-tech cruise ship whose owner wants to scuttle
it for the insurance payoff.
And to make sure you know it's "an action
movie," there are enough explosions to shatter a
continent.
The action unfolds amid a storm in the South
China Sea, where the Saipan with its cargo of
armed torpedoes speeds toward the Argonautica, a
cruise ship making its maiden voyage.
Piloting the Saipan is John Finnegan (Treat
Williams), a fast-talking, cheeky hustler who asks
no questions when he charters his boat, and his
mechanic Pantucci (Kevin J. O'Connor), a wacky
geek with a smart mouth, and first mate Leila (Una
Damon), who's dispensed with pretty early on.
Their passengers are six thugs led by Wes Studi
(who should fire his agent for putting him in this
dud). With an assist from someone already on
board the Argonautica, they plan to take over the
ship and make off with millions.
Meanwhile, passengers enjoy a night of
celebration aboard the Argonautica: dancing,
entertainment, gambling, tons of food and
champagne. And a jewel thief with the improbable
name of Trillian (Famke Janssen) attempts to
break into the vault and steal whatever she can.

But someone on board (it doesn't take too much
brain mileage to figure out exactly who) tampers
with the ship's computer and shuts down the
vessel. Dead in the water, it's easy prey for
creatures of the deep who swim from the sea's
bottom and crash into the hull.
With special effects reminiscent of "The
Poseidon Adventure," people, furniture, food,
fixtures all tumble together in deadly confusion.
But by the time the Saipan arrives _ its own hull
damaged from running over a lifeboat _ no one
seems to be on board. Just blood. Lots and lots of
blood.
There are three survivors: Trillian, the Captain
(Derrick O'Connor) and Canton (Anthony Heald),
the ship's owner.
One by one, as is the formula for this sort of
thing, the bad guys are picked off by octopus
creatures, and Finnegan and friends frantically try
to save their own lives.
To the credit of the filmmakers, what little
suspense there is is heightened by not showing the
creatures too early in the movie. But so much of
the action and horror is predictable, silly and
purely gratuitous.
There is a cute ending, but not cute enough to
make you glad you saw the movie.
Given the material (the script was written by
Sommers) the cast does an able job. Williams is
properly glib, O'Connor adds a sometimes forced
comic relief, Heald provides the usual smarmy and
untrustworthy character he does so well, and Studi
is intense. Djimon Hounsou, who won critical
acclaim for his portrayal of the kidnapped African
Cinque in Stephen Spielberg's "Amistad," has a bit
part as a mercenary. He, too, should fire his agent.
"Deep Rising" is a Hollywood Pictures release.

Phoenix neighborhood
has become an urban zoo
PHOENIX
(AP)
The
neighborhood around the Palo
Verde Golf Course has horse
privileges, but residents didn't
stop there. Parts have become a
sort of urban zoo.
“I have chickens. I have a
rooster. The lady on 15th Avenue
has pot-belly pigs, several
donkeys, a rooster, sheep," says
resident Heather Brodhurst as she
walks through a neighbor's yard,
patting the dusty burros and
talking to some geese.
Such
is
life
in
this
neighborhood, a place that
maintains a rural character scarce
in the heart of one of the fastestgrowing cities in the country.
Soon, that character could be
even more scarce. The burros and
geese could be living next to a
community of villas, two to four
stories high, with concierge
service, housekeeping, 24-hour
security, a health and tennis club,
and
a
14,000-square-foot
conference center.
Some say that neighborhood
charm may be in danger.
“It's like a little utopia in a
huge metropolitan area. ... The
rural character is slowly being
eaten up," Brodhurst said,
stroking the nose of one of her
horses. “When is enough
enough?"
The
neighborhood
is
mobilizing to fight a plan to build
about 900 suites and golf villas at
the center of the Palo Verde
course in north-central Phoenix.
A neighborhood meeting drew
400 to 500 people.
The rezoning application is
scheduled to be heard by the
area's village planning committee
in about a month, and eventually
by
the
city's
Planning
Commission and the City
Council.
City Councilman Phil Gordon,
who grew up in the area and now
represents it, has said that he
would abide by his constituents'
wishes.

“If the community doesn't
want this project, I am solidly
with the community. Period. No
issue," Gordon said.
The brewing issue has the
threads of a development-vs.preservation debate, but there's
also a deeper conflict: the
challenge of redeveloping older
parts of the city while trying to
retain
the
established
neighborhoods' character.
Brodhurst and her neighbors
understand the landowner wants
to sell the course and an adjacent
farm, owned by the family for
decades. They know there is
residential zoning under the
course, but that zoning is for
about one home per acre, and
they don't want that to change so
drastically.
“I wouldn't even mind if they
cut it down to half-acre lots," says
Don Tamuty, who has lived in the
neighborhood for 22 years.
In the proposal by Gray
Development Co. of Phoenix, the
900 units would be built across
the street from homes with a
roster of animals that include a
Shetland pony and a goat.
“I don't even know of anyone
that even says 'Hey, it might be a
good idea,"' Tamuty said.
Gray
Development's
president, Bruce Gray, isn't
surprised. He understands that
when you try to plop a new
project
into
a
semirural
neighborhood
built
predominantly in the 1950s,
you're going to ruffle some
feathers.
His frustration is that people
fight such projects “and then we
all stand back and say as a
community, 'W hy is Phoenix
becoming another LA? Why are
we blading the desert? Why are
the freeways so congested? Why
is the air quality so bad?1"
Everybody pushes in-fill
development, he said, “until it's
in their back yard."

Cougar ice hockey downs two at home
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
A pair of upset wins this past weekend has shown how
much improvement the SIUE ice hockey team has
had this season.
The Cougars came back to down Washington
University on Sunday 7-4, but not before outlasting
Missouri-St. Louis 5-3 on Saturday.
UMSL came out with an aggressive offense and took
the lead 1-0, but SIUE killed off a five-on-three power
play at the end of the first period and took the momentum
into the second period.
Head coach Bill Misiak countered the speed of UMSL
with his cycle support system and SIUE pulled away with
goals from Brad Brussatti and Jeff Rasch.

“We’ve been practicing the cycle support system and it
has really worked for us,” Misiak said. “It’s a system from
the late 60s that the Toronto Maple Leafs used. It’s like
follow the leader. You work it like a spinning triangle
trying to find the open man. With all of the teams playing
systems that are more modem, it is a strategy that works
to our advantage.”
Goaltender Greg Franklin stopped 40 of UMSL’s
43 shots.
Four first period goals for Washington University put
SIUE in an early hole on Sunday.
“After being down 4-1 at the end of the first period, I
told the players that we need to tighten up and stick to our
system,” Misiak said. “When we came out for the second
period, we started scoring left and right.”
SIUE had goals from Rob Maher, Mike Rudy,
Brussatti, Bill Cloin and two from Ben Fulbright.

Tom Hoagland added the seventh goal when he fired a
slap shot from the blue line and found the back of the net.
Misiak wants to see his team continue to play strong on
the defensive end.
“It’s nice to have a lot of two way players on this
squad,” he said.
The Cougars hope to stretch their winning streak to
three games when they face Wheaton this Saturday at the
East Alton Ice Arena at 10 a.m. Fan support would be
appreciated as SIUE battles for a spot in the year-end
tournament starting Feb. 21.
SIUE will try to avenge a 7-4 loss to Wheaton earlier
this season.
“Our team has really come together,” Misiak said.
“There are no standouts on this team, but we support one
another well.”

Everything from injuries to
personal problems have hit the
cougar wrestling squad hard this
season as their record drops to
1-11. The team fell to Missouri,

The Cougars may have
scored better than Central

Missouri State had it not

The weight classes leaving a
void in the Cougar lineup were
118 pounds, 177 pounds, and
heavyweight (HWT). The 118
pound spot will be filled by
sophomore Kevin Dunn. When
Steve Brown recuperates from
an injury, he will wrestle at
heavyweight.
A bright note for the
wrestling team is transfer junior
Jessie Montez. Montez was a
Junior

Runner-up last season for Triton
Junior College in Chicago.
Montez is currently the 126

this season.
Clark didn’t have time to deal

upping her per game average to

Kim Lowe had 15 rebounds and
19 points and another forward
Alicia Harkins, scored 23 points
and fought for nine rebounds.

Men’s basketball lo ses two starte rs to split two game weekend
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Although they were short on players, the SIUE men’s
basketball team was not short on intensity in two Great
Lakes Valley Conference games last weekend.
SIUE went toe to toe with the No. 14 ranked team in
the nation on Thursday, but with two of their top six
scorers out of the line-up, the Cougars came up short to
Southern Indiana 84-74.
SIUE was without a handful of players as they
finished up a four-game road trip. Most notably out for
the Cougars were guard Shaun Smoot, who was out with
the flu, and forward Allen Berry, who is waiting for a
doctor’s release to play after being in a car accident two
weeks ago.
“I felt like we were always one player short with
Shaun out of the line-up,” head coach Jack Margenthaler
said. “We haven’t been playing bad since Allen has been
out, but we lose the depth that he brings to the team.”
The Cougars played against Southern Indiana in the
first half and went into the break down by only one. SIUE
kept putting the pressure on the Screaming Eagles and
had a five point lead with seven minutes to play, but
Southern Indiana came back with a 10-0 run late in the
game and came away with the victory.

“Our players weren’t getting much rest,”
Margenthaler said. “We were moving Tim Holloway and
De’Vale Johnson around to different positions to
compensate for our lack of players. Moving players
around like that changes the team chemistry.”
Nathan Kreke led the Cougars with 18 points and
eight rebounds in a losing effort. Holloway contributed
17 points and five steals while Rusty Sarnes and Travis
Wallbaum each chipped in nine rebounds.
SIUE had Smoot back in the lineup, but again dressed
only eight players for a meeting with arch rival
Quincy on Saturday.
Instead of losing their intensity down the stretch, the
Cougars built on a 38-33 halftime lead to down Quincy
84-76. The win puts SIUE at 13-6 overall and 7-5 in
GLVC play.
“We had our backs against the wall after losing the last
game,” Margenthaler said. “This was a do or die situation
if we wanted to give ourselves a chance for the post
season. We had a great effort from everyone.”
The Cougars shut down the GLVC’s seventh leading
scorer, senior Matt Steffe, but were surprised to see
Quincy’s Ryan Brown have a 28-point night.
“We set out to contain Steffe and we did that, but
Brown had an unbelievable night,” Margenthaler said.
Five players were in double figures for SIUE. Marlin

Clark had 18 points and five assists. Kreke and Holloway
poured in 16 and 15 points respectively and totaled 13
rebounds. Wallbaum added 12 points and seven boards
while Sarnes grabbed 11 boards and pitched in 10 points.
SIUE is currently in fifth place in the conference
standings with six GLVC games left to determine their
post-season plans. The top seven teams go to the
conference tournament starting on Feb. 24.
“We need to play one game at a time,” Margenthaler
said. “We think we can move up in the standings because
we’d like to be seeded better than fifth.”
Two of those six games will be played at the
Vadalabene Center this weekend starting with the No. 1
team in the conference.
Kentucky Wesleyan, the No. 4 ranked team in the
country, will visit SIUE on Thursday evening at 7:30
p.m.
“They’ve got it all,” Margenthaler said. “They can
beat you with their size or their outside shooting. We
need to just play our game and simply do it better than
them.”
On Saturday, SIUE will battle Bellarmine, the GLVC’s
sixth place team, at 7:30 p.m.
“We beat them earlier this year but they’ve improved
since the last game," Margenthaler said.

Kerrigan and Harding meet again in ice-skating rink
NEW YORK (AP) — One is Mickey Mouse, marriage
and motherhood. The other is Penthouse, a pack-a-day and
pickup trucks.
Nancy and Tonya. Tonya and Nancy.
They needed no last names in 1994, when they went
mano-a-mano in the supermarket tabloids and an Olympic
skating rink: America’s sweetheart, Kerrigan, versus
America’s most wanted, Harding.
Back then, when Tonya’s ex-husband conspired to give
his sweetie a gold medal and her rival a broken kneecap,
their soap opera on skates riveted the world. The interest
soon waned, but the two still remain uncomfortably linked
by the brutal attack and its bizarre aftermath.
When they skated at Lillehammer, barely seven
weeks after the Jan. 6 attack on Kerrigan, more than
110 million Americans tuned in; the eighth-largest audience
in TV history.
When they returned home, Kerrigan appeared at Disney
World. Harding appeared in a men’s magazine after her exhusband
peddled
their
explicit
wedding
night video.
In the four years since, Nancy has thrived and Tonya has
survived. Their paths never crossed until recently, when
network cash led to a brief reunion. Yet it remains hard to
think of one without the other: Nancy and Tonya.
There’s Kerrigan, now 28.
She lives in Massachusetts with her husband/agent, Jerry
Solomon, and their 1-year-old son, Matthew. Her
endorsements and professional skating tour appearances
have left the skater financially set for life.
She traveled last year with a big bucks, corporatesponsored collection of world figure skating champions. She
worked herself back into skating shape just four months after
giving
birth,
and
took
her
son
along
for the trip.
Her Olympic memories: A bronze medal from 1992, and
a silver from the tumultuous 1994 Games.
Then there’s Harding, now 27.
The chain-smoking, bottle-blonde dumped Jelf Gillooly,

the not-so-bright “mastermind” behind the Kerrigan attack.
As of last year, she was living in Oregon with her new
boyfriend, his roommate and the roommate’s pet rat. She
returned to the ice one year ago with a two-minute
performance at a minor league hockey game;
fans welcomed her by tossing two collapsible batons
on the ice.
There was a guilty plea for her role in the Kerrigan attack,
with three years probation, $160,000 in fines and 500 hours
of community service. Kerrigan suggested that Harding
“needs help in her head” ; Tonya visited a psychiatrist.
Last February, Harding claimed that she was abducted at
knifepoint outside her home by a “bushy-haired stranger.”
No one was ever arrested in the incident.
Skeptics noted the kidnapping occurred just before her
hockey rink appearance. Harding dismissed the skeptics as
“idiots.”
Her Olympic memories: A broken skate lace and an
eighth place finish. The U.S. Figure Skating Association
quickly stripped Harding of her national title and banned her
from membership for life.
Neither wanted to reflect with The Associated Press about
their lives after Lillehammer. Instead, they will be reunited
for the first time since Norway on Thursday on a joint
television appearance. (Harding has routinely turned down
any interview request not accompanied by a check.)
It will be their first chat since a chance encounter in the
Olympic Village. “Hi. It’s been a tough month for us, huh?”
Kerrigan said at that meeting.
“Yes,” said Harding. They said nothing more.
The Nancy-Tonya flap did more than inexorably link the
pair. It completely redid the sport’s image, an icy equivalent
of the NFL’s breakthrough Baltimore Colts-New York Giants
1958 title game.
Television ratings boomed. Only pro-football now draws
more viewers than skating, and the U.S. Figure Skating
Association recently signed a 10-year, $100 million deal
with ABC.
The sport had long sold the idea of dueling divas - Debi

Thomas and Katarina Witt were portrayed exactly that way
at the 1988 Games. But there was nothing remotely
comparable to the over-hyped February 1994 showdown
between Kerrigan and Harding.
A month before, Kerrigan was wailing “Why me? Why
me?” after the Detroit attack. On Feb. 25, she and Harding
squared off on the ice for a gold medal.
Harding was initially booted from the U.S. team when the
Kerrigan plot became public. But she regained her spot after
threatening the U.S. Olympic Committee with a $25 million
lawsuit and jetted to Norway.
It was a made-for-TV movie, happening live and America
couldn’t get enough. Kerrigan, demure in white, was the
heroine. Harding, garish in red, was the bad gal. Would good
triumph over evil?
Unsung Oksana Baiul of Ukraine won over both of them,
collecting the gold medal. Kerrigan, despite a brilliant
performance, finished second.
With the competition over, the courtroom became the
center of attention.
Gillooly pleaded guilty to racketeering and received a
two-year jail term. After release from prison, he changed his
last name to Stone, remarried and kept a low profile.
Hit man Shane Stant and his uncle, getaway driver
Derrick Smith, received 18 months apiece.
Harding’s part-time bodyguard, 310-pound Shawn
Eckert, received 18 months, too. Eckert figured he’d get rich
running a bodyguard service for frightened figure skaters in
the wake of the Kerrigan attack.
His sentencing judge told Eckert, “There are adjectives
that can be added to your name - something like infamous,
notorious, greedy, dishonest, even stupid.”
Harding avoided jail time and Kerrigan survived her own
minor PR gaffes when she was caught on camera
complaining about a Disney World appearance.
But Kerrigan continues living a virtual fairy
tale; Harding continues living a future Quentin
Tarantino project.

Interim Wolverines coach’s future still uncertain
ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — As the second half of
the Big Ten season gets underway, the question of Brian
Ellerbe’s job status as Michigan’s interim coach is
beginning to heat up.
Ellerbe and Athletic Director Tom Goss have
steadfastly avoided talking about a permanent position.
Despite a two-game losing streak before Sunday’s 8066 victory over No. 16 Iowa, No. 19 Michigan has
exceeded expectations with a 16-6 record and a tie for
fourth place in the Big Ten.
“I continue meeting with Brian once a week and in
that time he’s yet to ask me about this job,” Goss told
The Ann Arbor News.
Ellerbe said, “You know, I’m not even concerned with
that yet. As I’ve said, the best way to get a job is to do
your own job. That’s what I’m trying to do.”
Goss said he was impressed with the job Ellerbe has
done but offered nothing more than to say Ellerbe would
receive an interview when the season is over.
Rumors continue to circulate about other possible
candidates and seemingly everybody but Ellerbe has
weighed in with an opinion on whether he should
keep the job.
He has the support of his two co-captains, Travis
Conlan and Robert Traylor.

NY Giants sign Este s to
three-year contract
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Shawn Estes, a 19-game winner
with the San Francisco Giants
last year, has signed a three-year
contract.
Terms of the deal were not
immediately available.
Estes was 19-5 last season
with a 3.18 ERA in helping the
Giants win the National League
West Division.

fact, Conlan and his teammates still insist that kind of
program was already instituted by Fisher and should
continue under Ellerbe.
“Look where we’re at right now,” Conlan said.
“We’re on the fence of making something great happen.
You can’t ask coach Ellerbe for anything more.”
Traylor, a junior who is likely to opt for the NBA after
this season, said the team is not playing for Ellerbe’s job.
But when he was asked if he would like to see
Ellerbe given permanent status, Traylor replied: “Yeah, I
would, personally.”
One thing working in Ellerbe’s favor is history,
because Michigan has done well by its interim coaches.
Fisher, who took over for Bill Frieder on the eve of the
NCAA tournament, led Michigan to a national title.
In his eight seasons, Fisher guided the
Wolverines to two more appearances in the national
championship game.
Michigan also elevated Lloyd Carr from interim to
permanent football coach when Gary Moeller was let go.
Carr won a national championship in his third season.
And last year, Sue Guevara went from interim to
permanent women’s basketball coach. After taking over
for Trish Roberts, Guevara led the team to its first
winning record in seven years.

“If they’re looking to start a tradition, why not start it
with Brian Ellerbe?” senior Conlan asked after a practice
last week. “You know, it’s all hypocritical with the
university. They’re looking to have a tradition like Duke
or North Carolina. Well, they had that for (eight) years.”
Conlan was referring to former coach Steve Fisher.
Fisher was fired by Goss on Oct. 10, a day after the
results of an investigation into the basketball program
were released.
The results revealed three minor violations of NCAA
rules and questioned Fisher’s role and relationship with
Detroit booster Ed Martin. Goss said he fired Fisher after
the two could not agree on a direction for the future
of the program.
Goss embarked on a two-week nationwide search
after dismissing Fisher but it proved to be a bust. Fisher’s
firing came just days before the official start of practice,
and no coach in the country was willing to leave his
program under those circumstances.
Goss promoted Ellerbe on Oct. 24. But during
the search process, Goss said he would like Michigan
to emulate such great programs as Duke and
North Carolina.
A Michigan athletic official told the newspaper that
those comments rankled both Ellerbe and the players. In

In 201 innings, the left-hander
struck out 181 and walked 100.
“Shawn is one of the finest
young pitchers in baseball
today,” Giants general manager
Brian Sabean said Saturday. “We
think this three-year commitment
by the Giants reflects not only
our appreciation for the great
year he had last season, but also
our optimism about his future.”

Olson signed to minor-league contract
PHOENIX (AP) — The
expansion
Arizona
Diamondbacks signed free-agent
pitcher Gregg Olson to a oneyear, minor-league contract
Saturday and invited him
to spring training as a non­
roster player.
Olson, a 31-year-old right­
hander, has 173 career saves and

a 28-29 lifetime record.
He was 4-3 with one save and
a 3.02 earned run average in 34
relief appearances last season for
Kansas City.
Olson, an All-Star in 1990
with Baltimore, has also pitched
for Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit,
Houston and Minnesota.
“The cliche says that you can

never have too much pitching,”
said Diamondbacks general
manager Joe Garagiola Jr.
“Gregg did an outstanding job as
a set-up man last year for the
Royals and proved there is still
some life in his arm.”
Arizona’s
pitchers
and
catchers begin spring training
Feb. 13 in Tucson.
