With a few good tips, common summer
health problems can be prevented or solved
■ BY BOB FEHRINGER
PHOTO EDITOR

Cut, but a no-no: Taylor Kennedy, age 6, helps
demonstrate summer safety around the
outdoor grill. Children should always be kept
away from barbecue grills.

Now that you’ve finally put away
your snow shovel, turned off the furnace
and opened your windows to let in fresh
air (and smoke from your neighbor’s
barbecue pit), you may want to think
about enjoying your summer, safely.
Chances are that you've heard or
read about how to treat the common
summer related injuries such as sun
bum, heat stroke and shark attacks (hint:
avoid wearing herring scented perfumes
or colognes).
You’ve probably heard a million
times that you should stay away from
the water after eating (this possibly has

roots in the shark attack scare stories).
But is this, or anything mentioned, fact
or myth?
Among the scenarios you probably
have not heard is what to do when a
June bug flies in your ear and won’t
come out. If you enjoy the incessant
buzzing and nibbling on your ear drum,
do nothing. However, if you don’t enjoy
this invasions of your ear space, the
emergency room staff at the St.
Elizatbeth Medical Center in Granite
City would like to offer a few first aid
tips and clear up any misconceptions
about summer safety.
According to Emergency Room
Director of Ambulatory Services Kathy
Gauen, heat stroke is the most serious

hear-related illness.
“It occurs when the body loses the
ability to cool itself,” Gauen said.
“Symptoms include a high body
temperature (106 F or higher), very hot
and dry skin, a rapid and strong pulse
and the victim may be delirious.
“A person with these symptoms
needs immediate medical attention,”
Gauen added.
“Heat exhaustion is a less serious
but still dangerous illness,” she said.
"This happens when a person loses
water and salts through perspiration
and does not replenish them.”

El Nino isn’t to blame for foul Madison County/St. Louis weather
Saint Louis University professor o f meteorology gives answers and advise fo r how to handle these severe weather situations this summer.

m BY MOLLY
MCNAMARA
FOR THE ALESTLE
Recent bouts with severe
weather are common for the
beginning summer months. A
local Saint Louis University
weather expert says the St. Louis
area experiences around 27
tornadoes and even more
thunderstorms annually.
There are two important
factors that create the atmosphere
for thunderstorms and tornadoes,
according to Saint
Louis
University
professor
of
meteorology. Dr. James Moore.
“There are two major
ingredients we [meteorologists]
look for in sever weather," Moore
said. “We look for warm, moist
air at low levels near the surface
of the atmosphere. That produces
an instability, or a parcel of air
that meets no resistance. This
causes warmer air to rise above

the cooler air. We also look for a
wind profile that rotates in a
clockwise
fashion
and
strengthens with height,” says
Moore. These factors usually lead
to severe thunderstorms and
tornadoes.
El Nino has not really played
a role in the sever weather,
Moore says. The rain just seems
more severe because the storms
have been clumped together.
“El Nino is basically waning
right now and the temperatures
are cooling in the Pacific,” says
Moore. “El Nino affected our
winter more than it has our
summer. The southern Gulf Coast
states are more effected by El
Nino
than
the
Midwest,
especially this late in the year,”
he said.
Dr. Moore says that during
severe weather, watches and
warnings are usually confused.
He says a severe weather watch is
used when the conditions are

favorable for a thunderstorm or
tornado, and a severe weather
warning is issued when a tornado
or thunderstorm is eminent.
During a tornado warning,
people in houses or other
buildings need to seek shelter in
basements, bathrooms or closets,
said Moore. People in cars and
mobile homes are in the most
danger during a tornado.
“If you’re in a car, do not try
to out-race the tornado. Many
people have been killed because
they thought they could outrace a
tornado,” Moore said. “It is best
to get out of the car and seek
shelter in a low-lying area...like a
ditch or ravine. People in mobile
homes should do the same.”
While a tornado or other
type of severe storm warning is in
effect, Dr. Moore says it is
important to seek shelter and
remain updated on the weather
situation.

Tornadoes and severe weather have occurred throughout
the Madison County/St. Louis Area this spring and summer.

University of Illinois graduate student dead after bar fight with bouncers
CHAMPAIGN, 111. (AP) — A University of Illinois
graduate student, who authorities say was severely beaten
by bouncers at a bar, has died.
Champaign County Coroner Eldon Quick said Ernest
Seri, 31, went into cardiac arrest after Thursday’s fight at
the Gypsy bar in downtown Champaign. He died Saturday
at Carle Foundation Hospital.
Two Champaign men — Robert Jurkacek, 31, and
Rubin Navarette, 27 — were charged today with firstdegree murder. Champaign County Assistant State’s

Attorney William Gaston said. They had been charged
with aggravated battery before Seri died.
Gaston said Seri and Jurkacek, a Gypsy bouncer,
argued late Thursday night.
Police have not determined who threw the first
punch; but Gaston said Jurkacek kicked and shoved Seri
out of the building and slammed the student’s head against
a brick wall.
Navarette, another bouncer who weighs about
300 pounds, then sat on the 155-pound student,
Gaston said. “He told him if he didn't stay still.

he’d kill him,” Gaston said.
Gypsy co-owner Eric Meyer said it was unclear who
was to blame for the fight.
“Just having a problem of this nature is extremely
uncharacteristic at this establishment,” Meyer said. “Our
staff is trained to avoid such things ... It”s a great shock
for all of us.”
Jurkacek and Navarette were both released on
$50,000 bond.
Seri, from the Ivory Coast in West Africa, was
studying for a doctorate in French.

Police Incidents
Ambulance Call
On June 24, 1998 at 10:55 a.m., police and ambulance responded to
a call on campus where a student who was riding his bike on the bike
trail lost control and fell head first on the pavement. The student was
transported to Anderson Hospital.

Arrest
On June 23,1998 at 2:43 p.m., police charged Montel Mayes, age 27,
of Grafton, with confinement of animals in a motor vehicle. Mayes
left two dogs confined in her car for a prolonged period of time,
exposing them to extreme heat. Mayes was also arrested on an active
warrant from Jersey County for deceptive practices. Mayes was
transported to the Madison County Jail.
Burglary from motor vehicle
On June 4, 1998 at 1:04 p.m., a faculty member reported someone
broke the passenger side window on her car and stole a Motorola
cellular phone. The car was parked at the Alton Dental School. There
are no suspects or witnesses.
DUIAVarrant arrest
On June 24, 1998 at 2:42 a.m., police arrested Antoinette Kimball,
age 30, of Cahokia, for DUI. She was also arrested on an active
felony warrant from Granite City for unlawful possession of a
controlled substance. Kimball was unable to post bond and was
transported to the Madison County Jail.

HEALTH-------------from page 1

According to Gauen, a
person suffering from heat
exhaustion may have pale,
clammy skin and be sweating
profusely. They may be dizzy or
feel tired and weak. They may
also have a headache or cramps,
though their body temperature is
close to normal. Severe cases can
require hospitalization.
Gauen also says that the era
of the golden tan no longer exists,
and she recommends sunscreen
for everyone.
Since summer and water
sports are synonymous, safety in
a liquid environment is near the
top of the list. Gauen suggests
following the American Red
Cross water safety guidelines.
According to American Red
Cross Tri-City Chapter Manager
Ron Streiler, these include:
— Learn to swim.
— Always swim with a
buddy; never swim alone.
— Know your swimming
limits and stay within them.
— Swim in only supervised
areas.
— Obey “No Diving” signs.
— Watch out for the
“dangerous too’s:” too tired,
too cold, too far from safety,
too much sun, too much
strenuous activity.
— Use common sense about
swimming after eating. In
general, you do not have to wait
an hour after eating before you
may safely swim. However, if
you have had a large meal, it is
wise to let digestion get started
before doing strenuous activity
such as swimming.
— Alcohol and swimming
don’t mix.
— Always wear a Coast
Guard-approved life jacket when
boating and fishing.
— Know local weather
conditions and prepare for
electrical storms.
— Know how to prevent,
recognize and respond to
emergencies.
Now that you know more
about water safety than you
probably have ever known
before, let’s focus on what
hazards lie in he backyards and
park lands across America.

Bugs: not he gray and white,
Brooklyn-accented, long-eared
cottontail of Warner Bros, fame,
but loads and loads of biting,
stinging,
sucking,
buzzing,
annoying little critters that fly
down Aunt Martha’s throat just as
she’s yelling for one more burger.
According to Gauen, insect
stings can cause allergic reactions
in many people: “If you get
stung, scrape off the singer with a
fingernail or a credit card,”
Gauen said. “Don’t squeeze the
affected area. Wash with soap and
water, apply a cold compress,
then calamine lotion. Get help
immediately if you are allergic.”
Now that the Tick is a
popular cartoon show we may
forget
that
his
real-life
counterparts
are
not
big
blue crime-fighters, but are
responsible for disease. Gauen
advises that if you find a tic on
your body, remove it by grasping
it with fine-tipped tweezers and
pulling slowly and steadily. Wash
the area with soap and water and
watch for signs of infection.
A few more safety tips
concern keeping food cold to
avoid spoiling, never allowing
children to ride in the back of
pickup trucks and keeping
children away from barbecue
grills and lighter fluid.
If someone is burned, the
American Red Cross advises
following these steps:
1. Stop the burning by
putting out the flames or
removing the victim from the
source of the burn.
2. Cool the burn. Apply large
amounts of cold water (not ice)
immediately.
3. Cover the bum loosely
using dry, sterile dressings or a
clean cloth.
4. Call 911 or your local
emergency number.
OK, so now you know how
to have a safer summer than you
have ever imagined possible, but
still have a few questions. If you
have a burning desire to further
educate yourself in the area of
summer safety or first-aid in
general, stop by St. Elizabeth
Medical Center in Granite City,
go to the Community Health
Information Center and pickup a
free first aid guide, or call
798-3581.

Sex in the eyes of a Letters to the editor
different beholder
All Danielle and Corey
all the time, he thinks not

It didn't mean anything to him
According to a survey done not too long ago that I
saw on a television special one day, 50 percent of
American women lose their virginity to someone they
are "‘in love" with. Only 7 percent of men could say the
same. That is a very telling statistic. It almost confirms
the difference in how women interpret sex from men.
Danielle
Often with most women, sex is hardly ever just
Belton sex. Some women can, but most just can't engage in
causal sex with no feelings towards a person for no reason at all.
That’s always been pretty much a male category. I believe I was in
high school when it dawned on me that most of the guys at my high
school would do it with anybody by any means necessary. And I
watched girl after hopeless, foolish girl chase after these guys and
get burned twice: once for thinking the guy actually had any real
feelings towards her, a second time when they find out he told all of
his friends.
My younger sister in high school witnessed this happen to both
of her former friends as they chased after the popular guys and
football players. The slang term would be to “run a train” on a
person, which means in high school terms to have sex with more
than one member of the football team, in some cases within the same
night. Hers was a slow moving train. One member of the team would
fake interest enough to get her to have sex with him, then dump her
so another member could try the same, and so on and so on. My
sister tried to tell her what was really going on, but she thought she
was popular. Currently her reputation is such that she can’t date boys
in her school district.
Even though, I’m sure some men and women can think of a slew
of names to call her. (For men she’d be a slut; for the ladies she’d be
stupid.) But the bottom line is that all she is is what most young girls
are: confused and messed up. My freshman year at SIUE, 1 watched
girls chase after or get chased by the shameless older men on this
campus, then get discarded like a piece of trash. And the sad thing
that always remains was that these messed up women really thought
these men cared for them. Some were genuinely fooled, and others
just fell for the game and lies in a desire to be loved and accepted.
This all started a long time ago, probably in high school where
guys with raging hormones realized that girls and boys were
different, and that if you told a girl you cared for her (or even worse:
loved her), she’d be more apt to sleep with you. Soon it worked up
to the point where a man could feign interest and the woman would
have sex with them. This is all because women have sex out of love
and men give love to get sex. Sometimes I don’t understand how
some women haven’t yet realized this. There are more female
prostitutes than male ones in the world for a reason. Men are more
capable of sleeping with a woman they could care less about. Sex is
recreation: it’s a stress reliever. Sure, they could do it with someone
they loved and respected, but they haven’t met her or aren’t ready for
that yet. I used to think I'd never have a boyfriend, as I waited for
most of the guys I knew to out grow this “do-everybody” stage they
were going through.
My point is that it's not that men aren’t capable of just doing it
with someone they truly love. Men do that all the time. It’s just that
women must be able to spot the ones that are only playing and the
ones that are serious. Also, it’s important for women not to let the
non-serious ones ruin everything for the serious guy.
I think Pat Benetar said it best: “Love is a battlefield.”

I don’t know about you
folks, but I am sick to death of
reading articles written by
Danielle and Corey. Sure, they
throw in stuff from the
Associated Press, but I can read
that crap in other newspapers. If
you are the only two who are
going to write this summer, at
least stir up some controversy by
insulting the morons in charge of
the College Republicans at SIUE
or, heaven forbid, write about
masturbation again. So I have
decided, for the sake of all
Alestle readers, to write this
letter to the Alestle. I wish I
could say it is a letter to the
editor, but it isn’t. It is an article
just like all of the others, only not
written by Danielle or Corey.
Why don’t you throw in some
variety? Last week I read about
“The Truman Show” in every
paper in the world. Instead, why
don’t you write about Jim
Carrey’s first serious role in a
made-for-TV movie called,
“Doing Time on Maple Drive,” a
very serious movie about a
dysfunctional family directed by
Ken
Olin
(yes
from
“thirtysomething”) starring Jim
Carrey as an alcoholic. Better
performance; no one saw it.
Bottom line: please hire more
writers for the summer, or at least
write some of your articles under
a pseudonym. The four people
that do read the Alestle in the
summertime won’t notice that
everybody writes the same way.
Anybody that does read the
Alestle is a zombie anyway.
Ohhh. Did I strike a nerve? I’m
so sorry. (If you couldn’t tell, that
was sarcasm.)

Carencro police aren’t the
only ones who owe Kevin
Faulk an apology
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP)
— We've heard the story so many
times — Player A beat his wife,
Player B punched a fan, Player C
spit on an official. Bad boys, bad
times, bad news.
Where
once
everyone
glossed over the faults of the
nation’s heroes, now the trend is
to expose every flaw. We’ve
learned that rushing a football
does not make you a good
husband,
batting
fast-balls
doesn’t make you a good person,
and playing big-time basketball
doesn’t make you a good sport.
So when another story crops
up about another athlete getting
in trouble, we shrug and joke and
figure it’s expected. No surprise
that a spoiled star got angry when
he didn’t get his way.
That’s why news of LSU
running back Kevin Faulk being
arrested a couple of Mardi Gras
ago outside a bar sparked general
shaking of heads and rolling of
eyes. What do you expect?
Faulk, a quiet young man
who lacked the easygoing gift
of gab that stands many sports
celebrities in good stead, was
easy enough to see as surly —
someone with a chip on
his shoulder.
“I think the arrest hurt him
because people thought he was a
troublemaker — a guy who
didn’t respect authority,” Jason
Robideaux, Faulk's attorney and
friend, said. “He’s a really nice
guy, but people heard about him
being arrested outside a bar and
got an image of him that was
totally out of character.”
When Faulk entered a pre­
trial program that allowed him to
do community service instead of
time, it was obviously another
player getting special treatment.

How
wrong
those
assumptions were has become
clear since then.
By the time Louisiana’s 3rd
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
this week that Faulk’s arrest was
unlawful, the list of charges that
had been drummed up against
him — everything from failure to
move on, resisting arrest and
battery on a police officer, to
criminal damage to property and
public intimidation — appeared
to be slipshod police work at
best, petty revenge at worst.
As for Faulk, instead of
sullen, he appears to be nothing
more sinister than shy.
Faulk is a hard-working
young man who is on track to
graduate from LSU. He’ll need
another six-hours when school
begins this fall.

more) a week, especially in the
final week, or “tech week” as
they call it, before the debut.
Ideally the costumes should be
finished one week prior to
opening night. However, Smith
and his workers remember
making parasols to be used in the
second act of a play as the first act
was taking place.
Sophomore Sarah Maxfield,
a theater performance major, is
no stranger to the stresses of lastminute alterations. She’s acted in
numerous university and local
productions. But more than that,
she also helped create her
costumes for the Summer
Showbiz ’98 production of
The Music Man, in which she
played Zaneeta Shinn, and for
Brigadoon, in which she will play
Maggie. Maxfield explains that
by being a costumer and an
actress, “I can work on the same
production” in a more involved
way. Many actors and actresses
do artistic double-duty by
crafting in some way the
costumes for themselves and
others. In fact, costuming is a
required area of study for the
technical theater major, according
to Smith.
Smith half-jokes over the
strains of a radio playing West
Side Story that “anyone with a
cheery disposition” can work in
the costume shop. Approximately
11 students work there this
summer, along with two interns
and four faculty members. Devon
Bigger, who will be a freshman at
Webster University, is interning
in the shop this summer. From her
perspective as a stitcher and
dresser, the right costume is
quite important. It “brings out

connections between characters
and feelings,” she said.
Professor J. Calvin Jarrell,
who directed and choreographed
the Summer Showbiz ’98
production of The Music Man,
agrees. Costuming, he says,
“enhances the character, indicates
the time period of the play and
the type of character that
individual is.”
Some actors are able to get
into character through costuming.
Jeff Bulkley, who will be a senior
dance major in the fall, believes
that “until I get the costume, it’s
almost as if the play isn’t real.”
“Performers who look good
perform well,” Kathryn Sharpe,
an assistant in Theater and Dance
and assistant to Smith in the

costume shop, said. “After all,
costuming is about showcasing
the actors.”
For Brigadoon, directed by
Peter Reynolds, many kilts are
being lovingly and carefully
made by hand. Just as their
original makers would have
done, aye!
By now you’re probably
wondering where the costume
shop gets the income to create
such elaborate and historically
accurate
creations.
Smith
explains that some funding comes
from Friends of Theater and
Dance (FOTAD), but most comes
from the University’s SummerArts program. In addition, some
revenue from renting costumes
also helps boost the budget. But,

he maintains that “this summer’s
revenue from plays will pay for
next year’s plays.”
Finally, a costum er’s role
(as the costumers see it) is that of
a silent partner. Maxfield puts it
this way: “As long as a playgoer
is completely immersed in a play
and its characters, the costumer
has done his job.” Sophomore
Stacy Small, who started sewing
when she was eight and is making
a wedding gown for a friend,
agrees that “all the elements in a
play work together, forming a big
support system for the actors.”
Small, who is a stitcher for
Brigadoon, also created all the
hats for The Music Man.
Many
costumers
hope
costuming ultimately takes on a

supporting role. Smith says, “I
hope costuming is taken for
granted ... if an audience doesn’t
notice the clothing, if it doesn’t
detract from the play and the
actors, then I’m pleased.” Smith’s
favorite “oops story” illustrates
why a costume shouldn’t upstage
the actor who wears it. The
costumers had worked for days
beading by hand a beautiful black
dress only to have the audience
gasp in awe at the costume, not
noticing the actress. “You
could’ve lit the stage on fire, and
that audience wouldn’t have
noticed because they had their
eyes fixed on the dress,” Smith
notes. The perfect costume in the
wrong play just doesn’t work.
Costuming comes together with
all the elements of a play to
create what Smith calls “sheer
magic,” and the costumers are
creative wizards with a passion
for fashion.

World Cup cast shadow over Wimbledon
News from the fou l
line
By Todd Spann

With all the talented
players m igrating to
one city, a person can
conclude two things: the
All-Star gam e is coming up
or the M arlins m ade
another trade.

W IM B LED O N , England (A P ) — The
early sum m er sports lull usually leaves
W imbledon as the only show in town.
Not this year.
Even players could get distracted by
soccer’s m onth-long W orld Cup in France.
L ondon’s Sunday Times was a good
example. Its first 10 sports pages — save
for one cricket story — were carpeted with
World Cup coverage. Two lonely tennis
pages followed.
B ritain’s Tim H enm an — the 12th seed
— could get upstaged, too. H enm an’s
opening-round m atch today on C ourt 1

against Jiri Novak of the Czech R epublic
could clash with E ngland’s crucial W orld
Cup gam e against Rom ania in Toulouse.
The loser in that com petition would
be H enm an.
England, which failed to qualify for the
W orld C up four years ago, is grouped with
six o r seven team s behind defending
cham pion Brazil as a favorite to m ake the
July 12 cham pionship game.
E ngland’s soccer hooligans m ade news
last w eekend, setting off riots in M arseille.
T hey’ve been quiet for a few days, but

m ore tro u b le w ould alm ost dim inish
W im bledon’s im portance.
Then th ere’s Scotland. Scotland plays
Morocco on Tuesday, and a victory puts
the Scots in the second round for the first
time in eight tries.
Fortunately for W im bledon schedulers,
its July 5 m en’s final is a rest day for the
World Cup — slipped in betw een the
quarterfinals and semifinals.
H ow ever, the w o m en ’s July 4 final
clashes with two quarterfinals.

Jordan
R um ors are flying that
the Bulls ow nership has
considered M ichael Jordan
in deciding on a new coach.
But unfortunately, D ean
Smith probably w on’t want
to com e out of retirem ent.

It appears th at the NBA
will be locked out, and all
com m unication
dealing
with trades and free agents
will be b a rre d betw een
owners and players.
B ut o f course
the
ongoing rum ors of the Bulls
will still co n tinue, even
though th e ow ners and
players can ’t talk.

Hargrove hesitant picking starter for All-Star game
CLEVELAND
(A P )
C leveland
m an ag er M ike
Hargrove d oesn’t see the point
in picking an A ll-Star pitcher
who can’t pitch in the game.
Hargrove, the A L A ll-Stars’
m anager, said Friday that he
would be reluctant to nam e a
starting pitcher to his roster
who pitches on July 5 — two
days before the gam e at Coors
Field in D enver.
“How can you take a guy
who pitches on S u nday?”
H argrove said. “ You c a n ’t
do that.”
That approach could cause

som e problem s. New Y ork’s
David Cone, a 10-game winner
and four-tim e A ll-Star, would
be scheduled to pitch on July 5.
Texas R an g ers 11-game
w inner R ick H e llin g ’s spot
would com e up on the
same day.
So H argrove m ight have to
m ake an exception, and he left
the door open to do so.
“I would be very hesitant to
take a guy who couldn’t pitch
in the game,” H argrove said.
“T h at’s not to say I wouldn’t.”
The startin g lineups for
the July 7 gam e in D enver will

be an n o u n ced M onday and
Tuesday. M anagers fill out
the 30-man ro ster by picking
the p itch ers and reserves,
subm itting th e ir choices by
6
p.m.
W ednesday.
NL
m anager Jim Leyland has said
starters who pitch July 5 will
not be considered.
“No m atter what you do,
you are going to have people
left off w ho absolutely deserve
to be there,” H argrove said.
H argrove
said
h e ’s
talked with several m anagers
to
g ath er
opinions
on
their players.

H e hinted th at C leveland’s
B artolo Colon, tied for the AL
lead with five com plete games
and two shutouts, was getting
serious consideration.
“I think E R A is probably
the m ost telling stat for
pitchers, even though wins are
im portant,” H argrove said. “If
you have a guy w ho’s 11-2 with
a 5.00 E R A and another guy
w ho’s 7-4 with a 2.53 E R A . you
tell me who deserves to go.”
Colon was 7-4 with a 2.53
E R A before starting against
H ouston on Friday night.

And help make your com m unity safer and better for everyone.
Together, we can prove them wrong by doing som ething right.
