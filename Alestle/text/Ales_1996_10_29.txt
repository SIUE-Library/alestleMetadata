University archivist dies after illness
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
Louisa Bowen, archivist at Lovejoy
Library, died Thursday m orning at
her hom e in St. Louis. She had been
in ill health for several months.
Bowen had been a faculty m em ber
at the library since 1985. She was
widely
recognized
for
her
professional
leadership
as
an
archivist, and served as curator of
manuscripts at SIU C for five years.
“Louisa brought professionalism
and good hum or to everything she did
as the university archivist and head of
R esearch and Special C ollections,”
Jay Starratt, dean of Lovejoy and
Inform ation Services, said. “She was a
faculty m em ber who will be greatly
missed by SIUE students and staff.”
“A university reco m m endation
that the university archives in Lovejoy
Library be nam ed in B owen’s honor
has been approved by C hancellor
Nancy Belck and P resid en t Ted
S anders,”
P rovost
and
Vice
C hancellor of A cadem ic A ffairs
David W erner said.
“Louisa was a wonderful person,

gentle
and
funny.
H er
d eath is a tragic loss for the
university,” W erner said.
C onnie Stam per-C arr, assistant
director of academic advising, was a
good friend of B ow en’s.
“She was a wonderful person, very
good at her job, sm art and funny.
E ven though she was som ew hat
rem oved from the students in her job,
she liked them and always wanted
them to do well,” Stam per-C arr said.
She added that Bowen kept her
spirits up throughout her illness. “She
was a source of inspiration for m e,”
she said.
A native of D etro it, Bowen
received h er b a c h elo r’s degree in
English at Skidm ore C ollege and
com plete a m aster’s degree in library
science at Wayne State University and
a second m aster’s in history at New
York University.
She is survived by her husband,
Paul A nderson, and three children,
Eli, B en and Joey.
A campus m em orial service will be
held tom orrow at 2 p.m. in the
library auditorium .

S tudents at the R esidence Hall
have grown accustom ed to the fire
alarm s going off at all hours, but this
time it was for real.
A t 7:30 p.m. M onday two pum pers
and a rescue truck sped up to the
Residence Hall with lights flashing
and sirens wailing as once again the
hall was evacuated after the smell of
gas was detected on 3-West.
L akendra M offett, a freshm an
resident, alerted the front desk when
she sm elled gas, and the resid en t
assistant called the fire departm ent.
“We located the gas leak in a
malfunctioning hot-w ater boiler and
shut off the pow er source. A back-up
unit will provide hot w ater until the
boiler can be repaired,” Larry Best,
acting captain of the Edwardsville Fire

“W e’ve had som e problem s, but

Freshm an Devon Broom field said
that she was getting ready to eat when
the alarm went off.
“We have our coats, jogging pants
and shoes laid out on our desk at night
so we can get ready to leave if the
alarm goes off,” she added.

State and L ocal__________________
Southern Illinois University at Carbondale students riot

southern California, Sunday, killing one person and forcing
neighborhoods closest to a 600-acre fire, to evacuate. The fires raced
through San Bernardino and Riverside counties, about 60 miles east of
Los Angeles. The neighborhoods were saved when winds shifted after
the fires were within a quarter-mile of the homes.
Firefighters kept a close watch for flare-ups in previously burned
areas after winds gusted to 35 mph. Nearly 40,000 acres have burned
in the week-old series of fires.

Officials deny coup attempt by army
AP — Gen. Mohammed Sanousi Ahmed denied reports Sunday that
the army tried to topple the Islamic-oriented government of President
Omar el-Bashir of Sudan. The official military spokesman said reports
of a coup attem pt were unfounded and “circulated by those who don’t
want to see stability in Sudan”.
Egypt’s Middle East News Agency said Saturday that at least 10
army colonels were arrested for plotting to overthrow el-Bashir. It was
the third report of a coup attempt in Sudan this year. The country’s
economy is in a shambles, in part, because of its 13-year civil war.

AP — Hundreds of SIUC students broke store windows and
threw rocks, bricks and bottles at police in what is turning
out to be traditional pre-Halloween revelry. Police Chief
Don Strom said at least 27 people were arrested, a night after
three people were arrested during a smaller riot.
Four police officers were injured in the three-hour fracas
early Sunday and the windows of eight businesses were
broken, but there were no reports of looting. Early Saturday,
party-goers had torn down street signs and destroyed
barricades in a 90-minute melee.
About 2,000 people stampeded through the streets in
1994, overturning two cars and breaking several windows on
the portion of U.S. 51 known as “The Strip”. Police made
more than 100 arrests that year.

letter to the editor___________________________________________________

Remember while you’re celebrating with
your families the reason for the season
As we are quickly approaching the holiday season, I just thought I’d send a friendly rem inder
to my fellow students here at SIU E. Thanksgiving is a time to be with family and eat a hearty
meal, usually turkey and dressing along with various other foods which have been prepared by a
parent, spouse o r friend. C hristm as is a time to give gifts as an expression of love, or m aybe just
to let that special person know that you’re thinking of him or her, and that they’re not alone. Very
often during Christm as we go out, spend lots of money, even run up our charge cards, and spend
the following year getting ourselves out of debt.
Well, friends, I ’d like to rem ind you of the “real” reason both these holidays are celebrated.
It’s a time to give thanks to the almighty creator, “Jesus”. I realize that there are many different
religions in which the nam e may differ; however, the reason is the same. Let us rem em ber to take
a m om ent to give thanks to Him who has brought us thus far. Thank Him for what H e has already
done and for what H e’s going to do for you.
Being a college student is no easy task and neither is having the will to stay and finish school.
Put self aside for a m om ent and ask yourself, “W hat has H e done for me lately?” Perhaps I can
help by naming a few: H e allowed you to wake up this morning, you have clothes to put on your
back (even if they are not the latest fashion), you have breath or you wouldn’t be reading this
letter, and you’re in college (an opportunity many don’t have) whether you’re a good student or not.
These are just a few im m ediate blessings that don’t really require a lot of thought. Things that
we tend to take for granted. Rem em ber, it takes less than one m inute to say “thank you”.

letter to the editor

‘Take advantage of SIUE’s wealth
of opportunity — get involved’
As students at this university, do we really know where our money goes? Maybe it’s time
for the rem inder that students som etimes get, that jolts their m em ories as to where the drain­
pipes of their wallets lead. We all pay fees in our tuition that get channeled into different facets
of the university. We often view tuition as a lump sum bill with no consideration for where
each dollar goes.
Tuition fees are broken down into various categories such as athletic fees, university center
fees, textbook rental fees, as well as a few others. Unfortunately, these fees are often just
blindly paid (eventually) though we may never actually reap the benefits of utilizing them.
As the old saying goes, “W hat you put into it, is what you get out of it.” So after students
identify where particular fees (such as for the University C enter or Athletics) go, they can then
maximize the potential of their dollar by getting involved in student organizations and
attending student-sponsored events. F or instance, we all helped pay for the recent
Hom ecoming activities sponsored by the Hom ecom ing com m ittee. Also, we are all paying for
upcoming events like Tons of Fun organized by the University Wellness Program and the K.N.B. EFX
Group, Inc. special effects demonstration sponsored by the University Center Board.
I realize that these typical avenues are not always possible for every student due to family
or occupational obligations, but, at the very least, take a walk and see what SIU E provides to
us all — one of the m ost aesthetically pleasing areas in the midwest to receive an education.
I’ve witnessed many students who convince themselves that they do not have the time to
get involved. I’ve also witnessed students who didn’t think they had time until they gave it a
try and found ways to rearrange their schedule to accom m odate. It is a simple fact of life these
days that em ployers scan resum es for extra-curricular activities, and if you don’t have any, you
don ’t have a job either.
Avoid the PCP syndrom e (T hat’s Parking lot-Class-Parking Lot)! Take advantage of
S IU E ’s wealth of opportunity. A t least, go for a walk once in a while and enjoy other things
than just your textbooks, professors and homework. Apathy sucks! (For more information regarding
involvement and events, contact the Kimmel Leadership Center in the University Center.)

Exercise your right
to vote on Nov. 5
W hat does Tuesday, Nov.
5, m ean to you? M aybe you
have a test or a paper due,
perhaps a meeting at work.
W hatever it is, most of you
are probably too busy to be
bothered. In the unfortunate
case that the above is true,
let me let you in on a little
secret, Nov. 5th is the day on
which the G eneral Election
of the U nited States is held.
It truly disturbs me that so
many Americans, especially
college students, choose not to vote.
In the next four years,
m ost of ou r lives will
drastically change. We could
be buying hom es, m aybe
starting or even changing
careers. O ne thing is for
certain, we will be paying
taxes.We do have a right to
decide w here this m oney
goes, but without your vote,
you let someone else speak
for you. Your comments like,

“w hat difference can I
make?” are poor excuses at best.
W omen and m inorities
were forced to fight for their
right to vote, so why is it that
they often do not? Each one
of us has the right to vote,
yet so few actually do.
O ur ancestors fought for
an ideal called dem ocracy
and a country based upon
such. It makes me sick when
A m ericans do not take
advantage of our rights. I
hope that just one person
that reads this will actually
change their mind on Nov. 5.
Everyone of us has a voice,
and for those of you who are
too busy or cannot be
bothered, I never want to
h ear you com plain about
your taxes or your rights,
you had your chance.

“ It felt like a family
gathering,” Julie Arm bruster,
p resid en t o f T R IB E , said
Monday. “I think it turned out
great. E veryone was happy
and seem ed to be having a
good tim e.”
T he crowd moved indoors
Sunday because of rain but
th at didn’t seem to dam pen
anyone’s spirits.
“W e’ve been here only for
15 or 20 m inutes, but we’re
enjoying ourselves,” Traci
S tro d er said, whose son,
B rendan C arpenter, attends
S IU E . She was adm iring
w orry beads being sold by
Sandra and Tom Huddleston.
Nearby, Sam and Glenda
Begay were selling silver and
turquoise jewelry. This was
their first year at SIUE; they
w ere filling in for relatives
who co u ld n ’t atten d . The
Begay’s — he is of the Navaho
tribe, sh e’s a Pueblo — said
they can beat everyone else’s
jewelry prices.
“We spend between $3,200
to $4,500 a m onth on sheet
silver so we can sell our
jewelry at a lower cost. A nd
lately, we’ve been getting our
tu rquoise from China. I t’s
cheaper and a better quality,”
Sam Begay said.

Httfoween safety: the key to <? fun ntfht!

By Angela Jinks
Lifestyle Reporter
Trick o r treating safety is very im portant for all
children to rem em ber during the Halloween season.
Recently, D ennis Plew and Chuck Thom as of the
S IU E campus police, spent the m orning with 2-5
year olds from the E ast St. Louis campus daycare
center. Plew discussed a few basic safety tips with the
children. This was done in an effort to provide
children with useful knowledge during Halloween.
Plew told the children to m ake sure their parents
check any candy before they eat it. A nd that any
candy they receive should be w rapped in the original
wrappers, to be sure it has not been tam pered with.
He also said that children should rem em ber to
n ev er go o u t alone, and it is of the utm ost
im portance they stay in groups. Younger children
should always stay with a parent, guardian or an

older brother or sister.
“D o n ’t go where you don’t know,” Plew said.
H e rem inded them of the im portance of staying in
their own neighborhood so they will not get lost. He
was urging them to stay in an area w here there is a
greater chance they know the people around them.
E ven if they are in neighborhoods they are
familiar with, children should stay with som eone else
at all times, and be sure not to go off alone.
C hildren should not go into anyone’s house
either. This includes neighbors and
people they know. Parents should stay
with their children while they are trick
or treating so they know where the
children are during the night.
C hildren who are going out trick or
treating should not ride a bike. Many
groups of people are out during the
night,and it is easier to have a collision,
possibly resulting in injuries. It is also
difficult for children to ride a bicycle in
a costume. This could also result in an
accident, injuring the rider and others
around him.
C ostum e safety is very im portant for
all children. T here are a few simple
guidelines to follow to keep trick or
treaters safe. The first, is to m ake sure
the costum e fits. If it is too long, the
child can easily trip. If it is too small, it is
difficult for the child to move. If a child
is wearing a mask, the holes should be
big enough to see and breathe through
easily. Face painting is an easy
alternative to wearing a mask, it also

allows m uch m ore freedom for the child in moving
and breathing. The costum e itself should have some
bright colors or reflective tape. This helps with the
child walking around in the dark. In a dark costume,
a trick-or-treater is hard to see and easy to run into
or run over. A costum e with bright or reflective
colors is hard to miss.
H allow een is a fun night for children of all ages.
R em em ber a few tips to keep the children safe so
everyone can have a happy Halloween.

spooky Hick, picks fo r juys md. ghouls
By Corey Stulce
Assistant Lifestyle Editor

If you’re tired of watching “H allow een 2”, “Friday
the 13th” o r “A N ightm are on Elm S treet” for the
um peenth year in a row on H allow een night, here
are a few o ther movie choices that will conjure up
som e frights.
For a great story and nice costumes, check out
“N ightbreed”. It comes from the mind of Clive
B arker, and stars Craig Sheffer as a m an who might
becom e a serial killing beast at night. H e gets killed
and enters a cult of un-dead dem ons who live under
a graveyard. Toss in som e top notch special
effects and D avis C ro n en b erg as a devilishpsychiatrist, and this one will creep out even thedevil w orshiper in the crowd.
Next is G eorge R om ero’s zom bie epic “Day of
the D ead ”. This is R om ero’s third zom bie movie
where a few civilians are trapped in a mall crawling
with the flesh eaters. It is very violent and disturbing,
but R om ero does it with class. Some very funny
“zombies getting knocked around” scenes as well.
The ‘60s had some great wacky slasher films and
one of the best is “G ruesom e Twosom e”. It’s about
an old wom an who has a wig shop, and gets her
m erchandise by trapping young w om en in her
basem ent and having her m entally challenged son,
Rodney, cut off their scalps with an electric knife.

“The H idden” has some great suspense and action.
It stars the always weird Kyle M acLachlan as an
alien posing as an FBI agent, tracking an evil
creature who jum ps from hum an to hum an in
insect form to drain their life force and cause them
to m urder. The giant spider-creature leaving the
h u m an s’ bodies is grossly
entertaining. P art of the
fun
is

seeing a little
girl who is

possessed by the creature go on a crazed rampage.
A very disturbing film recently re-released by

Trom a H om e Video is “Bloodsucking Freaks”. It is a
violent tale of an off-off Broadway show and white
slave trade. Some of the bloody acts include: cutting
off a w om an’s feet from the ankles down,
drilling a hole into a w om an’s head and
inserting a giant drinking straw and a dart
board game played with som eone’s rear-end.
O ne of the most violent, funny and bloody
movies ever m ade is “D ead A live”, a tonguein-cheek m asterpiece from P eter Jackson. It
involves a rabid m onkey who bites a woman,
turning h er into a cannibalistic zombie. The
climax involves a m an wreaking havoc on people
with a lawn mower. Some of the m ost imaginative
ways to see people killed are seen in this movie. Be
sure to get the unrated version for ultim ate gore.
Finally, check out “N ear D ark ”, a rarely seen
vam pire flick from 1987. It features a few members
from the “A liens” cast including Bill Paxton and
Lance H enrikson as a family: of vampires traveling
the country in a van, and sucking the blood out of a
few good oI’ boys. Blood flows aplenty in this one.
O ne of the best scenes involves Paxton slitting a
b ik er’s throat with a razor-tipped boot.
All of these films have the “G orey” seal of
approval, and of course can be found in the local
video store. Besides, any one of these beats hanging
aro u n d in the garden w aiting for “The G reat
Pum pkin” to appear.

Cougars trip up No. 16 Truman State
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E m en’s soccer team was m inus two of
their defensive specialists, but m anaged to upset No.
16-ranked Truman St. on Sunday.
The Cougars knocked off the 4th ranked team in
the region 4-2 at G uelker Field to keep their post
season chances alive.
Sophom ore Jake Ashley dented the net first for
SIU E in the 24th m inute from D arren Snyder who
also assisted on the second goal 11 m inutes later, off
the foot of Jerry Reed.
“We came out on fire in the first half,” head coach
Ed H uneke said. “We were taking a bunch of shots
and playing very aggressive.”
Truman St. came back with a goal three minutes

before half-time to cut the SIU E lead in half.
Jason Maxfield added another SIU E tally in the
70th m inute to give the Cougars another two goal
advantage, but Trum an St. wouldn’t die. They scored
eight minutes later to make it 3-2.
SIU E secured the victory when Mike Novak
scored to put the Cougars up 4-2 with nine minutes
to go.
“We really came through on offense,” H uneke
said. “Novak scored an im portant goal and Steve Van
Dyke played a good game.”
H uneke gives credit to David King and Andy
Peck who filled in for B rett Darby, who suffered an
ankle injury 10 minutes into the contest, and Doug
H artm ann, who had stomach problem s before the
game and did not play.
“King and Peck stepped up for us off the bench,”

H uneke said. “O ur defense did a great job.”
Last Thursday, the Cougars battled G reat Lakes
Valley C onference foe, Missouri-St. Louis to a 2-1
loss.
SIU E struck first when Todd H u n ter put the ball
past the UM SL keeper in the 22nd minute. MissouriSt. Louis tied the contest at the 36 :22 m ark and won
the game on a goal with four m inutes remaining.
“We played well, but came up short,” H uneke
said. “We couldn’t get our shots off. They scored a
very good goal with four m inutes left that was really
unexpected.”
SIU E plays Lewis and W isconsin-Parkside on the
road this w eekend in a couple of im portant GLVC
games.
H uneke said, “These are team s ranked ahead of
us so we need to win to stay in the playoff hunt.”

Soccer deserves
accolades for
great season
Saturday the SIU E w om en’s soccer
team

lost a h e a rtb re a k e r to

the

University of Missouri-St. Louis 2-1 in
the Semi-finals of the GLVC tournament.
The Cougars
w ere ranked No. 2
in the tournam ent
and w ere hoping
for a re-m atch with
No. 1 St. Joseph’s,
who beat them in a
re g u lar
season
gam e ju st before
Todd Spann the tournam ent.
U nfortunately, that
never
happened
and unfortunately the Cougars will
have a tough time getting to post sea­
son after the semi-final exit.
But no m atter what happens at the
very end of this g reat year, the
C ougars have accom plished m any
things that past SIU E w om en’s soccer
team s have not.
For one, the Cougars surpassed an
old record for most wins in a single season.
This 14-win season will go down in the
record books as a very memorable year.
We should also understand that this
was done with just four seniors and
three juniors.
The rest of the team are sopho­
m ores and freshm en. Plus the Cougars
could add to their record num ber of
wins when they finish out the season at
the T.J’s Pizza’s Classic at UM-SL.
A n o th er great accom plishm ent dur­
ing the season was being ranked in the
top five in the Country in Division II soccer.
There hasn’t been a higher ranked
Cougar soccer team since head coach
Brian K orbesm eyer’s been involved as
a SIU E soccer coach.
Korbesm eyer has done a great job
this year with his young squad and I
hate to say this but we are going to
expect big things next year.
But I think that is one expectation
Korbesm eyer will love to have.
Congratulations on a great year.

Volleyball splits two GLVC games
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E volleyball team split their two G reat Lakes
Valley C onference gam es last w eekend by defeating
Quincy and falling to Missouri-St. Louis.
The Cougars needed only 58 m inutes to dispose of
GLVC rival Quincy 15-9,15-5, i 5-2 in Quincy, 111., on Friday.
Sophom ore Michelle Gilman led the Cougars with eight
blocks and 16 kills while hitting .538. As a team , SIU E had
46 kills on 102 attem pts for a .294 hitting percentage.
Christy Sheller was back in action after sitting out last
Tuesday’s m atch because of a sore ankle to lead the
Cougars with 33 assists.
Saturday’s m eeting with UM SL saw a battle of two sec­
ond place team s in their respective divisions of the GLVC.
D espite an evenly played game, the Cougars lost 15-8,
15-10,15-11 to their conference opponent.
Gilm an was the SIU E leader with 14 kills and five
blocks. Aviston’s Julie L itteken hit .308 with 11 kills on

26 attempts.
The loss puts the Cougars at 19-12 on the year with a 93 GLVC mark.
Next up for SIU E is a m atch against St. Francis in
Springfield, 111.
