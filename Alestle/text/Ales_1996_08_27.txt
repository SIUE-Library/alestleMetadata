Minimum wage bill raises students’ pay
Students get .50 increase starting October 1
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
Students will see an increase in their checks in October when the
new minimum wage bill signed by President Bill Clinton last week goes
into effect. The last time minimum wages workers saw an increase was
in 1991 when the wage jumped from $3.35 to $4.25.
The increase is the first of two. A second increase of .40 on Sept. 1,
1997, will bring the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour. When adjusted for
price increases in recent years, the minimum wage had dropped near a
40-year low.
Many Republicans had argued that raising the minimum wage would
destroy entry-level jobs. But the administration had pointed out studies
from California, Texas and New Jersey that showed little or no adverse
effect when state minimum wage levels were edged up.
Marian Smithson, financial aid director, said that the university has
not yet had the chance to sit down and look at what kind of impact the
increase will have on the university, however, she did say that the
impact will cause a roll down effect to each individual department and
that each department will decide if they will change the number of
employees they will hire or the number of hours they will be allowed to
work in order to adjust to the wage increase.
“We have no intention to hire fewer students,” Smithson said. “The
individual departments will determine the number of students they will
be able to hire.”
Students questioned by the Alestle were happy they would be
getting a raise.
Gail Slade, a senior journalism major, said she just started her job at

By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
The first student government
meeting of the fall semester
contained several issues to discuss.
Three vital issues discussed at
Friday’s senate meeting included:
University Housing updates,
student’s reactions to services
provided by MCT buses, and the
problems of OIT (Office of
Information Technology).

University Housing Director
Michael Schultz gave the student
body an update on current
housing problems.

China helping Pakistan build missile factory, says U.S. officials
W ASHINGTON — U.S. Intelligence officials have concluded that
Pakistan is secretly building a medium-range missile factory using
blueprints and equipment supplied by China. The factory is said to be
located in a suburb of the northern city of Rawalpindi, near
Islamabad. It is expected to be capable of producing most of the major
components of a missile modeled after the Chinese-designed M -ll in
about two years.

East St. Louis teachers file ‘intent to strike’
EAST ST. LOUIS — A bout 900 East St. Louis teachers
and other district employees took the first step Sunday
afternoon toward walking out on strike. Teachers have been
working for a year without a contract, “showing their
commitment to students,” according to Everett Stuckey,
president of Local 1220. A n intent to strike means the union
reserves the right to strike after five days. The unions action
won’t interfere with the start of school today.

In defense of the Bible and its teachings
Professor Andris, my letter was meant to
accomplish two goals: to correct Mike Flota’s
misrepresentation of Jesus and his purpose, and to
explain the reasoning behind the Defense of

Education student calls liberals and conservatives to
act together to write letters for alternative medicine
Liberals talk a lot about favoring co-operation,
inclusiveness, diversity and multiculturalism, but
they don’ t want to co-operate with or include
conservatives.
Liberals talk the talk, but don’t walk the walk.
They like to pretend that conservatives are all of
one mind and brainwashed, but I’m proof to the
contrary and and radio talk show will confirm that
we are diverse and independent thinkers.
I, for example, am a pacifist vegetarian opposed
to the death penalty, and I deplore greed and
corruption in our society, which many other
conservatives also deplore.
Liberals talk about avoiding “either/ or”, “black
and white” stereotypical thinking, but they
stereotype us.
So I offer you liberals out there a challenge. Let’s
look for ways we can unite to reduce greed,

There is a maverick medical doctor, Donald
Carrow, on KSD radio , AM 55, each Sunday from 3
till 6 p.m. who answers questions on alternative
health treatments. Dr. Carrow is under attack by the
Florida Board of Medicine, which is trying to get
him off the air, revoke his license and make
alternative health care illegal.
The U.S. Congress also tries to pass laws
occasionally against it and against over-the-counter
products, like vitamin and mineral supplements,
many organizations are motivated as much by greed
as by concern for public welfare and that includes
professions like medicine, law and education.
Part of this is surely related to the “urge of the
dominate” mentality of the male culture, which
reminds one of Dr. Mendelsohn’s book, “Male
Practice”.

The medical organizations prefer to provide
expensive treatments and they feel threatened
when people find cheap alternative treatments or
do self-treatment.
This is why the Clintons’ health care plan was a
bad idea. It would have forced us to choose from a
more limited range of treatments and forced us to
buy health insurance, just as we’re forced to buy car
insurance thanks to the legal profession.
Dr. Carrow asks that concerned people write
angry letters, defending his and others’ freedom of
speech and our freedom to listen. The letters can be
sent to Florida Board of Medicine, P.O. Box 2075,
Floyd, FI 32377. To Your Health!

Concerning questions about MCT, Schultz noted that Bob Vanzo, assistant to the Vice
Chancellor of Administration, is now the liaison between student government and the university.
Student government also announced a new MCT advisory board which will work with the
university to alleviate some of the problems with MCT. Among those on the board includes
Student Body President Christopher Nance, Assistant Vice Chancellor to Administration Bob
Vanzo, a designated MCT representative, and Student Senators Demetre Pegues, Nicole
Watson, and Charmyane White.
Senators continued to tell the body about problems with MCT notably buses being late at
there destinations, crowded buses and no air-conditioning on some buses. Michael Schultz said
that he was aware of a bus driver taking an extended break but the other problems he would
look into.
Kim Black, head of the Telecommunications task force, was unable to make the meeting, thus
delaying her report to the student body. Chris Nance informed the body that Black would make
her presentation at the next student government meeting. However, Vice President James Little
learned that OIT has been working without a budget for a possible seven years.
“When talking to Cheryl Strackeljahn,she said she couldn’t find any old budgets and that Dr.
Levine is working on a new budget. That’s probably why there in debt,” Little said.
Little also said that OIT was looking into the future that every student living on campus
would own their own phone line.
Student government agreed that with OIT not having a budget, questions must be answered
about reasons for increases in phone charges and limited services. The body will reserve action
until word from the telecommunications task force.

Trash talkin' and garbage ¿rabbin’
By Danette Watt/Assistant News Editor
Melissa Mills/Lifestyle Editor
Two members of the “Alestle” staff decided to get
down and dirty before the fall semester started. They
got trashed. No, they didn’t get crude and lewd and
dance on bar tables with lampshades on their heads.
Instead, they decided to get even a little more
grimier than that. They scavenged through
Edwardsville dumpsters—the art otherwise known
as “dumpster diving.” Now this isn’t your everyday
type of art. This art requires a lot of preparation and
sometimes even some practice. But most of all it
requires a long shower when you’re done diving.
Although these dumpster diving divas didn’t find
any lampshades during their garbage escapade, they
did find some other interesting things. And the things
they found were quite surprising and sometimes
even a little stinky.
Before the dumpster diaries are revealed, here
are some garbage facts to be aware of first:
A According to the February 1995 issue of
“American Biology Teacher,” the United
States produces more waste per capita than
any other country in the world.
A The nation’s largest landfill “Fresh Kills” is
located on Staten Island. According to the
April 26,1996 issue of the “Christian
Science Monitor,” this landfill is four times
bigger than Disneyland and can be spotted
from an orbiting space shuttle.
A According to the April 1996 issue of
“Christian Science Monitor,” there are
4,800 landfills in our nation.
A According to the March 1995 issue of
“Environment,” over 500 million tons of
poultry and livestock waste are produced
every year in the United States.
Now to the trash ... Our two garbage pickers
made their dive during the day at the end of July in
Edwarsdville. The weather was, of course, hot and
humid. But that didn’t stop their productive dives.
Their first stop was at a strip mall on Route 159.
Their first find consisted of budding impatiens of
pink and red hues found near a dumpster full of old

fruit and boxes. (Both divers’

dumpster that was full of old
fruit and boxes smelled a little
ripe, but there was a
salvageable
hunk
of
watermelon that was priced at
$2.50. Of course, our divers
didn’t have to pay that price.
But they decided to leave the
watermelon to other, more
hungry divers.
At the same strip mall, our
divers found a bakery dumpster
filled with donuts. They may
have been day-old, but they
sure looked and smelled edible.
Again, however, the divers left

managed to scavenge a pair of sunglasses that, yes,

At the end of the dive, our two dumpster divas
were able to distinguish the type of dumpster they
were near before they actually dove. For example, a
dumpster full of clumps of hair clippings meant
barber shop. Empty oil containers and one wiper
blade (which just happened to fit Mills’ car) meant
car store, specifically Auto Zone. Travel flyers
advertising escorted tours to Mexico meant Travel
Express. And, well, a Chinese food dumpster needs
no explanation.
After the dive and with much garbage to take
home, our divers decided they were hungry. No, they
didn’t go back to the bakery dumpster. They stopped
at a fast food restaurant. Errr, that is, after they
washed their hands, arms and faces.
After the grub, our divas headed for home. But

during this dive.

you were hungry enough.
The divers found nothing interesting in the DMV
dumpster. Right next to that one, though, was a
dumpster containing packaged “flyer” toys. That
made sense since it was right in back of a toy store
next to the DMV. But there was just one drawback.
That dumpster was locked.
Speaking of locks, the dumpsters in the Kriege
Hardware parking lot were locked, too. What ever
could that hardware store be hiding? Well, our divers
didn’t find out. So they just walked several feet to
the Stagger Inn dumpster where they found empty
beer bottles and lots of cigarette butts. Nothing
interesting there.
Near the end of the dive, our divers did manage to
rummage up a Christmas tree in the Edwardsville
Senior Center dumpster. But they couldn’t have
gotten the tree without the help of Watt’s dive stick,
which she managed to rummage out of the same
dumpster. The dive stick is one of the essential tools
of the seasoned dumpster diver. Not to mention
good deodorant, sturdy shoes and grubby clothes
that can and will get dirty. So, back to the tree.
Needless to say, the “Alestle” office won’t have to
worry about going to get another tree this holiday

private property, if it’s fenced off, then it isn’t a
public area,” Cooper said.
On the other hand, Shelley, who was the on-duty
radio dispatcher for the Edwardsville Police
Department Monday morning, said that “It is illegal.
Stores don’t want you on their propert\ ”
According to Larry Giroux, senior division general
manager of Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc., the whole
issue goes down to the fact that a diver is on private
property.
“W henever you're on private property, the
property owner is liable—no m atter what.”
Giroux also said that if a dumpster diver happens
to get hurt while rummaging through trash, then the
property owner could be held liable. He added that
dumpsters surrounded by a fence of some sort
should not be rummaged through as the fence is
there for a reason.

“I would assume that would fall under a
trespassing legality,” Giroux said.

CD Review
“We Have Ways of Making You Laugh”
Paul Krassner
This comical CD is definitely worth the cash.
“We Have Ways of Making You Laugh” is a
riot performed by a comedian on a mission. His
mission? To make you laugh. And you will.
Loudly.
The material on the CD was recorded during
a live performance by Paul Krassner in Santa
Monica at the end. of 1995. But don’t worry; all
the material is current. There’s nothing old.
And there’s nothing left out. Krassner just
about covers it all.
Krassner envelopes all realms of politics,
news, people in the news (like O.J. Simpson, the
Clintons, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols,
who are suspects in the Oklahoma City
bombing), families, pornography, religion,
drugs, death, memorials and celebrities with his
witty humor.

Perhaps his most
memorable joke is
the one about how he
tells whether or not
he’s dreaming. He
just flaps his arms
and if he’s dreaming,
then he can fly. If he
can’t fly, then
whatever situation
he’s in just happens
to be real. And
Krassner is almost an
expert in getting into
weird situations.
For example, he
describes a time
when he is stopped
by the police in L.A.
while
walking.

who I am.”
Feeling that he just made an enemy
out of the L.A. police officer, Krassner
decides to pull out a newspaper
clipping with an ad for an appearance
he is scheduled to make. W hat he
forgets, though, is that the picture is of
him mooning the audience. A fter a
left-brain/right-brain battle, Krassner
just can’t pass up the opportunity and
decides to offer the clipping as proof of
just who he is.
The hilarious par t of the whole
scenario (although the whole thing is
pretty funny when Krassner tells it) is
when the policeman looks at the
clipping and looks at Krassner. Then
he asks that question that is just so like
the police: “So, is this really you?” And
the laughs roll from there.
The story about the receipt during his
experience in New York is just as
hilarious. But you’ll have to buy the
CD for that one.
Although Krassner is so funny, a

listener needs to have a certain
amount of awareness when it comes to
current events and people in the news.
Krassner explains some of his
references, but he otherwise is a funny
man without an explanation. So it is
the responsibility of the audience to be
caught up on current issues.
Overall, this CD is a good buy.
Krassner is funny and intelligent, and
he shows both of these qualities in his
material. There is not a lot of swearing
in his material, which is something that
seems to be too prevalent with some of
the comedians of today. There is some
vulgarity, but Krassner even manages
to throw a witty spin on that so that it
is not offensive.
The best material on the whole CD
can be found on the tracks entitled
“Porn Again,” “Three Generations,”
and “O.J. and Oklahoma.” Of course,
though, the rest of the tracks are full of
intelligent and witty humor. And, as
the title suggests, there A R E ways of
making you laugh.

Fresh faces in the
backfield will tell the tale for
the SIUE Women’s Soccer
team this season. The back­
field is comprised of two
returners and seven new­
comers all competing for
starting positions.
Four-year starting
goalkeeper Stephanie Kult
of Granite City, will try to be
the glue that holds her
defense together. The lead­
ing goalkeeper for the past
four years goes into the sea­
son with a total of 347 career
saves. This is 31 saves shy of

the all-time SIUE save mark.
Head coach Brian Korbesmeyer
said, “Stephanie has been one of the
top goalies in the Midwest. She is a
potential All-American. Her leader­
ship and experience is outstanding.”
Korbesmeyer is in his eighth year at
the helm of the team which he said is
the toughest to figure out in terms of
predicting success.
“It’s hard to gauge how good we
will be,” said Korbesmeyer.“It will
depend heavily on how well the back­
field comes together.”
Lynda Bowers of Palmer, Alaska
and Stacy Bundren of St. Louis, will be
the heart of the midfield which looks
to be the Cougar’s strength this sea­
son.
Senior Joan Wacker will also return

to solidify the offensive attack. Wacker
needs only nine assists to her total of
20 to become the all-time leader in
school history.
Roselle’s Shannon Murphy and Jill
Harmon of Edwardsville, along with
Florissant, Missouri’s Kristy Stedman
will see time in the midfield.
“Our midfield is the strongest part
of our team,” said Korbesmeyer.
“Lynda and Stacy have good field
management, and Joan is the hardest
worker on the team. They make our
offense go.”
We have one of the fastest teams
ever this year. With the continued
emergence of our key players and the
development of our backfield, we will
have fit the pieces of the puzzle and
success can only follow.”
