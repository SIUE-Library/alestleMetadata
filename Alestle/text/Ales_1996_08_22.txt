Community policing comes to SIUE
Police Resource Council helps usher in new concept
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
An old concept in police work making its way around the nation
has settled at SIUE.
Community policing—the “cop walking the beat”—is being
revived in police departments around the country as cities look for
innovative ways to fight crime and improve relations with
community members.
Some city police departments are putting officers on bicycles to
give them better access to the community. SIUE began using bike
patrols this fall after university police were awarded a $750,000
federal grant.
Problem-solving is a big part of community policing, said
Suzanne Huebner. Huebner is the public safety counselor for the
University Police.
“Community policing is a philosophy of community partnership.
In the past, police departments have mirrored the community.
There was a lot of interaction. With the advent of the police vehicle,
a lot of that disappeared. You can’t meet the public if you’re
patrolling the streets at 30 mph with the windows up and the
dispatcher’s radio on,” Huebner said.
To help meld the college community, Edwardsville residents and
University police, a Police Resource Council will be set up. The
board will consist of a dozen people. There will be at least one
officer and two representatives from Edwardsville. The remaining
members will come from the campus community of faculty,
students and staff. Christopher Nance, Student Body President,
said most of those will be students.
Nance said an incident at the Cougar Den last spring got him

Phone problem finally getting fixed;
eight-year-old problem will cost SIUE $ 167,500
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
Improperly installed phone lines
are coming back to haunt SIUE
officials. In 1987, Universal
Communications
Systems

Roanoke, Va. lay underground
telephone
cables
throughout

at a cost of $3 million.
It will cost the university another
$167,500 to repair phone cables
that should have lasted “50 or 60
years,” according to Larry Foster.
Foster is the assistant director of
information technology.

These phone cables were buried at

Rudy Wilson, professor in the
School of Education has been
selected as acting assistant provost for
Cultural and Social Diversity.
Rudy Wilson was not among the
three finalists, however. David Werner
wasn’t able to decide on one of the
three and decided that it would be
best to appoint someone from within
the college community.
“I have confidence in Rudy
Wilson. He has been with SIUE for a
long time and is respected on and off

State and Local —
President Clinton signs
minimum wage bill

Obscure cholesterol may cause bad hearts

WASHINGTON — With President Clinton’s signature, minimum
wage will increase by 90 cents. The raise, which will occur over a 13month span, will begin effective Oct. 1 with minimum wage jumping to
$4.75 an hour. The final raise, $5.15 an hour, will take effect on Sept. 1,
1997.
Clinton said the signing of the plan was a cause for celebration for
all American people.

International-----------------------------------------South Korea attempts to end student protest
SEOUL — When a huge force of riot police shattered a nine-day-old
protest by university students, it was backed not only by tear gastossing helicopters but also by public sentiment.
The dramatic police action reflected widespread public anticipation
toward the students, whose protest seemed a throwback to the days of
military rule, and toward their call for reunifying North and South
Korea under the North’s terms.
Pouring down the street at dawn, 5,000 police in gas masks stormed
the six-story Yonsei University building Tuesday, where 2,000 students
were holed up. Thirteen police helicopters dropped tear gas.

CHICAGO — A little known form of “bad” cholesterol
that doctors cannot yet measure reliably may cause early
heart disease just as often as its better-known cousin, a
study suggests.
The lesser-known culprit—called lipoprotein (a)—may
lurk in dangerously high levels in the blood of people whose
other cholesterol levels appear normal on routine tests,
researchers say.
The study by Dr. Andrew G. Bostom, a researcher at the
National Heart Institute, included women, but too few
cases of premature heart disease developed to calculate
their risk from Lp (a), presumably because estrogen
protects premenopausal women from heart disease.
Bostom said it’s too early to do widespread testing for
levels because no standardized screening exists and because
even when the level is known, little can now be done to
modify it. Unlike other kinds of cholesterol, Lp(a) levels
are 95 percent determined by genes, so drugs and changes
in diet have little effect on them.

Campus puritan demands retraction for
Alestle’ s Back to School Survival Guide
The Fourth Estate on campus at times astonishes
me. The Alestle’s new, “Back to School Survival Guide” is a case in point. No doubt well
intentioned and an attempt to be humorous, it is, however filled with Sophomoric, cutesy-pie
advice new students don’t need.
Our Freshpersons are told that “It is OK to skip class,” “Your books can be better used as
table legs,” “Read your books every once in a while,” “You can party till you puke” (did this
editor get us mixed up with SIUC?) and if you are under 21, “Have someone else buy your
beer”—an act considerably more illegal than somewhat. I am sure parents and others who
support this campus politically and economically will be dismayed with and embarrassed
over such infantile advice to incoming students.
Newspeople should be responsible people. Such advice in the “Guide” can undo many
efforts to build academic reputation and mature student life on campus. The editors should
run a retraction and salvage some of their journalistic integrity.
Stanley B. Kimball
Resident Campus Puritan
P.S. Is there some kind of a Kantian Imperitive that some of our loveliest coeds must hand
out condoms during an annual Welcome Week in the Goshen Lounge? How about giving
out bumper stickers reading “Hey Stud, close your fly and open your books!”

If you’re going to criticize, get the facts straight
As Editor in Chief of the Alestle I would
like to formally welcome all of the students
and faculty back to SIUE. Including, Stanley
Kimball, resident campus Puritan.
When I received the letter above by
Kimball I was very excited, after all, any
response good or bad about the Alestle and
my performance is welcomed and encouraged
by the Alestle crew; it means that the
community is reading our publication and we
are doing our jobs.
I did, however, have a problem with some
of what he wrote, not because it was criticism,
but because it was inaccurate. Kimball is
entitled to his opinion, but when arguing, one
must state the examples thoroughly, not
taking it out of context to prove your point.
For example, Kimball quoted a statement I
wrote as “Your books can be better used as
table legs,” but he failed to go on and state
the rest of my sentence, which said, “better
than instructional material, but these classes
are few and far between which means a lot of
reading for you.” I also went on to wrife,
“Know your study habits, form some good
ones early and for your parents sake,
(meaning those who are funding your
academic career), read your book every once
in a while,” (M eaning when you are

required/needed to, to pass your class).
Kimball also quoted me as writing, “ you
can party till you puke,” but he failed to finish
the sentence again which is, “and you can
spend money like it’s water, but remember
youchere for a reason...to get an education.”
The whole reasoning behind my
introduction piece and the advice I gave, was
to tell new students how it really is, ( Which
in reality, you do not have to attend every
class, in fact if you are sick with a contagious
illness, I am certain that no one would want
you to attend. And as far as not reading the
book, some instructors don’t even go by the
book and don’t recommend students using it
either.)
If Kimball didn’t agree with my advice,
then that is his right, but if he is going to
criticize anyone’s opinion, then he needs to
get his facts and his quotes straight.
I would like to thank you Kimball,
however, for reminding me that not everyone
thinks of things the same way and that I
should be more conscious of that.
As far as my journalistic integrity and
printing a retraction, when I write something
that I feel I have compromised my integrity or
ruined my credibility with, that is when I will
print a retraction.

Democracy, not theocracy
Editor’s Note: This letter is in response to a letter written by
Brian Schuetz who was rebutting an article to the editor by
Mike Flota on same sex marriages. This letter in no way reflects
the views o f the Alestle.
This is a brief letter to all the Bible thumpers on campus,
including Brian A. Schuetz. While your using the Bible to
thump the homosexuals, don’t forget to thump the (according
to the Bible) questionable dietary practices of modern
civilization.-Don’t forget to lobby your Congress persons for
the right to polygamy, which was condoned in those times.
Don’t forget to quote the numerous passages that assert that
women and children are the chattel of their husbands. See in
the Bible the obligation to escalate your righteous indignation
into religious wars to be waged on those who don’t agree with
G od’s word.
By all means, thump the advances of modern psychology
and psychiatry as of Satan. D on’t forget to warn people of
using their mind too much, especially their reason. Spread
your anti-intellectual bigotry far and wide.
But while you’re busy warning the righteous minority about
the sinful excesses of the Sodomites, don’t forget one thing.
This is not a theocracy, it is a democracy. You have a right to
your hateful thumping because this is a democracy.
You do not have a right to misuse an archaic book to cede
from me my civil rights. Furthermore, what you are doing to
the Bible dishonors it, ignores hundreds of years of sincere
Biblical exegesis in the light of modern thought, and generally
prevents the love and tolerance that the historical Jesus seems
to have been seeking. You need to upgrade your education.
If God is this hateful (as you propose), then I don’t want
any part of Heaven. But I think your wrong.
By the way, have you ever heard of the term “hate speech”?
If not, reread your letter in light of that concept.
James F. Andris
Associate Professor

Wilson’s main goals are two-fold:
to prepare the class of 2000 for a
diverse work force; and to make
students more aware of and sensitive
to different cultures, races and
religions. He would also like to
extend that to the staff as well,
offering in-service training on diverse
work-force effectiveness.
“We are more alike than different
and it is a good feeling when I can
help students perpetuate more
likeness than hatreds. Because we
cannot live in the past, we must live
for the present and future. It would
be wonderful if students could leave
here prepared for the culturally
diverse world,” Wilson said.
In addition, Wilson said he would
like to be seen as a counselor, hearing
the problems of staff and students
before they take them to higher-ups.

thinking about police and student
relations.
“With the university police way
back in the woods and historically
out of touch with the community,
th ere ’s been a lot of negative
feelings. Our original plan was to
have a police advisory board, but
that has a lot of negative
connotations' for the police
because it implies dictating rules,”
he said.
The goal, he said, is to break
down
stereotypes
and
misconceptions between students
and police. “It’s a multicultural
issue, not a black and white one.
Some international students have
a far different conception of
police from their own country.”
The board’s role will be to meet

to discuss how police can find out
about community resources so
they can pass that information
along to students when necessary.
“As part of the effort to
become much more a part of the
community, one role of the police
officer is to be a resource,” Ken
Neher,
vice-chancellor
for
administration said. “If there’s a
problem at Tower Lake, even
something as minor as a broken
water pipe, police need to know
where to go to get a plumber.”
“It’s a win-win situation,”
H uebner
said.
“Both
the
community and the police need to
give. If we’re going to deal with a
problem in its infancy, we’re going
to have to give police latitude and
resource.”

New bike patrol on the loose
SIUE hires ten more police officers

Traffic A ccid e n t

By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor

On August 11,1996 at 7:54 a.m., police responded
to a traffic accident on South Extention Road.
Timothy Cooper, age 39, of Edwardsville reported
he fell asleep while driving and left the roadway
striking two curbs and a road sign. There were no
reported injuries.

They blend in with the crowd of students
on campus but if you look close, you’ll notice
their holsters. Look harder and you’ll see
their university name tags.
'■
They’re the university’s new bike police.
Suzanne Huebner, University Police
public safety counselor, applied for a threeyear $750,000 federal grant, which made
possible the bike patrol and ten new officers.
“Our department keeps an ear to the
ground for innovative ideas,” Huebner said.
“We knew that Fairview Heights, and
Belleville police had bike patrols.”
SIUE is the first university in Illinois to
receive this grant. “The only other
departments that received this kind of money
was the Chicago Police Department and the
Illinois State Police,” Huebner said.
Bike patrols allow police officers greater
freedom to interact with community
members, an integral aspect of community
policing.
Tom Gain, who’s been with SIUE police
for two years, said police
officers get a lot of negative feelings from the
general public. Community policing rectifies
that.
“In the old style of policing, when you
show up, you’re expected to solve whatever
problem is there. But we can’t always do that.
With the new policing philosophy, resources
are available to us to pass along to the
public.”
Velton Evans, an officer for the past 18
months, said the bike patrol will help with

A rrest
On August 11, 1996 at 7:04 p.m., police arrested
Charles Davis, age 23, of Chicago on two felony
charges, one for home invasion and one for criminal
damage to state supported property. He was also
arrested on a misdemeanor complaint for domestic
battery. Davis was unable to post bond and was
transported to the Madison County jail.
On August 13, 1996 at 12:53 a.m., police
responded to a call to Tower Lake where a party
was in progress. Lili Dong, age 21, of Edwardsville
was arrested for unlawful delivery of alcohol to
minors. Dong posted $100 bond and was released.
Also arrested were Alan Graff, age 19, of
Edwardsville and James Hatcher, age 17, of
Edwardsville for unlawful consumption of alcohol.
Each posted $75 bond and was released.

police relations with the public.
“It’s easier to get on-the-spot feedback. It’s
a concept that’s really needed,” he said.
Gains added, “People are more apt to talk
to you. Students have been stopping us to ask
us about our bikes. All we can tell them is
that it has ‘trek’ written on it.”
Bike police will be using Trek 850
mountain bikes.
Officers went through an intensive fourday training course. Those completing the
course will receive certification through the
International Mountain Bike Association.
By September, there will be 18 officers
certified to be on the bike patrol.
The training the officers received included
learning to ride their mountain bikes up and
down stairs and using it against a criminal.
The bike police will wear downfilled
sweatsuits when the tem perature falls to
about 30 degrees but will switch to patrol cars
when the weather gets too severe.
Gain wants members of the university
community to know that the rash of car
burglaries should be reduced because they
will be more able to zip around the parking
lots looking for suspects.
“We’ll be able to zip in and out of the cars.
They will more apt to be looking for police in
a squad car,” Gain said.
There are currently 27 officers on the
university police force; two more will be
hired soon.
“It’s a really good, diverse group with a
balance between the experienced and the
inexperienced, the older and the younger,”
she said.

Press Release
Vidmark Entertainm ent will be releasing “Hollow Point”
and “Pinocchio’s Revenge” on video in October.
“Hollow Point” will be released on Oct. 22. This R-rated,
action film stars Jonathon Lithgow (“Cliffhanger,” “Pelican
Brief,” and “Cain”), Donald Sutherland (“O utbreak,”
Disclosure,” and “Backdraft”),Tia Carrera (“Rising Sun,’’“True
Lies,” and “Wayne’s W orld”) and Thomas Ian Griffith
(“Excessive Force” and “Crackerjack”).
An international crime syndicate led by Livingston
(Jonathon Lithgow) is on the move in America. Livingston is
planning one last payday for the group before they move their
operation overseas. Only one thing stands in their way: F.B.I.
Agent Norwood (Tia Carrera) and her rival D.E.A. Agent Max
Parish (Thomas Ian Griffith). Their competition to bring
Livingston down and take credit for a multi-million dollar
payday grows so fierce that they constantly cripple each others’
investigation. W hen Livingston’s top assassin (Donald
Sutherland) murders Norwood’s friend, she vows to hunt him
down, but Parish needs the assassin alive to convict Livingston.
Betrayed by his boss, the assassin is looking for his own
revenge. Parish gets to the assassin first and makes a deal:
revenge for the assassin and a payday for the D.E.A.

Effective August 1, 1§96, the Bank
Returned Check Fee (BRC) was
increased from $15 to $25 per BRC.
A BRC is defined as a check which has
been returned from a commercial lending
institution due to insufficient funds.
The revenue currently collected from the
BRC fee is not sufficient to cover all the
costs of coliecting bad checks. This
increase will help shift the cost of BRCs
from all students back to those individu­
als who write bad checks.

Volleyball hits the courts this fall,
to improve from good first season
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
i

A/esf/e/File Photo

The SIUE Volleyball team will be hitting the courts this fall trying to improve
on a 15-15 overall record and a 10-12 mark in the GLVC..

Just two years ago, any volleyball
being played at SIUE was either for
recreation or by club sport only.
Now, by good organization and
preperation, the SIUE athletic depart­
ment brought together a talented varsity
squad that made the GLVC tournament
in its first try.
With that in mind, the Cougars want
to avoid the sophomore ginx, which is
doing worse there second time around
than their first.
But head coach Sandy Montgomery
sees her team focused on improving from
the 15-15 team of last season.
“I’m very happy but not suprised that
we did well last season. We should of
done better but inexperience set in dur­
ing the close games,” Montgomery said,
But now we have some experienced
players returning which will help us play
more consistantly and hopefully get us
back to post season.”
The toughest part of being a first year
team is not having any returning players
to build off of.
This year the Cougars will be bringing

back six players, all with playing experi­
ence.
One of the returning players is sopho­
more Michele Gilman who finished 12th
in the nation for blocks.
“It’s quite an accomplishment espe­
cially for a freshman to come in and do
something like that,” Montgomery said.
With those six returning players,
Mongomery is bringing in what she calls
another good batch of big freshman.
As team goals are concerned,
Montgomery lets her team decide what
they want to accomplish throughout the
season.
But the one main objective is to get to
the tournament again.
One way to get better is to have a
tough and lengthy schedule and this sea­
son the Cougars will be playing some
very fine opponents.
During a tournament down in Florida
the Cougars will be playing the No. 1
team in the nation in Barry University.
Later at home the Cougars will play
Washington Universty, which is the five time Division III champions.
“W e’ve increased the schedule to
make
us
more
competitive,”
Montgomery said.

Frerker brings his running experience into SIUE
Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
Darryl Frerker will return for his
second year as head coach of the
SIUE Cross Country team. He has
been affiliated with the cross country
team since 1990.
Frerker is a native of Highland, 111.
and com peted at Illinois State
U niversity (ISU ) after graduating
from Highland High School.
A t ISU he ran cross country and
everything from 800 meters to 10,000
meters on the track.
In 1988, a year after his graduation,
Frerker began training for the U.S.
Olympic trials in the 1,500 m eter

event.
A fter the trials, he moved back to
the St. Louis area and became a social
service worker for the next two years
and a resident director at McKinley
College for one year.
It was then that he came to SIUE
to start his graduate program in
Physical Education.
Frerker came in as a graduate
assistant to the cross country and
track program.
In the winter of 1991, he ran the
fastest American time in the 1,500
meters which placed him fifth in the
world. He also qualified for the 1992
U.S. Olympic trials in the 1,500 meters
and reached the finals finishing tenth.
A fter completing his graduate

------------------------ degree,
he
became the assis­
tant coach for
SIUE
for the
next two years.
When
the
1994 U.S. Olympic
Festival came to
_______________ the newly
constructed SIUE
stadium, Frerker won the Bronze
medal in the 1,500 meters.
Last year he became the active
head coach in his sixth year with the
program.
This season Frerker is looking to
build a large interest m the cross
country team.
“This year we will have a couple of
the largest (cross country) teams that

we’ve had here,” said Frerker.
He has already doubled the size of
last years women’s program. And the
men’s team has tripled the amount of
runners from last year.
“My philosophy is to have a lot of
inter-squad competition and develop
as a team,” said Frerker.
He has been recruiting players all
year long, but welcomes anyone that
is interested in cross country to come
out for the team.
Frerker said, “If anybody is inter­
ested in the program, all I ask of them
is to be dedicated. If you show up for
practice everyday, I will coach you. I
treat everybody the same no matter
what the ability level. I just want you
to try hard every practice and be ded­
icated.”

Men’s soccer “Moving Forward”
From SIUE Sports Information
It’s natural to want to move forward in soccer. After
all, it’s difficult to win if you don’t move forward and
score.
That’s why llth -y ear coach Ed Huneke is upbeat
about the new season. His Cougars are headed forward to
the Great Lakes Valley Conference, a move which will
bring in some of the Midwest’s best Division II soccer
programs.
Making the move into the GLVC this season will be
perennial rival Quincy University and old nemisis
University of Missouri-St. Louis.
SIUE, 3-13-1 last season, will look t orebound with a
solid foundation of players along with a handful of new­
comers.
The Cougars return three-year starter Darren Snyder,
of Wichita, Kan., as its top forward. Snyer played only a
handful of games before going down with a season-end­
ing injury.

“We’re looking for him to mature into a major con­
tributor and play up to his perceived potential,” Huneke
said.
SIUE adds Steve Van Dyke, a senior transfer from
Eastern Illinois University, at forward. The Collinsville
native’s explosive size and speed can make him a major
impact player.
At midfield, the Cougars will be looking to juniors
Jerry Reed and Rob Thornberry.
Reed, of Springfield, has become a more aggressive
player, and it’s now shown in his playmaking efforts.
Thornberry of Riverton, has shown improvement in his
strength and toughness, key components, notes Huneke,
for their position.
Even though the Cougars are entering a new confer­
ence with UMSL and Quincy, they are not taking any­
thing for granted in the 12-team GLVC.
“I’m sensing it’s going to be a challenge,” Huneke said.
. “We’ll have to be at our best to win.”
SIUE, which plays all 11 of its conference foes en route

Men's soccer will join the GLVC this sea­
son and drop down to Division II.

It's a fact. When you graduate prospective employers look for one thing on
your resume. Experience. While clubs and organizations are nice groups to
join, none of them offer you professional work experience. However, there
is a place on campus which can, the Alestle.
Organized and managed like a professional newspaper, the Alestle can help
you gain the experience you need prior to graduating. And, currently, the
Alestle is accepting applications for Advertising Sales Representatives for the
