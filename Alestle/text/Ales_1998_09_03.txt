Road crews are
taking jolts out
of SIUE roadways
BY ANTHONY WATT
NEWS STRINGER
The road to a college degree is
certain to have some bumps, but at
SIUE crews have been working to
smooth the roadways.
Some of the thoroughfares were
really showing their age before an
extensive repair program got under
way.
Cougar Drive has been repaved
from its intersection with University
Drive to the C ougar Village
apartments. Also, some Cougar Village
parking lots have been resurfaced and
access roads built for the residence
halls. Whiteside Road between Circle
Drive and Bluff Road has also been
refinished.
“Things have gone pretty much as
planned,” Bob Washburn, director of
Facilities Maintenance, said. “We were
able to finish W hiteside Road before
the Jackie Joyner Kersee Invitational
(in late July) to prevent further damage
by the large buses which brought fans
to the event.”
Despite
the
scale o f the
construction projects, Washburn,
Director of Administrative Services
Bob Vanzo and Director of Housing
Mike Schultz agree that the work,
which
affected each of their
departm ents, was com pleted by
deadline and in some cases before the
due date.
Some problem s
did
arise,
however. Poor weather caused delays,
especially during the summer, and
portions of Cougar Drive were so
badly deteriorated that extra work was
required.
Not all the street lights along
Cougar and Tower Lake drives are
working, but Vanzo and Schultz said
they expect them to be on before midSeptember.
The road work has been going on
for quite awhile. Over the last two
years, most of the student parking lots
were resurfaced.
“Project plans started in 1994,”
Vanzo said, “but we needed to get
approval, sell bonds, plan the project,
bid the work and award the contract
before we could begin work.”

Three students relax Wedenesday in the Goshen Lounge o f what will become the Deiyte W. Morris University Center
during Founder’s Day activities next month.

SIUE University Center will be
renamed to honor 'visionary’
BY SETH TREPTOW
NEWS STRINGER
For more than 30 years, the
University Center has served as
a virtual living room for the
campus community. Designed
and financed in part by those

who make the most use of it,
students, faculty and staff, the
UC was officially dedicated
March 3, 1967.
Now the University Center
is being rededicated as the
Deiyte W. M orris University
Center
at
next
m onth’s

Founder’s Day celebration. The
visionary
behind
the
Edwardsville campus, Morris
served as SIU president
between Sept. 10, 1948, and
Aug. 30, 1970. University
archivist Steven Kerber said
that M orris was primarily

responsible for the creation of
this campus.
Students tasted their first
meals in the cafeteria, bowled a
few frames, and enjoyed a
billiards exhibition, on that
1967 day.

To help make a connection
with the community, many rooms
in the building were named for
areas around Edwardsville. The
main lounge was nam ed the
Goshen Lounge because the
pioneers referred to Edwardsville
as the “Land of Goshen” — a
biblical reference to “the land of
milk and honey.” The Meridian
Ballroom is named for the 90th
m eridian that passes through
campus.
Despite two staircases that
led to nothing but walls because
the second floor was not yet
complete, the UC won the total

“He was a visionary and a

managing the grow th o f the
Carbondale campus from a small
college to a large university, he
oversaw the creation and growth
of SIU Edwardsville.
During his tenure, Morris
was the final authority on
decisions in the SIU system.
A ccording to G ayla Bruning,
coordinator of major gifts for the
SIUE Foundation, M orris had
high
aspirations
for
the
Edwardsville campus.
“He was very big on service
and volunteerism . He was
integrating dorms in Carbondale
in the early ’50s which was, at
the time, highly unusual,”

were
encouraged to take over the
vocals on some of their more
popular, heavier songs, such as
“River Runs Red,” “Method of
Groove” and “Other Side of the
River.” Crane often gave up his

cordless mic throughout the set.
Guitarist Joey Z. said that the
band members hope to have a
new album out in M ay ‘99, and
described the new music (the first
of their recordings with Crane on
vocals), as “really heavy.”
Australian
rockers
Grinspoon opened the show with
heavy riffs a la Pantera and
Helmet. They played a mediocre
set that drew only a small
reaction from the crowd.

M orris’ vision helped make
SIUE what it is today. Morris
wanted to m ake education
accessible to everyone, and
Kerber s a id . that is why
Edwardsville was created as a
commuter school.
“The system tries very hard
to make education affordable, in
terms of tuition and the textbook
rental program. In the sense of
making it available to people who
could not otherwise afford to go
to very expensive schools, that’s
still very much in his tradition,”
Kerber said.
Before the construction of
SIUE, and even today, the MetroEast was the most densely
populated area in Illinois outside
of Chicago. However, there were
no
secondary
educational
opportunities for residents of
Madison and St. Clair counties.
Since there were few affordable
colleges within a hundred miles,
and so few area residents
graduated, Morris was able to
turn on his charm and convince
people of the need and feasibility
of a college in the Metro-East,
Bruning said.
M orris
believed
that
education was the best way to
obtain
a
productive
and
prosperous future. Under his
leadership, SIUE has changed
from a small teachers school to a
m ajor university, providing a
great service to the community,
Bruning added.
Since his tenure as university
president, SIUE has begun to
take a turn in a different
direction. W hat was once solely a
commuter school has become

home to more than 2,300 students
in the two residence halls and in
the Cougar Village apartments.
Kerber said M orris would be
pleased with the direction.
“He was very interested in
planning and took pride in
understanding all the issues
and wanted to ensure the totality
of the student experience,”
Kerber said.
With the renam ing of the
University Center, M orris’ efforts
will be further recognized.
Kerber said that the rededication
of the UC for M orris is very
significant since he was involved
with
its
planning
and
construction and was there for
the opening.
“This is an effort to pay
tribute to the tremendous scope
of his contribution, and it is
appropriate
to
nam e
this
building after him at this time,”
Kerber said.
SIUE is dedicating an entire
year to M orris’ contributions. The
Morris Celebration year, will run
from Oct. 15, 1998 to Oct. 16,
1999. Numerous activités have
been chosen as celebration
activities, and the year will kick
off with the UC rededication on
the 15th, with Founder’s Day.
Fifty years after M orris’
inauguration
as
university
president his ideals are being
presented to an entirely new
generation as his dream of SIUE
prospers and grows. As Bruning
said, “he was a visionary, that’s
the word that keeps cropping up,
‘visionary.’
He
saw
the
potential.”

Going to the extreme
Young people take things to extremes. One slice
of pizza isn’t enough anymore; you have to eat the
whole pie. You don’t just fail one class; you fail three.
You can't have one beer; you need to chug a case. And
this attitude spills over into everything.
Danielle
You can’t take 12 hours of courses. You want 18.
Belton
Whoa! OK. let’s think this out for a moment.
There are so many different extremes, from fun to food to studies,
and 1 suffer from that last one.
My name is Danielle Belton, and I’m a chronic overachiever. I
know I'm not the only one. I’m also a procrastinator and I eat too
much, but we’re not talking about me today — this is all about you.
As appealing as some extremes may be, none o f them ever do
anyone well in the long run. Some failed extremes include;
Communism (extrem e libralism), Nazi Germany (extrem e
conservitism). Chris Farley (extreme eating, drugs and drinking),
Jimi Hendrix (extreme drug addiction), Urkel (extreme irritation).
If societies built on extremes can fail, regular, weak human
beings such as us don’t have much of a chance. But with extremes,
you have to acknowledge them at first in order to solve them. That's
the reason why Alcoholics Anonymous makes the members say
their names and admit they’re alcoholics before the healing can
begin. You have to admit that you have a problem. As you can tell,
I don't have a problem with admitting my problem. Solving the
problem is where my troubles come. But like I said, this isn’t about
me — this is about you.
In my two years here at SIUE, I have witnessed many extremes.
Most of them through the many friends and roommates I’ve had
since coming here. (These aren’t their real names, and don't you
dare ask me who these people are.) There were the extreme
marijuana smokers who at one point came to class high. I already
mentioned the girl who lived across the hall from me in Woodland
Hall my freshman year and became the “Hall Lush.” She played
Celine Dion’s “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now” 32 times in a row,
then went out later that night and got plastered. There was the Lilly,
who after investing in a life of sex, drugs and alcohol, started
emitting a strange disgusting odor that was a combination of a
musty smell, weed, beer and dirty old clothes. Angela ran up more
than $3,000 worth of parking tickets at SIUE, just because she
wouldn’t buy that $75 sticker. There was Shelia, who is someone's
mother and was so drunk she fell at a party and knocked her wine
all over another girl’s white blouse. But she assured me, she doesn't
do that all the time.
Then there was this girl who thought it would be real neat to
graduate in three and a half years, work 30 hours a week and take
18 hours a semester. But she's really not worth mentioning.
Of course everyone on that list crashed and burned. The weed
heads flunked out, the Hall Lush no longer attends SIUE, Lilly
keeps a low profile, A ngela's in debt and Shelia is doing fine. I
guess she really does only do that on weekends.
I have also learned a few things. I'm taking fewer hours. Due
to my trying to kill m yself last semester with work, I was sick all the
time and fell asleep in class. But this semester, I’m doing better.
But then again, this is not about me.

Commentary
Gingrich and restraint
are an oxymoron
W ho’d have thought it
would come to this? Newt
Gingrich, speaker o f the U.S.
House and long a take-noprisoners
Republican
firebreather, has emerged as a voice
of restraint when it comes to talk
of impeaching President Clinton.
Gingrich states that impeachment
should begin only if a “pattern of
felonies” is detected and not
because the president made a
“human mistake” with regard to
former W hite House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
Yet Clinton remains under
fire because of his relationship
with Lewinsky — or more
specifically, because of his longdelayed adm ission o f such a
relationship after months of
denials — although his decisive
anti-terrorist action last week
diverted national attention from
his personal problems.
There’s no mistaking that his
admission, coming as it did in a
brief, defiance-tinged speech to
the American people following
his
appearance
before
Independent C ounsel Kenneth
Starr’s grand jury, has wounded
the Clinton presidency.
President C linton is right
when he says there is important
national business to which he
must attend. But he’s wrong if he
believes
his
acknowledged
deception of the American people
with regard to his personal
behavior is something that will
not, or cannot, have an impact on
how well he attends to it.

Bin Laden’s Terrorism

Funding the Arts
Federal funding for the arts
appears assured follow ing the
recent House approval of a $98
million budget for the National
Endowment for the Arts. What a
difference a year makes.
Last year, the National
Endow m ent for the Arts was
targeted for elim ination by
conservative Republicans in the
House, which voted 217-216 to
kill the agency. It survived
through the support o f the Senate
and the White House.
Since then, new rules to limit
funding
for
the
sort
of
controversial projects that have
previously caused the agency the
m ost trouble and a fairer
funding plan have clearly
dim inished opposition to the
arts agency, created in 1965. So,
too, has the appointm ent of
Nashville folklorist William Ivey
as agency head.
The House ... appears to
have accepted a federal role in
arts funding, and, in doing so, has
chosen to pass on the larger
question of whether federal arts
funding is warranted at all.
The House vote says that the
main question regarding the
agency will no longer be whether
it should exist, but how much
public money it should get at
budget time.

In grease, no one can hear you scream...
BY JIM DALTON
LIFESTYLE STR1NGF.R

Warning: You are about to
enter the surrealistic, sadistic,
horrific world o f college life. The
fictionalized account that you are
about read may shock you. These
are the psychotic misadventures
o f our writer, Jim Dalton, as he
lives a student’s life in purgatory.
Descending the hollow steps
of the Commons, I was greeted
by the unm istakable sm ell of
hamburgers.
The
invisible
strands of this sizzling arom a
latched onto me, and pulled me
and my grum bling stom ach
inside the Commons Grill.
A lthough
I was
only
supposed to speak with the staff
for an informational article, the
tantalizing smell convinced me
that I could conduct the interview
only after I had sampled the food.
I’d never eaten at the Commons
Grill, so I didn’t know what to
expect. As I leaned over the
counter, a young man with a
chubby, brown face approached
me. He had a large blue comb
stuck in his Afro. “Can I take
your order?”
“Yeah, I ’ll take a double
cheeseburger with a large fry and
some onion rings.”
“To drink?”
“Umm ... how ‘bout a large
Pepsi.”
“We only serve Coke
products, sir”

“A Coke then.”
“Your number is 13. Go have
a seat and we’ll call your number
when it’s ready.” P ulling my
hand off the counter to go look
for a seat, I noticed it was soaked
with warm grease. Using my pant
leg as a napkin, I wiped the goo
off my hand and took a seat at an
empty table.
A thin wet layer of grease
caused me to slide off my plastic
chair and onto the floor. Luckily,
only a couple a few tables away
w itnessed
my
clum siness.
However, they appeared to be
interested in nothing but each
other, so I w asn’t totally
embarrassed as I scrabbled back
into my seat. Although the place
smelled and looked like your
typical fast-food joint or “greasy
spoon,” something was different.
The place felt like it was heavy or
w eighed down by som ething.
Even the air felt heavy and wet,
which made it difficult to
breathe. It almost seemed like a
thin coat of grease was draped
over the entire place.
“Number 13.” Recognizing
my number, I walked over to the
counter. Twice, I had to grab hold
of the wall to keep from slipping
on the slick, greasy floor.
“Double cheeseburger, fries,
rings and a Coke?” A large
woman said to me as she hovered
over my food. Her face was a pile
o f droopy folds of skin that drew
her head and eyes into an angry
downward glance. On her left

cheek was a nickel-sized mole
with long black hairs that poked
at the air like insect antennae.
“That’s me.” I said taking
my basket of food. The small
plastic basket had wax paper
under the burger and fries, but the
grease still managed to penetrate
it. A steady drip decorated the
floor as I walked/slid back to my
table.
The first bite of the burger
was a juicy explosion of greasy
taste. The hot liquid fat streamed
down my chin as the fried wad of
meat, cheese and bun seemed to
melt in my mouth. The burger’s
bottom bun was a soggy,
saturated m ush of grease. I
scraped the bottom bun off with
my fork. I then tried to eat the rest
of the cheeseburger upside down
with the dry bun on bottom. On
my second bite, a small squirt of
the greasy ooze splashed down
on my lap and formed a small
puddle. It was then that I noticed
the grease I wiped on my pant leg
earlier hadn’t dried. Instead, it
had become a little blob. And it
was pulsating!
No, grease isn’t alive, I told
myself. Quickly, I dismissed this
ridiculous idea and turned my
attention back to my meal.
Before I could take another
bite, I lunged forward to grab my
basket of fries and onion rings.
The basket had nearly floated off
the table. A pool of grease had
leaked from underneath the
basket. Setting my half-eaten

burger on the table, I grabbed the
few napkins I had and vainly
tried to mop up the mess. The
grease devoured the helpless
napkins. They were no longer
paper, but little wads of goo.
By this point, the grease was
nearly spilling over the table and
onto the floor. I’m not exactly
sure why, but I began to panic. I
felt like I had to stop the grease.
A sudden fear took hold of my
entire body. Glancing across the
compact dining area, I looking
for something to aid in my battle.
The couple at the other end still
hadn’t taken notice of me.
“Hey, you two. Can you help
me out?”
“W hat?”
T heir eyes
regretfully looked toward me.
“Do you have some napkins,
a rag, beach towel, anything?” I
said as I took off my shirt and
tried to soak up the grease.
Although it was crazy, a thought
jumped into my mind: The grease
was growing, and it seemed to be
hungry.
With an insulting smirk, the
guy said, “I think there’s some
napkins at the counter.”
He obviously couldn’t sense
the evil power of the grease.
“Damn it! You idiot, I can’t leave
the grease alone.” I must have
either frightened or disturbed the
couple because they hurried out
of the Commons.
By this point, the expanding
grease had soaked through my
shirt and begun to ooze onto my

hands. I rushed to the counter.
The young guy who had taken
my order was dropping a metal
basket of fries in a vat o f boiling
oil. “Hey, I need some help.”
He hadn’t seen me and I
startled him. Turning to look at
me, the comb in his hair fell into
the vat of grease. “Look what you
made me do.”
“I need help. The grease is ...
out of control.” As odd as that
must have sounded, the man
didn’t seemed surprised. His face
was a look of terror, as if he knew
exactly what I meant. He started
to speak, but stopped when the
woman approached. H er huge
bovine figure lumbered over to
us. She first directed her
menacing, wrinkled face toward
the man.
“Get out of here, Martin. This
boy is going to be the grease’s
victim.” With speed that would
have impressed Jackie JoynerKersee, the man bolted through
the kitchen and out the back door.
Directing her gaze at me, the
woman smiled. The long hairs on
her mole began to dance and
twitch. As her pale eyes stared at
me, I became very afraid.
“The grease needs victims.
Tonight that victim is you.” She
grabbed a meat cleaver and
smacked the side of the blade
against her hand, as if daring me
to go out the door past her.
Knowing that the woman would
have no qualms about slicing my
throat, I ran back to my table.

GREASE
from page 4

By this time a large ankledeep pool of grease was vibrating
on the floor. I could feel its evil
power rising and filling the room.
The puddle began to twist and
contort until a softball-sized hole
formed in the center. A horrific
sucking sound rocked the entire
room, and I could feel the grease
on my pants straining toward the
puddle. The grease tore from my
leg and flew into the hole.
I knew what was happening.
Like a giant vacuum, the puddle
was sucking up all the grease
from the air, floors, counters —
from the entire place. Grease
began floating through the air,
sliding on the floor, and crawling
on the walls as it moved to the
hole in the ever-growing blob.
What was a puddle 10 seconds
ago had become an undefined
mass that stood four feet high. I
knew I was to be on its menu.
In a panic, I ran for the door,
but slipped on grease that was
still heading for the towering
blob. I crashed down and
bounced the left side of my face
off the hard tile floor. Trying to
shake off the pain, I dragged
m yself toward the door. The
grease blob had spilt into two
halves, each about six feet high.
I saw that I was cornered.
One blob blocked the door and
the other cut off access to the rest
of the dining area. With each
second, the blobs of greasy death
slid closer to me.
Lying on the ground, a rush
of adrenaline pumped through
my veins. I decided I wouldn’t go
down without a fight.
“Come on, you blobs o f death.
Let’s rock!”

T h e

The two blobs, which were
now right in front o f me, jiggled
up and down as if they were
laughing. In a crazy frenzy, I
wildly swung my fists. A punch
landed squarely on where a face
would have been, but my fist just
sunk into the viscous mass. The
grease was like acid and burned
the flesh from my hand, but I
continued to hopelessly punch.
The blobs splashed down
upon me like a gooey waterfall.
My entire body was engulfed and
the grease was burning my skin. 1
gasped for air but only got a
mouthful of grease. Enclosed in
the greasy ball o f doom, my short
life began to flash before my
eyes.
• I was about to pass out when
an orange glove grabbed my arm.
Suddenly, I was rolling on the
floor. A large man wearing what
looked like a bright orange
spacesuit had pulled me out. He
was accompanied by a group of
people wearing similar suits. As I
coughed up grease, the men
sprayed the deadly blobs with a
white foam.
As the crew blasted the
grease, another man in a red
spacesuit walked over to me. He
motioned for me to stand up. As I
did, I could see the words “SIUE
Grease Patrol” on his suit. In a
blurred flash of speed, the man
jerked his hand up, and I felt a
sharp blow on the side of my
head. The next thing I remember
is waking up by Cougar Lake
sometime the next morning.
I’ve since learned that grease
attacks have happened before.
That’s why the university set up the
patrol. But no one will officially
speak about it, or why SIUE grease
has a life of its own. I do know this,
and I’ll share it with my readers:
Greasy food can kill.

There hasn’t been this much construction since they built the place!” It’s true. The Edwardsville campus
has not seen this much construction in decades. The future Engineering Building is a mud flat across from the Art
& Design Building. The second residence center Prairie Hall, nears completion south of Woodland Hall. Every
parking lot on campus is being redone. All of the sidewalks in the campus core are being replaced or repaired.
Roads have been closed for repair. The smell of paint is prevalent, and rolls of carpet are stored in the hall. As the
result of capital project funding, bonds funds for parking lots and residence halls, and new state funding for
building maintenance the campus sometimes resembles one large construction site. As the local cable company
keeps reminding us, “The inconvenience is temporary, the results long lasting.” The first phase of ADA
improvements and the Myer Arboretum are completed. Sidewalk repairs will be completed within a week and the
parking lot and road work this fall. The Engineering Building will be completed for classes in the Fall of 2000.
The increased maintenance activity will continue indefinitely. Both the increased painting and carpeting
programs are ongoing programs that will continue to have a positive impact on the campus appearance as well as
the work and study environment. Repairs unseen are improving ventilation as well as temperature controls in
many buildings. Other work is reducing the number of roof leaks with a goal of none.
Within the next few weeks you will see new and/or refinished furniture in the lobbies. Sometime in early
fall there will be new roadway directional signs with proper building names. The old abandoned greenhouse will
be removed from the roof of the Science Building this fall. The wall coverings in the Science Auditoriums will
be replaced and the acoustic separation between some classrooms will be improved this year. Additional work that
will be completed this year will install electronic message entry signs at two campus entrances, and additional
work at the Korte Stadium will improve accessibility and functionality. Construction begins on a new darkroom
in the Art & Design Building, a lab for the Nursing program, and new computer labs in Alumni Hall.
Programming has begun to replace/renovate the East St. Louis Center and to renovate and update the
Edwardsville Science Building. These projects both require additional capital funding to complete. That funding
could occur as early as next year for the East St. Louis Center.
Even with all of these improvements, there are still occasional problems with rooms being too hot or cold,
roof leaks, unsatisfactory restrooms, lights out, etc. When you have a problem in any academic building, please
call Work Order Control at ext. 3711 or E-mail us at fmworks@siue.edu. Input from students is encouraged and

RAV£S

BY COREY STULCE
WRITER-AT-LARGE
cstulce@siue.edu

BY SASHA
MASTROIANNI
LIFESTYLE STRINGER

I would like, if I may, to take
this opportunity to speak to the
loyal readers of the this column
and section of The Alestle. Not
to rant, nor to rave, but to assist
me in a quandary.
The first point deals with the
Lifestyle section as a whole. I
would like to expand the
Thursday edition into a complete
entertainment section, something
to kill a few minutes o f lateweek college hell, whether riding
the bus, or hitching a ride with a
guy named Chuckie Manson
back to wherever you lay your
head at night.
The ideas I had were: a)
reviving the horoscopes that
appeared last year; b) adding an
advice column for students with
questions about life, love or
interesting uses for Velveeta; and
c) adding a what’s cool, w hat’s
old-hat section.
I’ve always thought this paper
could use an advice column. I
know I have enough
embarrassing questions to ask
total strangers, so you must, too.
And who’s better than your peers
to shell out cheap cures in 25
words or less?
This would mean input from
readers, which is a lot to ask, I
know. Usually I have to make an
ass of m yself just to convince a
few people to write letters to the
editor.
But this is your paper too. So
if you dig the above ideas, let me
know. And if you think they bite
the big sausage, well, I’d still
like to know. Suggestions as to
how this section can be
improved can be sent directly to
me via my mailbox at the
Alestle, 1167, through e-mail or
in person.
But if you happen to see me
in a bar making out with some
strange drag queen, politely wait
until I’m finished to share your
opinion on the matters at hand.
I’ll be glad to listen.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Only a handful of
movies have captured the excitement and
unique character of the era that created rock
‘n ’ roll. “The Idolmaker” and “The Buddy
Holly Story” come to mind.
But few seem to have told it as well as
Gregory Nava’s new film, a movie that might
seem the least likely candidate to go beyond
its character-driven story and give us insight
into the cultural changes mirrored by music in
the 1950s and 1960s.
“Why Do Fools Fall in Love” is the story
of Frankie Lymon (of Frankie Lymon and the
Teenagers) and the tangled, tragic path his life
took after dazzling success with the title song
and a string of other hits.
The dramatic vehicle is an intriguing true
story. Three women cam e forward after
Lymon’s death, each claiming to be the
rightful widow of the singing star and seeking
royalties on his still popular songs. Each
claim was questionable, and the matter
wound up in a bitterly fought court case. We
meet them at the start of this battle.
Through testimony and flashbacks, we
learn about Lym on’s rise and fall from
superstardom to drug addiction and his
involvements with three beautiful but very
different women.
The female leads, the gorgeous Halle
Berry as singing star Zola Taylor of The
Platters, Vivica A. Fox as a down-on-her-luck
shoplifter and Lela Rochon as a prim school
teacher, turn
in rich,
multi-layered
performances.

played. Fans were excited and
ready to rock. The crowd loved
“I’m the Man,” the fun late ‘80s
heavy metal-rap song known for
its frequent blunders.
The intensity of Anthrax and
the audience during these classics
was reason enough to dub the
tour “Metalfest.”
Newer tunes, such as “Only”
and “Hy Pro G lo,” were
pleasingly heavy
as well.
Although the set was like candy
for longtime fans, the fact that the
band has played the Fox Theatre
on past tours shows that mass
audiences are no longer as
hungry for the type of music
Anthrax is playing.
Life of Agony (LOA), fellow
New Yorkers, got the crowd off
of their bar stools and onto the
floor with their emotional and
aggressive tunes. Although the
band has played in St. Louis three
times in the past year, they have
not yet received the credit they

deserve. Their name may conjure
images of death metal music and
hellish screams, but LOA carries
out a melody very well and writes
intelligent, meaningful songs.
Whitfield Crane, former lead
singer of one-hit wonder Ugly
Kid Joe, joined the band last year
upon the departure of Keith
Caputo, the band’s original
singer. Hard-core fans were leery
of the change, but the band
carried on very well with Crane,
and fans responded accordingly.
He sang in the same fashion as
Caputo, though he refused to sing
certain songs.
Die-hard LOA fans have also
been concerned with LOA’s
progressively
more
mellow
albums. The first full-length
album, “River Runs Red" was
very heavy with less melody than
the next two.

Say What!?!
What was the best practical joke you
ever played on someone?
"We were havin' a party at my
boyfriend's house, and he
wasn't home. He was at work,
and so he decided to, like call
us and pretend that he was his
neighbor. And, like we had,
like the radio down and
everything. And he was, like
threatening us with calling the
cops and stuff. And we didn't
know it until later, like an hour
after he got home, that it was
him. He had one of the guys
that he worked with call. And
we were, like all freakin' out,
because we thought the cops
were gonna get called on us
and stuff. We were really
paranoid, and it was really
bad."

these things up ... in this one

really hated, because we didn’t
like the owner. So then we
decided ... we would blow them
up ... just at the checkout line,
necause that's where most of
the people would be. So we did
that, nvo o f us had done it. I

No topic is off limits with C. Everett Koop. He will talk
about medical ethics, diet, the environment’s effect on
your health, new tobacco laws, AIDS sexually transmitted
diseases, and a variety of health related issues of today.
Dr. Koop will open with a few remarks and then turn to
questions. He wants to know what is on your mind.
As Surgeon General, Koop warned the public about the
dangers of smoking, environmental health hazards and
the importance of diet, nutrition, immunization and
disease prevention.
He also became the U.S.
Government’s chief spokesman about AIDS. After
serving two terms, Dr. Koop continues to educate the
public about health issues through his writings and public
appearances.
For more information on C. Everett Koop, visit the WEB
sites of Arts and Issues (WWW.siue.edu/ARTS_ISSUES)
or C. Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth
(http://koop.dartmouth.edu/cek.htm).
This presentation is free and open to all. For students

W omen’s soccer gives defense top billing
By BRETT LICATA
S P O R T S W R IT E R

N e w s fro m the f o u l
lin e

By Todd Spann

In a class discussion th e
o th er day, M ark M cG w ire
and Samm y Sosa cam e up
in co n v ersatio n . It w as
m e n tio n e d th a t b a se b a ll
will be b o rin g n e x t y e a r
because
of
all
th e
excitem ent happ en in g this
year, thus leaving n ex t y ear
with nothing to shoot for.
So here are a few reco rd s
that might be w orthy of the
people's atten tio n .
»• 190 R B Is in a single
season. H ack W ilson pulled
this one in 1930.
>- .400 b a ttin g av erag e.
This feat h a s n 't b e e n
accom plished since T ed
Williams.
>- 60-60. If it ev er happens,
Sammy Sosa p robably has
the best chance to get 60
hom e runs an d 60 sto len
bases in a single seaso n .
That is, if he ever duplicates
his efforts this year, which
will be to u g h e n o u g h by
itself.
T here are m an y o th e r
obscure records th a t could
be broken, so stick aro u n d
and learn to like baseball
for w hat it is — a gam e of
patience and the b attle of
wills.
It is to o b a d th a t
A m erica has such a sh o rt
a tte n tio n sp a n th a t Fox
feels th at it has to use a
computer-generated
graphic a fte r ev ery ball
pitched just to keep p eople
focused
on
th e
b ad
com m entary.
O f cou rse, t h a t ’s m y
com m entary, and it is to o
bad I can 't use any sound
effects.

All the fall sports have
so m ething going on th is
w eekend, so go o u t a n d
support your Cougars.

D efen se has b een th e peren n ial
strength for the S IU E w om en's soccer
team . L ast y ear w asn ’t the m ost
prototypical of years for the back line, but
the C ougars’ defense should be back in
form as th ey o pen th e ir season this
w eekend.
S IU E will begin the regular season
Saturday against L indenw ood University,
a N ational A ssociation of Intercollegiate
A thletics pow erhouse. S IU E has not had
the best of luck w hen facing Lindenw ood.
“W e’ve struggled against L indenw ood
the past couple of years, so this will be a

good m easure o f how good we are,” head
coach B rian K orbesm eyer said. “T hey’re a
physical team th a t has good speed. T hey
also have som e ta len te d new recruits th at
will m ake th em even stronger.”
K o rbesm eyer’s expectations are high
despite last y e a r’s disappointing season
w hen S IU E w ent 15-7.
“We lost to o m any one-goal gam es last
year,” K orbesm eyer said. “I think we can
do b e tter th an 15-7.”
A n im p ro v in g d efen se sh o u ld help
S IU E win those close games. Senior K arin
Tighe will be ask ed to take control in the
C ougar backfield.
“I n eed K arin to be m ore o f a vocal
th an a physical lea d er in the backfield,”

K orbesm eyer said. “I ’m really happy with
th e im p rovem ent th a t w e’ve m ade on
defense.”
K orbesm eyer liked the w ay his team
cam e to g e th e r a fte r only a w eek o f
practice in a 2-1 loss last W ednesday to
St. L o u is U niversity — th e ir only
e x h ib itio n co n test. F re sh m an L eslie
H enigm an of Florissant, M o., had the lone
tally for the Cougars.

The recent incident involving M ike Tyson has c ce again
brought the behavior o f professional athletes intc question.
In case you h aven’t heard, Tyson was involved
a fenderb en d er w hen his wife struck an o th er car at a stoplight w hile she
was driving Tyson in his car.
Tyson flew into rage and had to be restrain ed by his
bodyguard who was follow ing in an o th er car. This professional
fighter has knocked out o th e r professionals in record tim e, and
now wants to throw dow n John Q. Public. Yeah, th a t’s fair.
D allas C ow boy A ll-P ro L arry A llen was recently accused of
forcing a topless d an cer to have sex with him at knife p o int in
his car outside a club. T he charges were later dropped.

M ason was accused o f sexual m isconduct with an und erag e girl

We live in a get-rich-quick society, and athletes are perfect
targets. M aybe Tyson was up set after the accident. Yet, w hat

being sued, why put them selves in that situation by hanging out

A n d y K atzenm oyer — cover-boy on

“W e know w hen th e y ’re taking th e ir

C o o p e r said M onday at his first w eekly

hosting to u rn am en t play,
which begins at 6 p.m.

A fter seeing his team rattle off seven wins in a row to end the
1997-98 season, head coach Bill Misiak is ready to assem ble the
1998-99 edition of the S IU E ice hockey team w ith hopes of
contending in the M id-A m erica C ollegiate H ockey A ssociation.
Tryouts for this y ear’s team will be held Sept. 9 -1 0 at the U.S.
Ice Sports Com plex on S outh R uby L ane in Fairview H eights.
T he tryout is o pen to anyone interested. P articipants are ask ed to
bring full ice hockey gear an d $50 for rink fees.
M isiak expects to see som e o f the solid players from last y e a r’s
squad com ing o u t for the team , including last y ear’s leading goal
scorer, R o b M aher.
New com ers to the team will include Belleville H igh School
graduate John Stier, A lth o ff s M ark H effernan and Nick W ooler,
G ranite C ity H igh School graduate B obby H arris, plus Jason
Pow er and Jeff Temple, w ho are both graduates of O ’Fallon H igh
School.
“E very sp o t is com petitive fo r b o th re tu rn in g an d new
players,” M isiak said. “I ’m going to do a to ta l evaluation o f skill
and hockey know ledge.”
If enough players try out, M isiak m ight keep an ad d itio n al 20
players for a jun io r varsity squad aside from the 25 th a t h e ’ll keep
for the varsity team .
“I ’d use it like a farm system ,” M isiak said. “I ’ll call players up
from the JV team to play varsity in situations such as w hen an
injury occurs.”
Starting this season, the C ougars will be an N C A A D ivision II
team after playing on p ro b atio n their first tw o years.
The M A C H A , form erly the Illinois-W isconsin C ollegiate
H ockey A ssociation, has ad ded five new schools, w hich should
m ake the season even m ore com petitive.
“E ven though they ad ded som e team s to the league, I foresee
us being very difficult to b eat,” M isiak said. “We should finish in
the top th ree easily.”
SIU E has a 30-game schedule with its hom e o p en er com ing on
O ct. 24 against th e U niversity of Illinois- C ham paign. The U.S. Ice
Sports C om plex will becom e the S IU E ’s hom e ice rink a fte r
