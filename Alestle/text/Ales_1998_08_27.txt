STAFF REPORT
As the rest of the university
prepared for the influx of
students,
building
service
workers from Local 2232 of the
American Federation of State,
County
and
Municipal
Employees
staged
an
informational picket to let
people know they want better
wages and hours.
Worker representatives said
they are upset over SIUE’s low
starting wages, which they claim
do not measure up to pay scales
at
other
Illinois
state
universities.
In a flier passed out during
the informational picketing at
the University Center recently,
employees claim the SIUE
starting wage is more than $3
less than the top starting pay at
another state school.
According to the flier,
Western Illinois University,
Eastern Illinois University and
Carbondale workers receive
starting pay slightly over $10. At
SIUE, the starting rate is $7.20,
the flier stated.
An SIUE spokesman said
the picketing by building
workers was uncalled for.

Frivolous freshman food foibles find
fulfillment following Food Service fare
BY JIM DALTON
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
When I was a freshman, I
stayed at the Residence Hall.
Like everyone else there, I had to
have a meal plan. Because no
stoves were allowed in the
Residence Hall and because my
mommy couldn’t make my meals
anymore, I, along with my
roommate Phil, ate most of my
meals in the UC basement.
Almost every day, we ate at least
a few meals at either Taco Bell,
Cougar Den or Main Course.
Being the dumb, competitive
males that we were, we would
often see who could eat the most
of something. Once I remember
drinking 12 half-pint cartons of
milk because Phil drank 10.
Sometimes these eating contests
would scare me. Not because of
the outrageous amounts of food

we consumed, but because Phil
hardly chewed his food. He ate
like some kind of starving dog.
With ferocious bites, he would
tear into his food. After chewing
maybe twice, I guess just so he
could say that he actually did
chew, he’d gulp down those large
unchewed chunks.
I was
constantly worried that he was
going to choke, and that I’d have
to see if I remembered the
Heimlich maneuver. Fortunately,
he never choked. Anyway, for the
most part, Phil and I liked the
dining services in the UC. The
food was already made so we
didn’t have to cook or clean up.
Our meal cost was automatically
deducted when they swiped our
cards, so we didn’t have to carry
cash. With Taco Bell, Pizza Hut,
Cougar Den, a deli and a salad
bar, we thought the selection was
adequate. However, it sometimes

seemed like we were in the
minority.
All the time, I heard people
complaining and whining about
the food or the service. “This
food sucks” or “Man, I wish they
had more selection” were typical
comments floating around the
UC. Most of these people just
liked to whine and never really
could back up or explain their
grumbling.
One guy told me he hated the
Pizza Hut in the UC and would
never eat there. He said he liked
Pizza Hut, but not the one in the
University Center. When I asked
why, he said something about
how the pizzas were smaller and
that it somehow mined the taste. I
wonder if this moron thought minimuffins and Butterfmger Bites also
suffered from shrunken-size flavor
souring.

The faculty and staff of Art
and Design Department are once
again displaying their talents in
an exhibition in the New Wagner
Gallery.
The annual show is meant to
enlighten students and express
their motives and experiences in
artwork. This exhibition is held
every year, and it complements
the beginning of the new
semester by showing the issues
that drive the faculty as
practicing artists.
Many elements of this show
are immediately recognizable as
work by particular members of
the faculty, while others are not
so familiar. This exhibition is a
valuable introduction to the
faculty, allowing new students
and others to see what is
practiced by the faculty in areas
of surface detail, color, technical
quality and medium.
Among
the
examples
immediately recognizable as
work by a specific member of the
faculty is Bob Malone’s piece
involving large two dimensional
examples of bulk, color forms.
He embeds large, geometric
space with textured grooves and
brush strokes. “Night Gallery”

SIUE agencies offer help, services
Staff, faculty and administrators welcome all new and returning students fo r 1998/1999.
Office of the Bursar
In recent years, the Office of
the Bursar has tried even harder to
improve customer service. One of
the first challenges we tackled was
reducing the. time that students
wait in line. We have made
improvements — lines are shorter
and move more quickly. However,
there is still work to be done. We
started the Installment Payment
Plan several years ago to ease the
financial burden for students. We
have tried to ensure courteous
service to every customer.
The number of services that
we provide is expanding. A few
years ago, we sent about 7,000
financial aid refund checks to
students; we expect to issue more
than 20,000 this year. Last year
marked the start of financial
management counseling for
students and our first participation
in
International
Student
Orientation. This year, we will
begin accepting payments for
telephone service from students
living in University Housing.
We continue to expand the
use of technology. For example,
we are currently evaluating a new
cashiering system that will fix the
“Year 2000” problem, and will
allow us to provide even better
service to students in the future.
We want to do the very best
job we can for you. Let us know
how we can help. We look forward
to serving you. Welcome to SIUE.

Department of Chemistry
The
Department
of
Chemistry is composed of 14
faculty with approximately 100
students as current majors. There
are 10 second-year graduate
students and eight new first-year
graduate students.
The department strives to
develop in its students not only
educational
excellence
in
chemical facts and knowledge, but
also skills that will be useful in the
workplace.
Most
of
the
department is actively engaged in
research and thereby provides
opportunities to develop hands-on
skills in experimental design and
interpretation of results. The
research opportunities include
areas of chemistry in inorganic,
organic, biochemical, physical,
environmental and analytical
studies. It also has an active
Chemistry Club, open to non­
majors, that has won national
recognition. The club visits many
local businesses to see chemical
applications in a variety of forms
including forensics, biotechnology
and beer-making. The club invites
outside speakers to present and
discuss current topics in chemistry
or science in general. The
department is also investigating
the use of workshops for
beginning students to develop
skills in analytical thought
processes and team dynamics.

Workshops have not only
increased students’ abilities to
work chemistry problems but has
developed a more interactive
group of students outside the
lecture hall, which is healthy to the
overall
scholastic
attitude.
Additionally, our department is
committed to science education
not only at the college level, but
also for grades kindergarten
through high school. Several of
our members are very active in
working with area teachers to
enhance technical training in
science as well as making
numerous visits to local schools
for science ‘shows.’ This provides
an active and positive presence to
the local communities. We have
made every effort to share the
excitement of chemistry with our
students and local community.

Catholic Campus Ministry
welcomes all new and returning
students to the fall semester at
SIUE. In this brief message, we
would like to present the various
activities and opportunities that
our ministry provides to the
university community.
CCM exists to serve the
religious, spiritual and educational
needs of the university’s students,,
staff and faculty. We believe that
God is found in every dimension
of our lives. As a community of
believers, we seek to celebrate that
faith, to witness to its vitality, and
to act according to its call by
facilitating experiences of spiritual
enrichment, faith development,
and leadership in service to God
and others. Our activities revolve
around three main areas of
emphasis: Worship and Faith
Formation: Sunday Mass (10:30
a.m. and 8 p.m.) is the core of our
worshipping
experience.
In
addition, we offer a variety of
sacramental preparation programs,
Bible study, small group prayers,
days of recollection and retreats.
We encourage all to be active
participants in the liturgical
planning, choir, music ministry or
as liturgical ministers. Social
Justice Involvement: What we
proclaim in worship, we strive to
live in our daily life through direct
involvement in social action.
CCM
strives
to
create
opportunities for SIUE students
throughout the year to take time to,
stop and contemplate their lives,,
relationships and God. CCM and
the Newman Student Union
sponsor a variety of serviceoriented activities such as Habitat
for Humanity, Urban Plunge, Hunt
for Hunger, Adopt-A-Kid, and
Homelessness Awareness. In
collaboration with Kimmel, we
sponsor Alternative Spring Break.
CCM aims to establish an annual
immersion experience overseas to
promote
global
solidarity.
Community Life: Through all
what we proclaim and do, we seek
to build a community of Christian

Special Services
Welcome back to your home
away from home, SIUE! Be
encouraged, students, even when
you sometimes feel like you are in
a race to achieve your degree
without a personal coach and not
enough resources to enable you to
reach your goal effectively. In the
Special Services office at SIUE, I
feel proud to be one of the four
coaches who motivate students,
help define career choices and
monitor progress throughout the
semester, assuring the completion
of degree requirements. Our staff
includes
Earleen
Patterson,
program director, and advisers
Margene
Jerrolds,
Danita
Mumphard and Toni Whittaker.
And our secretary is Vera Goode,
who assists staff and students in
various areas.
Being that our department is
federally
funded
and has
regulations that we must abide by,
not everyone is entitled to our
privileges. However, we do serve
students who may be at least a
first-generation college student
and have academic need. Our
program is proud to have a higher
retention and graduation rate than
other students of like backgrounds
without these supports. The
Special Services program is in
demand and admission is limited.
Our
office
offers
supplemental instruction for
qualified students, as well as peer
mentoring connections, free
tickets to cultural events and
midterm grade reports twice each
semester. In fact, more than 12
qualified tutors are hired to assist
in various general-education
courses and some major courses.
We are also proud of our peer
mentoring
program,
where
upperclassmen volunteer to give
Special
Services
freshmen
academic and personal wisdom
from their SIUE experience. Our
mentors exceed 50 dedicated

students.
All
qualified,
enthusiastic
volunteers
are
welcome to serve our first-year
students. If you have an interest in
the mentoring program, write

We want to encourage all
students to keep striving for their
goal. The race is not given to the
swift, nor the strong, but to the one
who endures until the end. You
can make it!

Environment Health and
Safety
Environmental Health and
Safety would like to welcome
you and say thanks for making
our recycling program a success.
This past year, the Illinois
Recycling Association awarded
SIUE honorable mention for
"Outstanding
University
Recycling Program.” The honor
was based on our efforts over the
past four years to expand both the
quantity and variety of materials
included in the program. Without
your participation, we would not
have received this award.
The University is now able
to recycle a broader variety of
paper products. You will see
collection
bins
located
throughout buildings on the
campus core. Examples of the
types of paper that can be
recycled are white or pastelcolored paper, envelopes and
legal pads (yellow or green). We
also
recycle
newspapers,
magazines and aluminum. Again,
you will see the containers all
around campus. We would
appreciate your using them. For a
more comprehensive listing of
what can be recycled, as well as
information on location and
collection, check our webpage at
http://ehs.siue.edu/.
Recently, we received ï
$47,270 grant from the Illinois
Department of Commerce and
Community
Affairs
for

expansion of the University
Housing recycling program. The
grant will provide a baler for
cardboard and aluminum, as well
as eight conveniently located
recycling cluster stations for
Cougar Village residents. Other
large
containers
will
be
purchased and placed near
vending and laundry areas.
•Promotion of the expanded
program will be supported by
educational videos shown on
University Housing’s public
access
cable
channel.
A
distribution of promotional Tshirts and refillable thermal mugs
will be at Woodland Hall in the
next few weeks. A similar event
was held at Cougar Village
during the summer.
We wish you the best in your
academic endeavors. Thanks
again for participating in our
recycling program!

Success out of suffering
Their life w a sn ’t a crystal stair so mine would be.
I don’t know what it’s like to be poor. And it’s not
that I want to. My parents worked long days and nights
to make sure I’d never know what they knew growing
up in the rural South. I never had to have a Christmas
without presents or go without meals while away at
Danielle college. 1 didn’t have to sleep on beds made out of hay
Belton or cook breakfast for my seven brothers. My parents did
that so I wouldn't have to, and that makes me very
humble.
Some people walk around as if they have only themselves to
thank for their success. I’ll be the first to say I can’t really claim any
of mine. I was only born into the right family with the right gene
pool at the right time. By luck or design, I wasn't bom an African
Pygmy or an Australian Aborigine, nor the daughter of a Norwegian
goatherder. I was bom here and now, and I was just lucky.
It’s overwhelming to think about sometimes, and I think about
it quite a bit. but my family suffered for more than four generations
in this country so my sisters and I could grow up with central air
conditioning and cable TV, so we could blossom in good schools and
eat the good parts of the chicken instead of necks and backs. I only
eat white meat, when just yesterday in my family, white meat was
not what was served on the table. Family is about sacrifice, and the
elders in my family sacrificed for each generation that came after
them.
My grandmother’s grandfather escaped slavery in Mississippi
so he could give his family a better home in Arkansas. Then her
father made sure my grandmother and her brothers and sisters all
knew how to read. My Aunt Ollie, my grandmother’s sister, even got
to go to college, something that wasn’t very common. My
grandmother in turn worked along with my grandfather as
sharecroppers picking cotton on a plantation. Due to her ability to
save any extra penny and my grandfather’s ability to get a job at a
mill, they were able to build a house. This in turn led to my mother,
who helped raise her brothers and her sister. Mom then went off to
college. She went to college with everything in one suitcase and she
didn’t get to eat much. She cleaned hotels, worked in grocery stores
and in a variety of other jobs to get her teaching certificate. She
eventually came to St. Louis as a teacher.
My father likes to remind me how his mother was very much
about sacrifice for his family. He often tells stories of how he used
to think his mother liked to eat the backs and necks of the chicken.
In reality, after he and his brothers were through, that was what was
left. But she ate less, so they could have more. His parents worked
so my father could eventually go to college. My father worked every
job from delivering papers to being a dishwasher, then a cook. He's
an engineer for Boeing now, but look what a road there was to travel.
I know it must be obvious, but I have to say, I’m very proud of
my family. To overcome slavery, racism, poverty and gender bias is
not a small feat, especially when some of us are still fighting. But all
of this is so another generation won’t have to go through what the
previous one did. And that is why I love history. The will of the
human spirit fascinates me. All of us should be proud of our history.
In mine, it wasn’t about self-preservation, but the preservation of the
next generation.

Commentary
I rarely agree with Bill
Clinton’s politics. I didn’t vote
for him in 1992 or in 1996. That
doesn’t mean I can overthrow
him because of our political
differences. Unless the Senate
agrees that the Constitution (our
most basic social contract) is in
grave danger, Clinton should
remain in office. He was
constitutionally elected twice.
The problem for Bill Clinton
is that so many people disagree
with the way he handles social
policy. They wanted him stopped
in 1996, but the opponents did
not mount a winning campaign.
In the commerce of political
ideas, Bill Clinton won and the
electorate granted him the power
to operate the executive branch
until Jan. 20, 2001.
The
drumbeat
for
impeachment during the summer
of 1998 is getting as much
attention as the same drumbeat
received about 130 years ago.
Andrew Johnson was not in favor
of vigorously enforcing the
Reconstruction Acts passed by
Congress. The decisions he made
about enforcing those laws
infuriated his political opponents.
The president reversed the
decisions of several generals in
command
of
Southern
reconstruction districts. He didn’t
like the way they enforced the
acts. Congress had passed a law
that prohibited the president from
firing Senate-approved executive
officers. The president fired
Secretary of War Stanton because
of political differences with the
secretary. Johnson's political
opponents in the Congress began
to act. By 1868, they had
approved a bill of impeachment
and set it for a Senate trial.
Andrew Johnson had been
Lincoln’s vice president. In those
days, when the president died and
the vice president became
president, no new vice president
was'appointed. If Johnson were
removed, the president pro
tempore of the Senate, Benjamin

F. Wade, would have becomS
president. That man’s political
philosophy, which included soft
money and high tariffs, had many
opponents. Johnson defenders
reminded Senate colleagues that
there would be a political shift
with a new man in the White
House and they may not like the
changes. Better the devil you
know. Johnson survived the
Senate trial and served out his
term.
The Johnson case dealt with
the freshly defeated Southern
states.
Johnson’s
political
opponents wished to replace his
political agenda with their own.
They came dangerously close to
making the United States more
European in our political style.
Europe has a long history of
replacing the executive head of
government using extralegal
means.
The United States’ president
is president for a constitutionally
specified period. Nothing is
supposed to change that unless
the republic itself is in danger.
When we elect a president, we
elect him because we believe he
has the capability to safely
operate the levers of government
and the military in our name. It
should be very hard to undo that
vote through impeachment.
Nixon seemed at the time to
threaten liberty itself and was
allowed to resign. Johnson
threatened
Congressional
political authority during the
reconstruction of the South but
survived. Clinton’s outcome is
unclear. In the Constitution, there
are four items listed as reasons to
impeach: treason, bribery, high
crimes and misdemeanors.
Clinton may have perjured
himself in the Paula Jones case.
Should that be enough to change
the outcome of two elections?

impeachment
precedent,
impeachment of Bill Clinton
would seem less probable to his
opponents. The more often we
witness
impeachment
proceedings, the easier it gets for
the Senate to remove a president
for the benefit of changing the
executive branch’s political
direction. Does anyone believe
that it was the intent of the
Founding Fathers for Congress to
use impeachment for political
purposes? Perhaps the intent was
to give Congress a method of
removing a president who was
betraying his country. This
method allows for a legal
transmission of power from the
traitor and back into the hands of
a president loyal to the
Constitution.
Bill
Clinton’s political
legacy, when separated from his
lucky economic fortunes, will not
shine from the pages of future
elementary
school
history
textbooks. His bland offerings as
president will be as wellremembered as the offerings of
most of the other presidents few
have heard of. Why create yet
another deep political crisis when
Jan. 20, 2001, is not that far
away?
Those who wish to lead as
our next president should start
running by presenting winning
ideas to the electorate. Americans
vote for good ideas. That is how
our nation determines if the
people wish to continue or
change the political direction of
the United States. We do not
allow the decision to change one
president for another to be made
in the Senate cloakroom. That
would truly be un-American.

Michael Joslyn also has an
unmistakable quality embedded
in his pencil drawings; Joslyn
slams an incredible amount of
information into each scenario.
For example, each wrinkle on
each figure’s face has been
clearly delineated. He is also very
skilled at creating surface design
around his central figures. Much
attention has been paid to space
and shacJow, and each face has
been drawn as if reflecting
emotion and thought.

FOOD----------------

from p a g e 1

My dining experiences at the
UC have, for the most part, been
pleasant, sometimes outlandish.
Anyway, on the whole, the dining
service at SIUE is pretty good.
Breakfast
Breakfast, which begins at
7:30 a.m. on weekdays and 10
a.m. on weekends, is probably
my favorite meal of the day. The
UC is deserted since most college
students seem to skip breakfast,
and the food is pretty good. At

traveling to China. He has
stacked depictions of Chinese
coins, which are often said to
bring good luck, into a calendar­
like ordering. He also includes
the form of the Chinese dragon,
which has served Chinese
symbolism as the representation
of power and imperial reign. This
long, snake-like creature slinks

about
the
lower
corner
magnificently, as if about to
crawl off the page.
Dennis Ringering has also
included two works based on his
sabbatical
travels
in
the
Southwest.
His
petroglyph
drawings based on the rock
carvings of ancient American
cultures, whose iconography has

(bacon, eggs, hash browns,
pancakes, etc.) is served. There is
also a decent selection of bagels,
cereal, juice and milk. All the
caffeine addicts can get their
morning fix at Cafe Java, which
serves a variety of gourmet
coffees. If you want to upset the
worker, go up and ask for a
regular coffee.
Lunch
Lunchtime can get crowded,
especially at the beginning of the
hour when everyone gets out of
class. Once you fight your way
through the herds of people, your
best choices are probably Taco

Bell, Deli Express or the Cougar
Den. If you want to avoid the
crowd or like a restaurant
atmosphere, venture upstairs to
the University Restaurant. Along
with table service, there is "all
you care to eat" salad bar.
Dinner
Dinner is pretty much the
same as lunch. The selection
becomes a little more limited
because about half the places
close. The menu does slightly
shift to typical dinner items such
as steaks, chicken, baked
potatoes, pasta, etc.

Other pieces entered into this
exhibition simply allow the
audience to identify the area in
which each professor teaches.
Jon Denhouter has submitted
two watercolor paintings, each
showing soft, melting colors. His
abstraction, “Untitled,” offers
puddles of color while proving
technical adeptness by shaping
its forms, and not allowing them
to meld together. Laura Stand’s
piece, titled “Memory Letter 1,”
also provides insight to the
medium through which she
communicates. Her letters have
been screened onto silk, layered
and attached to a large sheet. The
result is a very soft, delicate story
presented as if unraveling.

Meal Plans

the meal plan is voluntary. You
can either purchase the Cougar
Plan ($500) or the Voluntary Plan
($100). If those plans still fall out
of your range, you can put any
amount above $25 on your card.

If you live in a residence
hall, you should have already
signed up for either Meal Plan A,
B or C. My only advice is to use
the money responsibly. I knew a
guy who ran out of money with
five weeks of school left. I'm not
sure what or if he ate for those
five weeks because every time I
saw him he looked hungry. He
ended up flunking out and
leaving SIUE.

This exhibition will hang in the
gallery until September 25. New
Wagner Gallery hours extend
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday.

For those of you who live at
Cougar Village or off campus,

Welcome to SIU Edwardsville.
We are concerned about your safety and encourage you to use caution as you cross University
Drive on your way from the campus core buildings to one of the blue or red parking lots (1-13).
Traffic can be heavy at times during the day on University Drive; unfortunately, those are also
the times when pedestrian use is heavy. The combination makes for frequent, and potentially
dangerous interaction.,
Last spring, a student pedestrian in a campus crosswalk at SIU Carbondale was struck by a car
and seriously injured. No one wants to see such an accident here, but we all must act to keep it from
happening.
First o f all, when you cross University Drive, use one of the marked crosswalks. Jaywalking is
very dangerous, and it is also illegal. When you reach the crosswalk, be sure that the oncoming traffic
sees you and is slowing down to stop. Sometimes drivers are careless, or they are speeding and do
not intend to stop. While they may be at fault, it is the pedestrian who is at serious risk of harm. Be
careful at crosswalks.
When you drive, remember that pedestrians in crosswalks have the right of way and stay under
25 mph so you can stop when you need to. As long as a pedestrian is in the crosswalk — either side,
either lane — you must yield the right of way by stopping. Please drive carefully, and please notice
pedestrians who are crossing the street or are about to cross. Slow down. Yield to them by stopping
at marked crosswalks. It’s the law, and it is safe.
University Police officers enforce these State laws by issuing state citations that carry heavy
penalties, andpotentially, jail time. You may also be subject to University disciplinary action. No
one is taking this situation lightly. Do not endanger your future by jaywalking, speeding or driving
recklessly on campus. As we learned last spring, lives could be at stake.

you plan and prepare for big

you look smart.
Whether you are living on
campus or staying at home,
things are going to change. Either
way, make the best of your
situation by dressing up your
living conditions.

don’t need an expensive one, but
note: the cheaper the clock, the
more annoying the alarm. (One to
try is the Magnavox AM/FM

wages paid by SIUE and of the
university’s response in the
media.

newspaper that the top building
service worker pay is more than
$16 per hour. She added that the
spokesman has never had any
involvement in the negotiations.
The representative must

school

Brumfield said.
Brumfield said that only
certain service workers can make
more than $10, and said she
wants to see pay scales equal to
those at other state universities.
She also challenged Neher’s
figure of a 16 percent rate hike.
Brumfield said the union is
asking for a 3 percent raise.
“It’s not close to other
universities, but it is a step,”
Brumfield said. “If [SIUE’s
administrators] don’t take the 3

percent, then we don’t want to try
to deal.”
She said workers at SIUE’s
sister school at Carbondale earn
more than their counterparts
here.
“Students expect the same
from
both
universities,”
Brumfield said. “Why can’t the
workers?”
Neher said that the average
employee makes $11.30, plus
two weeks of vacation, as well as
free schooling.

He added that the pickets
may have sent a message that
talks have broken down, but that
is not the case. Neher said
negotiations are continuing and
that there has been no request for
an independent mediator.
“This is simply a wage
reopener and negotiations are not
at an impasse,” Neher said.
Neher also said that the type
of work done by the building
service workers only pays about
minimum wage in the St. Louis
area.

NEEDS

from p a g e 6

— A phone: You’ll need a
phone to stay in touch with mom
and dad, not to mention friends
on and off campus. Southwestern
Bell offers classic phones to
cordless ones with answering
machines. (They range from
$9.99 to $119.99.)
— Sheets and towels: Go for

lighter colors when it comes to
sheets and towels, because darker
colors bleed and fade. (Target has
a complete set of sheets that are
made out of T-shirt material for
$17.99, and a variety of towels
for around $1.99.)
— Candles: Dress up your
room with a variety of candles to
set a tone. Just be careful to put
them out when you leave the
room (usually around $.99 each).

There are other necessities
that you’ll need to make your
college experience memorable:
— Visa, American Express,
MasterCard or any major credit
card: We’ve all heard about how
dangerous these can be, and how
they should only be used for

emergencies. This is college, and
you should be having fun, so
limit yourself to one or two major
cards and stay away from the
department
store
cards.
(Application is free.)
The most important thing
that you will need in college and

throughout life is a good attitude.
This time is supposed to be fun
and exciting, but it is not always
going to be. Whether you're
having difficulty adjusting to the
people, classes or whatever, a
good attitude will make any
situation brighter (Priceless).

Under Construction
“W hat’s happening on campus?
There hasn't been this much construction since they built the place!” It's true. The
Edwardsville campus has not seen this much construction in decades. The future Engineering
Building is a mud flat across from the Art & Design Building. The second residence center Prairie
Hall, nears completion south of W oodland Hall. Every parking lot on campus is being redone. All
o f the sidewalks in the campus core are being replaced or repaired. Roads have been closed for
repair. The smell o f paint is prevalent, and rolls o f carpel are stored in the hall. As the result of
capital project funding, bonds funds for parking lots and residence halls, and new state funding for
building maintenance the campus sometimes resembles one large construction site. As the local
cable company keeps reminding us, “The inconvenience is temporary, the results long lasting.
The first phase of ADA improvements and the M yer Arboretum are completed. Sidewalk repairs
will be com pleted within a week and the parking lot and road work this fall. The Engineering.
Building will be completed for classes in the Fall o f 2000.
The increased m aintenance activity will continue indefinitely. Both the increased painting
and carpeting programs are ongoing programs that will continue to have a positive impact on the
campus appearance as well as the work and study environment. Repairs unseen are improving
ventilation as well as temperature controls in many buildings. Other w ork is reducing the number
of roof leaks with a goal o f none.
W ithin the next few w eeks you will see new and/or refinished furniture in the lobbies.
Sometime in early fall there will be new roadway directional signs with proper building names.
The old abandoned greenhouse will be removed from the roof o f the Science Building this fall. The
wall coverings in the Science A uditoriums will be replaced and the acoustic separation between
some classrooms will be improved this year. Additional work that will be completed this year will
install electronic message entry signs at two campus entrances, and additional work at the Korte
Stadium will improve accessibility and functionality. Construction begins on a new darkroom in
the Art & Design Building, a lab for the Nursing program, and new com puter labs in Alumni Hall.
Program m ing has begun to replace/renovate the East St. Louis Center and to renovate and
update the Edwardsville Science Building. These projects both require additional capital funding
to complete. That funding could occur as early as next year for the East St. Louis Center.
Even with all o f these im provem ents, there are still occasional problems with rooms being
too hot or cold, roof leaks, unsatisfactory restrooms, lights out, etc. W hen you have a problem in
any academ ic building, please call W ork O rder Control at ext. 3711 o r E-m ail us at

■ BY COREY STULCE
WRITER-AT-LARGE
St. Louis must now be considered a major city (or a tourist
attraction) now that it holds both a Planet Hollywood and a
Hard Rock Cafe.
Earlier this month, a grand opening celebration was held on the
Landing at Planet Hollywood, even though the movie-themed
restaurant has been open for many months.
An estimated 40,000 attended, including co-owner Bruce Willis,
St. Louis-native John Goodman, Melanie Griffith, William Baldwin,
James Caan as well as other minor celebs. It was unclear why some
of these semi-famous people would want to attend such an event,
unless they just want the public to know they are still alive and
seeking work.
Thousands of screaming fans lined the 700 foot red carpet, hoping
to get an autograph or a photo of one of their favorite celebs. In what
might be considered obsessive fashion, some people had apparently
waited in the heat of the August day for up to 10 hours before the
festivities even began.
The evening was hosted by former St. Louis disk jockey Todd
Newton and still-working (and many times fired) disc jockey J. C.
Corcoran.
The Hard Rock Cafe opened its doors Monday and is located at
Union Station in St. Louis.

News from the

File Photo/Alestle

I By Todd Spann

With an 18-2-1
record last
season, the
m en ’s soccer
team rolled into
the NCAA
tournament.

L et’s help the freshmen
get off on the right foot and
clear up some things that
might be concerning them.
YES, we do have an
athletic departm ent.
YES,
the
athletic
program s have been very
successful.
A nd YES, Homecoming
has a soccer game.

St. Louis slugger Mark
M cGw ire is taking some
heat from the m edia about
his legal over-the-counter
supplem ent Andro.
OK,
people,
Doc
G ooden d id n ’t tak e this
much media pressure, and
he was using illegal drugs.

The St. Louis Ram s have
started their football pre­
season . 1-2. B ut nobody
knows how they won even
that many.

The Chicago B ears are
0-3 this pre-season, and
nobody really cares.

Sammy Sosa is keeping
good pace with McGwire
in the hom erun chase.
But unlike M ac’s homers,
Sammy’s m ean something.
Maybe postseason.

SIU E is growing quickly,
but
the
stands
are
staying em pty around the
playing fields.
The m ost frequently
asked
q u estion
am ong
college students is: W hat’s
there to do that is cheap?
G o to an SIU E ballgame.
It’s free.

Cougars try to repeat last year’s
performance through cohesiveness
■ BRETT LICATA
SPORTS W R ITER
C ohesiveness will be the
goal this year for a team that
defined the word last season.
A fter taking his SIU E
m en’s soccer team to an 18-2-1
record, capturing G reat Lakes
Valley Conference titles and a
trip to the N C A A tournam ent
last year, head coach Ed
H uneke is taking this season
one step at a time.
SIUE graduated a handful
of talented players from last
year’s squad, but old and new
faces will attem pt to m eet the
high expectations th at have
been set for this year’s team.
“We have a big senior class
and a big freshm an class, so the
quicker the freshm en learn, the
b etter,” H uneke said. “Last

year we had m uch more
experience and a heavy crop of
junior and seniors who had
played together for a num ber
of years. That kind of bond will
take time to develop with all of
the new players coming in.”
O ne of the six seniors who
will be asked to lead the team
is A ll-A m erican m idfielder
and captain M att Little of
G ranite City.
Little led the Cougars in
goals, assists and total points
along with being nam ed the
GLVC’s Most Valuable Player
last year.
“As a senior and captain, it’s
my job to get everybody in
sync,” Little said. “I have high
expectations for myself. I want
to try and do as well as I did
last year.”
H uneke is glad to have

Get off Mac’s back
“There are 10 o r 12 guys on this team who use the stuff. There
are guys all over baseball who use it. So why is all the attention
on m e?”
That doesn’t sound like a quote from som eone who makes
millions playing a boy’s game, not som ething that a m an who is
better than anyone else at what he does would say. R ather, it
sounds like the words of a bitter, paranoid, beaten-dow n man.
Well, m aybe a little of both. The quote is from M ark McGwire in
response to m edia inquiries about his taking the supplement
A ndrostenedione, or A ndro as it is commonly called. While I
w on’t get into the health concerns, I do want to talk about the
way things were handled in the media.
First of all, M ark McGwire should not have to be the national
spokesm an to our youth about health and fitness. People say that
because McGwire is taking Andro, high school or college athletes
will start abusing Andro. This is a different case than wanting to
be like Mike and wearing his kind of shoes. You can’t overdose

a leader like L ittle in
the midfield.
“It is com forting knowing
we have the best individual
player in th e conference
and a returning All-American
controlling th e m idfield for
us,” H uneke said.
Joining Little as a projected
scorer of the Cougars will be
senior Todd H u n ter of St.
Peters, Mo. H unter and Little
team ed up to win the U nder 23
N ational C ham pionship as
m em bers of Scott Gallagher
over the summer. H unter led
Scott G allagher in scoring after
posting 17 points for SIUE last
year despite injuries.

on Nike. (Although that is questionable.) I understand he is
taking something that we do n ’t know much about. But M ark
McGwire is m aking a choice by taking a legal over-the-counter
supplement. If other athletes want to do the same, then they
should also do the research that McGwire has done.
I do n ’t blam e the media for violence in our society or teen
pregnancy, but I do blame them for making some people’s lives
miserable. I was still on the m edia’s side when they were asking
McGwire the same m undane questions, and he was getting
annoyed. I thought, “Hey, Mark. You’re rich, famous and the
crowned savior of baseball. A few questions w on’t hurt.” But this
is too much. The media got tired of writing about the millions of
dollars McGwire gives to charity, the great compassion he has for
abuse victims and the love he shows his son. The media needed
more. It was a race to see who could be the first to dig up the dirt
on McGwire.To his credit, look how long it took to find
something negative, and look how weak the case is.

Ed H uneke, will also see tim e at forw ard in a
substitute role.
In the midfield, H uneke will give time to a group of young
players to accompany Little. Freshman Scott Taylor of Liberty,
Mo., and Chris K nopp of St. Louis possess good skills.
Sophomore Eric M odeer of Hershey, Pa., displays soft feet and is
good possessing the ball. Brian Douglas is also a promising
newcomer who is hard-working and tenacious, but a knee injury
will keep him out of the lineup three to four weeks.
Seniors Kividi Kikam a and Doug H artm ann will anchor the
defense along with Jeff Stevens, who was an All-Conference
perform er while playing at Western Illinois University the past
three seasons.
“Kividi and Doug are seasoned, quality players, who we expect
a lot from this year,” H uneke said. “Kividi’s ability to handle
things as the sweeper is a huge positive for our squad.”
Junior Justin Bernaix and freshman Cress M addox will also
see time on the back line.
Senior Chris Koenig of Florissant, Mo., will take over the
goalkeeping duties after spending most of his career at SIUE as
a backup.
The Cougars began the preseason with a 5-2 loss to Eastern
Illinois University, but both Huneke and Little think that the
game was closer than the score made it appear.
“We made some m ental mistakes that we need to correct, but
we played with them the whole game,” Little said.
“We struggled at times, but it served its purpose ... for us to
become a better team ,” Huneke said.
The Cougars will open their season when they host the SIUE
Tournam ent Sept. 5 and 6. The squad will have its third and final
exhibition match Sunday in the SIUE alumni game at 5 p.m. at
Bob G uelker Field.
SIUE will go into the season ranked No. 12 in the nation and
No. 2 in the GLVC preseason poll, just below the University of
Wisconsin-Parkside.
