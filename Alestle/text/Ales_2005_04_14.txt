Trouble no longer
brewing for Starbucks

reem an

Starbucks is no longer in hot
water now that a case against the
company, claiming a cup was
defective, has been dropped.
M o lly Alter, a graduate
student in metalsmithing at
S1UE, claimed the cup of coffee
she had purchased from the
Starbucks
in
the
Morris
University Center had collapsed
in her hands. The cup allegedly
collapsed Dec. 3, 2003, and she
filed the suit in 2004.
She claimed the bum from
the coffee rendered her unable to
finish the semester and sought
more than $50,000 in damages.

Judge George J. Moran ruled
Starbucks was entitled to the
same protections and immunity
as the university.
“The Court of Claims is the
proper venue for the case,”
Moran wrote in his court order,
referring to the forum set up by
the state of Illinois to resolve all
claims against state entities.
“We’re disappointed because
my argument had been that we
were not suing the state,” Alter’s
attorney Matthew Marlen told the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Lawsuits over spilled coffee
are nothing new. In 1994, a New
Mexico woman was awarded
$2.9 million in damages after she

“The award seeks to identify
faculty members who are leaders
in curriculum development for
their
department,
have
consistently
high
teaching
evaluations from students and are

accessible to students for
advising and supervision of
independent projects,” computer
science professor and University

nominees consistently improve
their
teaching
by
using
evaluation feedback, attending
teaching seminars and integrating
new research on teaching
strategies
into
their own
classrooms.”

Powell said most universities
present similar awards.
“The Teaching Excellence
Award will go to a tenured or
tenure-track faculty member with
at least three years o f experience
at
SIUE.
The
Teaching
Recognition Award goes to a
non-tenure track instructor with
at least three years experience at

Thursday
in
Prairie Hall’s Multifunction

“We decided to host the
event in Prairie Hall as a way to

get more student involvement,”
blood
drive
co-coordinator
Sabrina Washington said. “This
way, with the donation so close,
students will find it easier to give
blood and, hopefully, we will
have a greater turnout of students
than we usually see.”
Washington said this is
a
good
opportunity
for
students.
“This is a chance for students
to give back to the community,”
Washington said. “Also, one day,
students could need blood, and

this is a way o f showing that you
understand need.”
Washington, a Prairie Hall
resident advisor, has been
planning the event since the
beginning of the spring semester,
along with Jarod Rowley, also a
Prairie Hall RA.
Those interested may sign up

Okay, normally I’m not one
to get involved in politics, but
Wisconsin has taken hunting to a

new low. Now, whether or not
you are a dog person or a cat
person, I can’t possibly image
what that state is considering.
A proposal has gone forward
to make free-roaming cats,
including domestic cats without
collars, listed as an unprotected
species. If it passes, then the cats
could be hunted. According to an
article on America Online news,
the proposal was one of several in
a spring vote over hunting and
fishing issues by the Wisconsin
Conservation Congress.

“La Crosse firefighter Mark
Smith, 48, helped spearhead the
cat-hunting proposal,” the article
said. “He wants Wisconsin to
declare free-roaming wild cats an
unprotected species, just like
skunks or gophers. Anyone with
a small-game license could shoot
the cats at will.”
Perhaps it is just me, but
when I think of domestic cats, I
just can’t put them in the same
category as skunks or gophers.
Perhaps there are some small
wild cats that are nuisances and

perhaps even dangerous, but I
know there are many people out
there who have pets and don’t
keep them in the house. These
animals, cats included, can’t
always be trusted to keep their
collars on themselves. So, are
we just going to let people
start shooting at Fluffy while
she’s crossing the street? What
about poor Mr. Whiskers? Is he
next on the list for target
practice?
Sure, it’s not like the people
in favor of the change are just out
after kitties. The article said,
“Every year in Wisconsin alone,
an estimated two million wild
cats kill 47 million to 139 million
songbirds, according to state
officials.”
I think, perhaps, there are
better
solutions
to
an
overpopulation of cats. How
about spaying and neutering our
pets? What about catching them
and then fixing them? I just don’t
believe shooting is the way to
solve problems, even if it is the
loss of birds. Anyone else
who agrees with me can find

New trends put sqeeze on bottle industry
COLLEGE PARK, Md. (UWIRE) - Today’s topic is an
alarming consumer trend that
threatens each and every honest,
hardworking student, and I’m not
talking about Ashton Kutcher
movies released in back-to-back
months.
I am referring to how
everything these days comes in
squeeze bottles. To the product
manufacturers, I say, “Dude,
where’s my glass jar of jelly?”
The prevalence of squeeze
bottles really hit me during spring
break. My brother and I were out
of toothpaste, so I asked my
mom, a dental hygienist and
resident toothpaste expert, to get
us another tube. Much to my
surprise, however, I soon found a
squeeze bottle of vanilla-flavored
toothpaste in the bathroom. Don’t
get me started on those
nauseating flavored toothpastes.
Toothpaste is not supposed to
taste good - that’s why you spit it
out.
Seeing the squeeze bottle
was disappointing because there
is no greater investment than a

tube o f toothpaste. Tubes last
forever - even longer if you
squeeze really, really hard. When
I came back to school, I was still
thinking about the squeeze bottle,
so I asked my mom why j she
bought it. She responded, “What
did you do for dinner tonight?”
Eventually, she explained
that toothpaste squeeze bottles
are not as messy as the tubes. Her
reasoning translates well in the
kitchen, where squeeze bottles
are most prevalent. After all, if
you come back from a hard night
o f “studying” and have a
hankering for a turkey sandwich,
it is much easier to get
mayonnaise out o f a squeeze
bottle than scraping it out of a jar.
But I use mustard on my
turkey, and I don’t like the new
mustard squeeze bottles. The old
ones, you may recall, looked like
Humpty Dumpty wearing a
dunce cap. The best feature of
those bottles was the nozzle,
which easily navigated the
mustard onto the sandwich. The
new bottles, on the other hand,
are rectangular with handle

grooves on the sides and a little
nub on top; they most closely
resemble bottles of designer
cologne. Lacking a nozzle for
navigation, these bottles often
cause me to close my eyes and
squeeze, hoping against hope that
mustard somehow lands on my
food.
The same thing goes for
ketchup. The long-necked plastic
bottle, ideal for navigation, has
been replaced with an oversized,
cologne-like squeeze bottle.
Unlike the new mustard bottles,
the new ketchup bottles are so
unwieldy I simply worry about
keeping ketchup off my shirt, let
alone getting it on my food.
The biggest casualty of
the squeeze-bottle revolution,
however, is jelly. In my
refrigerator, I have a squeeze
bottle o f strawberry jelly. It
squirts easily right on top of the
peanut butter on my cinnamon
swirl bread, which is exactly why
I don’t like it.
When we were kids, making
a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich meant getting your

hands sticky. It meant screwing
the top off the jelly jar, dipping a
knife deep into a glass coated
with dried-on jelly, struggling to
balance the jelly on the knife and
repeating the process until the
knife sticks to your hand. Five
hours later, and after taking a
shower to get all the jelly off
yourself, you enjoyed that
sandwich as if it were the last one
on Earth.
I don’t like squeeze bottles
because they are so different
from what I grew up with. Fifty
years from now, I can see myself
telling my grandchildren about
how we used to get ketchup from
glass bottles, but only if we hit it
right on the 57.
My grandchild would say,
“More ketchup, please,” and a
hologram of a ketchup bottle
would appear in midair. The child
touches the hologram, turning the
image into a real bottle that pours
right on a plate.
“Bah,” I would say. “That’s
nothing. Back in my day, we had
actual ketchup bottles. Not only

fro m page 4

did we have to hit them just
right to get ketchup out, but we
had to do it while walking five
miles uphill to school in the
snow!”
Though I may not like
squeeze bottles, I have to accept
they are here to stay. That’s OK
because, even though glass jars

and old-school plastic bottles
may become obsolete, my
memories of those sticky jelly
fingers will last almost as long as
a tube of toothpaste.

Ivers

STILLWATER, Okla. (UWIRE)
— The sounds of
sniffling, sneezing and coughing
have erupted across the nation.
The pollen count increases
during
the
spring,
which
can cause people who suffer
from allergies and asthma
to experience more severe
symptoms than they normally
would.
Dr. Kenneth Smith at
Oklahoma State University said
the Student Health Center
experiences approximately a 25
percent increase in patients with
allergy and asthma symptoms
every spring.
Asthma affects 12 million to
15 million Americans. Asthma
may occur at any age, but it’s
more common in people under
the age of 40, according to the
Diagnosis: Asthma Web site.
Sophomore Megan Harback
said she knew spring was on the
way when her itchy eyes, runny
nose, shortness of breath and
headaches began.
Harback has suffered from
asthma and allergies since she
was 2 years old. She said her
main allergies are pollen, mold,
ragweed and dust.
Sometimes getting through a
typical spring day without
wheezing or constant nose
blowing is not easy for students
like Harback.
Harback said she wakes
every spring morning and takes
two inhalers for her asthma and

one allergy pill to prepare for the
activities of the day, like getting
to class.
Wind not only makes it
harder to walk, but it also makes
it harder to breathe, she said. The
wind increases her shortness of

trees are typically budding,”
Smith said. “As that starts to
diminish, then you see the grass
pollen start to take off and that’s
usually later spring. And then
after that, you start to see the
weed pollen.

If you are allergic to Bermuda
grass, unless you live in a plastic
bubble, it's going to be kind o f hard

to get away from it. ”

breath, and her breathing can
be worsened by walking by
someone who is smoking.
“I walk to class and smokers
do bother me. When there is
smoke, I always have to rush and
walk around in front of them. I
don’t like walking behind them
because the smoke blows in your
face,” Harback said.
Nighttime symptoms often
cause Harback the biggest
problems.
“My asthma flares up more
at nighttime,” she said. “During
the night, I always have to get up
and take my inhaler at least
once.”
Harback’s daily routine is
similar to what many students
experience during the spring.
Smith said the main component
of spring that causes allergies and
asthma to flare up is pollen.
“Typically early in the
spring, you are going to see an
increase in the tree pollen
because that’s when the

“The body perceives the
pollen as foreign, so it mounts an
immune response like it would
for a virus or bacteria,” Smith
said.
The side effects of allergies
and asthma can cause immediate
discomfort.
Some
common
effects are sneezing watery
eyes, itchy nose,
shortness of breath,
wheezing and coughing
People
who
were at least 18
years old and
employed missed 11.8
million workdays in
2002 due to asthma,
according
to
the
National

; o ,

Center for Health Statistics Web
site.
Smith said several natural
remedies may help prevent
allergies and asthma attacks.
“First, if you can identify
what it is you are allergic to, try
to avoid those things. And that’s
kind of the bottom line,” Smith
said.
Changing the air filters,
washing the sheets more often
and frequently dusting are some
of the household precautions
students can take to help reduce
asthma and allergy symptoms.
Smith said investing in an air
filtration system might also help
students.
“If you’re allergic to pollen,
although it’s unfortunate, close
up the house and use the filtration
system of your central heat and
air,” Smith said. “Try to avoid

opening the windows and letting
all the fresh air and pollen in.”
Another natural way to treat
asthma and allergies is by
drinking water.
According to the Global
Health Solutions Web site, Dr. F.
Batmanghelidj said allergies and
asthma can actually be the body’s
way of alerting people of its
urgent need for water.
These natural treatments
may not always be enough to
treat asthma and allergies, but
they can definitely help people
breathe more easily during the
springtime.
“If you are allergic to
Bermuda grass, unless you live in
a plastic bubble, it’s going to be
kind of hard to get away from it,
Smith said. “So then that’s where
medications come in to help just
alleviate the symptoms.”
Smith also said there are
good treatments available to
students so they are not
completely miserable every time
spring comes around.

“We were interested in
having him speak because of
how he used his winnings for the
betterment of society, and how
he incorporated soccer with it
since he was formerly a
professional playet,” CAB
graduate adviser Alyssa Bodeux
said.
Zohn used his milliondollar winnings to create
Grassroot Soccer, a foundation
that incorporates soccer into
teaching children in Africa the
seriousness of the AIDS crisis.
His program is titled
“Character. The Ultimate Survival

Some of St. Louis’ most
talented soccer players are
gearing up for Soccer Fest,
hosted by the SIUE men’s soccer
team Sunday at Eagan Center
Field in Florissant, Mo.
Men’s soccer head coach Ed
Huneke said the team is putting
on the event in an effort to raise
money for the team’s scholarship
program. This is the first year for
the event, and the team hopes for
a good turnout from soccer fans.
“Our alumni is fairly active,
so that part doesn’t worry me,”
Huneke said.
There will be three games
Sunday, all of which are free to
attend. There will also be prizes
and a barbeque.
While raising money for the
team, the event will also ensure a
long-lasting relationship between
the Scott Gallagher Soccer Club
and SIUE, who have had a close
relationship for years.

Thomas Howe, an SIUE
soccer team alumnus, helped
coach for the Scott Gallagher
Soccer Club, and SIUE has
had numerous players from the
club continue their soccer careers
at the university. Soccer Fest
will aim to recognize and
continue
this
bond
The first game will start at
12:30 p.m. and will see
club athletes under 18 facing
the Florissant Cougars under
18.
The first game will be
followed by a match between
Scott Gallagher and SIUE
alumni. The day will close with
SIUE taking on the University of
Missouri-Kansas City.
“They are a Division I
team,” Huneke said. “We’re
capable of playing with most
Division I teams, so it should be a
close game.”
The Cougars have continued
their success from last fall
and are 3-0 in the spring
season.

looming large at the end of May,
SIUE is trying to work out all the
kinks.
“People are still tired from
training. People are not in their
right events,” McAllister said.
“We’re
working
through
these meets to get to the big
meets.”
“I don’t
think
w e’re
ready yet,” Bannister added. “But
I think (we should be) ready by
the
time
the
conference

tournament comes around. We
should be peaking by that time.
Right now, a lot of people aren’t
running their best times.”
Next up, SIUE hosts its first
home event o f the season with the
Cougar Classic Saturday at the
Korte Stadium.
“It’s our biggest home meet
of the year,” Beyers said. “We’ll
be showcasing what we do
every week w e ’re away, so
it’s good to be home.”

Women s tennis ends 20042005 season on high note

S po r ts R e po r t e r

The SIUE women’s tennis
team took four o f five matches
during spring play to end the
2004-05 season with an overall
record of 9-7 after going 5-6 in
the fall 2004 campaign.
The Cougars were led by
senior Chrissy Yingst, who
earned an All-Great Lakes Valley
Conference selection. Yingst
finished the season 11-6 in the
No.l slot and teamed with senior
Allison Coats to finish 9-8 in
doubles play.
Katherine Ferry, the lone
freshman, finished the season
with a 6-6 record in the No. 6
position. Ferry had to make the
transition from being the N o.l
seed in high school to the No.6
spot at SIUE.
“It was different from
playing in high school,” Ferry
said. “I wasn’t really expecting

anything because it was my first
year playing on a college-level
tennis team. People took it more
seriously.”
Ferry said she expects to
move up in the lineup next year
when Yingst and Coats leave the
program and the top spots open
up.
Junior Celia Montes proved
she could move up successfully.
Montes had a 6-8 record in the
No. 5 spot, but when she
advanced to the No. 4 spot, she
finished 2-1.
“We had our ups and
downs,” Montes said. “We were
hoping to finish a little higher, but
we weren’t upset with the way we
finished. The wins I did get, I was
happy with.”
Three players on the team
gained Academic All-American
honors. Ferry, Coats and Montes
made the grade as each carried a
grade point average of at least
3.30.

or the Cougars, which involves
the pitching threesome of
DeShasier, freshman right-hander
Lindsey Laas and junior lefty
Casey Wantland. After the
sweeps, they have compiled a
2.49 ERA over 200 innings
pitched and hold the offense to a
.253 batting average. DeShasier
leads the staff in wins with 11,
followed by Laas and her 10
wins. However, Wantland leads
the staff with a miniscule 1.63
ERA.
Although Montgomery said
she is now satisfied with the
pitching since it was questionable
at the beginning of the season,
she said she feels there is still
more work to be done.
“We still have a long way to
go,” Montgomery said
in
reference to the pitchers. “They

are not the most dominating, but
they are doing their job, and that
is all you can ask out of them.”
For
Montgomery,
the
winning streak is nice, but she
said she does not believe that
should be the focus when SIUE
takes the field against the
University of Southern Indiana.
“The winning streak is all
that the media talks about,”
Montgomery said. “We only have
a target on our backs because of
our past successes and our
national ranking. Anybody we
play is after us.”
The Cougars look to improve
even further on their 28-8 record
and undefeated 6-0 Great Lakes
Valley Conference record when
they go up against the Screaming
Eagles at 3 p.m. Thursday in
Evansville, Ind.
