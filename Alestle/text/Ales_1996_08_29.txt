Chancellor Nancy Belck addresses the crowd Wednesday at the third annual convocation.

C hancellor Belck packed in a crowd of over 2,000 students,
faculty and staff W ednesday with her convocation speech
which reflected on the changes on campus and ^he challenges
of the university.
Belck began h er third annual convocation speech,
“W ithstanding the Winds of C hange,” by discussing some of
the accom plishm ents that the university has achieved in the
past year.
Belck began her speech by com paring a pine tre e ’s roots,
which are not buried deep into the ground and allow the tree
to fall over, to that of the redwood tree, which although has
the same type of shallow burial, does not stand alone and is
held up by the rest of the redw oods around it which support
each other through connecting their roots.
In describing this story of the pine and the redwoods, Belck
called the audience to becom e like the redw oods and “stand
together.”
B elck th en w ent on to reflect on som e of the
accom plishm ents th at SIU E has achieved over the past few
years and describe w here we are headed as a university in the
future.
Belck said th at one of th e g re atest academ ic
accomplishments of the university was the form ation of the
nurse practitioner program that began this fall. She also said
that with the com m itm ent of the faculty at S IU E , the
undergraduate program s as well have greatly improved.
“We have accom plished much in the way of academic
accom plishm ents,” Belck said. “High school teachers nation
wide are telling their students th at o u r undergraduate
program s are the key strength of Southern Illinois University
at Edwardsville.”
Belck went on to m ention that another accom plishm ent of
the university is the closer ties betw een Academ ic Com puting

No budget? A matter of miscommunication
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
A t last F riday’s student governm ent meeting,
Student Vice-President Jam es Little inform ed the
student body that O IT (Office of Inform ation and
Technology) possibly had not been operating under
a budget for seven years. Now the issue betw een
Little and the director of OIT, Cheryl Strackeljahn
might have been a miscommunication.
In a telephone conversation Tuesday afternoon,
Strackeljahn explained what her office is currently
operating under.
“ We have always operated under a budget. We

acknowledged that the problem derived from the
difference between budget and expenses.
“T he problem came from Cheryl talking about
expenses ab o u t the telephone services— not
budgets,” Little said.
The expenses of which O IT are currently trying to
resolve stems betw een those related to fraud and
daily operating expenses.
“W hat I told Jam es (Little) was that we needed a

inform ation from our past budgets,” Strackeljahn
said.
Strackeljahn also explained th at work was being
done by Dr. Stanford Levin, a professor in the
economics departm ent.
“Dr. Levin is currently working with a senior
project to create a budget for adm inistrative charges
for p h o n e services and fixing eq u ip m en t,”
Strackeljahn said.
Strackeljahn also m entioned that O IT is working
on providing long-distance services for students on
campus. W ith the services, the university could
charge students for long-distance at lower rates than
commercial long-distance companies.

California ends aid to illegal
immigrants

Demonstrators picket outside designated areas

SACREM ENTO — California’s governor signed an executive order
Tuesday directing state agencies and state-supported colleges and
universities to stop benefits to all illegal immigrants.
Pete Wilson, a Republican, described his executive order as “the first
step in implementing federal welfare reform.” His office has not
provided details exactly which benefits might be cut off but Wilson did
say the order would not affect emergency medical Services and that he
would ask the state legislature to enact laws that would continue to
provide care for sick illegal immigrants for “transitional purposes
only.”

CHICAGO — Protesters bypassed city-sanctioned
protest sites and spread throughout the city to deliver
their messages. Anti-abortion protesters closed down a
West Side clinic while AIDS activists heckled the first
lady at a Loop appearance.
“We are not going to subject ourselves to an enforced
event,” AIDS activist Wayne Turner said.
The American Civil Liberties Union tried to have a
federal judge ease restrictions on a designated
demonstration site across form the convention center.
The city was ordered to set up the site after several
groups complained that official protest sites were so far
away from delegates as to be virtually useless.

LONDON — Seven Iraqis seeking political asylum freed 184
hostages after a 16-hour drama ended .Tuesday at Stansted Airport.
Exile groups suggested the hijackers might be Iraqi government
military advisers too frighten by Sadam Hussein’s purges to return
home. The hijackers took over Sudan Airways Flight 150 and
surrendered after seven hours of negotiations. Police met one key
demand and brought in Iraqi Community Association leader Saddiq
Saddah, known for helping exiles and refugees.
Stansted is Britain’s designated airport for highjackings because it is
small and surrounded by open countryside. There were no injuries
during the highjacking.

EAST ST. LOUIS — East St. Louis schools opened as

The teacher’s union asked employees to show up for
work Tuesday even though the district has not officially
rehired 31 teachers and about 70 teachers’ aides. The
district began the year without several key

elementary school principal and two assistant principals.

FACT SHEET:

command. I no longer call you servants...I
have called you friends. (John 15:14-15)
This letter is a continuation of my rebuttal
to Professor A ndris’ letter.
Now allow me to address a few topics you
brought up in your letter such as questionable
dietary practices. By the grace of G od we may
eat any food if we give thanks.

They forbid people to marry and order
them to abstain from certain foods, which God
created to be received with thanksgiving by
those who believe and who know the truth. For
everything God created is good and nothing is
to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
because it is consecrated by the word o f God
and prayer. (1 Timothy 4:4-5)
And polygamy? Sir, Christians were the
ones who m ade m onogam y a law in the
U.S.A. and it w asn’t a result of “m odern
thought.”

Now the overseer must be above reproach,
the husband o f but one wife... (1 Timothy 3:2)
A deacon must be the husband o f but one
wife... (1 Timothy 3:2)
You suggest th at the Bible asserts that
w om en and ch ildren are the p ro p erty
(‘chattel’) of their husbands.

You are all sons o f God through faith in
Christ Jesus. There is neither Jew nor Greek,
slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all
one in Christ Jesus. (Galatians 3:26,28)
The husband is the head of the family just
as Christ is the head of the church and his
responsibility is to love and care for his family
just as Christ loves and cares for the church.
This doesn’t allow them to be treated as m ere
property because Jesus treats us as friends:

W hat about religious wars?

For though we live in the world, we do not
wage war as the world does. The weapons we
fight with are not the weapons o f the world. On
the contrary, they have divine power to
demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments
and every pretension that sets itself up against
the knowledge o f God and we take captive
every thought to make it obedient to Christ. (2
Corinthians 10:3-5)
We fight a spiritual battle, not a physical
one.
O ur w eapons are salvation,
righteousness, peace, faith, truth and the word
of G od which is the Bible:

A ll Scripture is God-breathed and is useful
fo r teaching, rebuking, correcting and training
in righteousness, so that the man o f God may
be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
(2 Timothy 3:16-17).
I honor both G od and the Bible. O r should
we as Christians stand idly by watching a
great n atio n continually sink into m oral
decline—one thing that contributed to the
decline of the Rom an Em pire? We are in a
dem ocracy and I thank G od for that. We are
using the dem ocratic process to preserve the

Victoria Vasileff takes over as student legal Counsel
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
W hen a legal pro b lem crops up,
stu d en ts have a friend in V ictoria
Vasileff, S IU E ’s new legal counsel at
Student Legal Services. Vasileff has been
on board since May and replaces Sandra
Dods.
V asileff received a b a c h e lo r’s in
speech com m unications from University
of M issouri and h er Jurist D octorate
from W ashington U niversity’s School of
Law. E xcept for one year w hen she
w orked for the 1RS, she has been in
private practice since 1988.
Student Legal Services was initiated
by student governm ent about 16 years
ago. Students who are currently enrolled
at S IU E and have paid tuition and fees
are entitled to use the services.
“No individual hands me any m oney,”

Vasileff said. “I have students say, ‘You’re
free,’ but really I’m not. Your student
fees pay for the legal services.”
Vasileff said m any people d o n ’t
understand what family law entails. That
category includes adoption, divorce, child
custody cases and those involving
visitation and su p p o rt and orders of
p ro tectio n . In short, “A nything th at
pertains to the family,” Vasileff said.
C ourthouse safety has been in the
news lately because of the August 12

divorce and custody case. M adison
C ounty Circuit C ourt Judge A nn CallisRongey presided over the case.
Vasileff didn’t know Meyer, but she is
acquainted Callis-Rongey who took a
tem porary leave of absence and went into
hiding because she is considered a

possible target of the killer’s anger.
“I t’s always a chance you take but I
feel safe at the courthouse. The deputies
there are very aware of what goes on.
T hey’re always on the alert for body
language o r conversations th at may
signal trouble,” Vasileff said.
There are restrictions what kind of
case Vasileff can tak e on. She isn ’t
authorized to handle m atters involving
one student suing another; students suing
any official at SIU E, including Student
G overnm ent; cases involving crim inal
m atters; and several o th er types of
consum er law.
“I ’ve been surprised with the stuff
students have brought in that do fit under
our legal services. It’s just amazing how
much I can do for students,” she said.

And the survey
shows: SIUE
students
making
healthy choices
By Betty Lawton, Wellness
Program Coordinator
For the Alestle
C ollege stu d en ts are
com m only perceived as
heavy
drin k ers
and
“partyers.” However, after
reviewing the results of the
1996 C O R E A lcohol and
D rug Survey, S IU E can
claim th at this perception
does not typically apply to
their students.
The statistics below show
th at th e vast m ajority of
S IU E
stu d en ts
m ake
healthy choices regarding
drugs and alcohol.
• 72% have not used
marijuana in the past year
• 83% stated they would
not want drugs available at a
party
• 61% reported no binge
drinking within the past two
weeks
• 60% have not used
tobacco products in the past
year
N ot only does society
view college stu d en ts as
heavy
d rin k ers,
S IU E
stu d en ts
also
perceive
inflated alcohol and drug
use am ong fellow students.
S urveyed
stu dents
thought that 60 percent of
their peers currently used
m arijuana, w hen actually
only 22 p ercen t re p o rted
current use of the drug.
In regards to alcohol,
over 90 percent believe that
the average SIU E student
used alcohol once a week or
m ore, w hereas only 37.9
p ercen t actually re p o rted
these drinking habits.
T h ese
statistics
may
encourage us to rethink our
opinion or th e “typical”
college student.
Responsible drinking or
abstinence decreases health
risks
and
o th er
risk
com m only associated with
alcohol
and
drug
m isuse/abuse
such
as
decreases in grades or
increases in injuries, legal
problem s and relationship
problem s.
Since
the
m ajority of SIU E students
indicate a responsible and
healthy lifestyle, they are
attem p tin g to m ake the

Usually a lawyer will take one-third of a settlem ent; these are

as an adult education instructor, helping students learn to take

Entertainment
E n te rta in m e n t, a r t mesh in new a rth o u se film
By Greg Levrault
For the Alestle
Movie review
“ Basquiat”
Opens Aug. 30

(☆☆☆☆ out o f 4)

Som etim es, m ovies try to be entertaining;
sometimes, movies try to be art. True, som e movies
aspire to be both, but th ere’s usually one overriding
preferen ce. M ovies can easily be entertaining:
w hatever sights and spectacles m ake the blood race
and the heart sigh. Movies tell you how to feel, and
you can go along with it.
Movies as art is an uphill battle. With a painting or
a poem , the creator is the sole voice and does
everything in his o r her pow er to m ake certain that
the intended m essage gets through. Movies are
co n certed efforts, o f crow ds of peo p le in all
capacities. Paintings and poetry are not required to
connect with their audience; these kinds of work can
stand alone and work on a personal level. Movies, on
the o th er hand, have to offer som ething to the
audience, an experience shared at a com m unal level.
W henever movies began, few people considered
their artistic potential. Today, the m odern painter
and poet try to be like movie stars.
That is the prem ise of “ Basquiat,” an independent
film about the life of New York artist, Jean-M icheal
B asquiat. B asq uiat was an ‘80s New York art

sensation, a close friend of Andy Warhol, one of
M adonna’s boyfriends, and the portrait of an artist’s
lifestyle. H e begins the m ovie in a
cardboard box, m aking art with graffiti
and m aple syrup. He has friends, gets a
girlfriend, and lives the B ohem ian
lifestyle. H e gets fam ous and grows
adept at personal politics, losing his
friends in the process.
“B asq u iat” was w ritten by th ree
form er bandm ates of the artist. The
movie portrays him as a person trying to
be an artist, trying to be famous, and
trying to be heard. Being an art film,
“B asquiat” has several speeches and
visual cues about the subject, from the
perceived rom ance of Van G o g h ’s
lifestyle to the dream about the prince
in the tower.
“B asquiat” is an arthouse film in all
the popular ways as well. It has great
perform ances from actor’s actors, such
as Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper,
Michael Wincott, and Gary Oldman. It
has appearances from up-and-com ers
like Parker Posey, Benicio Del Toro,
and Claire Forlani. It has Courtney Love
as the “other w om an” and David Bowie
as A ndy W arhol. It has those
m om entary film gaffes th at are
im possible to ignore
(look for the falling
boom mike). It also has
a
cool,
integral
soundtrack
of
‘80s
u nderground
rock
(Pogues, B ush Tetras,
Iggy Pop).

Is she the one?

The film w orks because of Jeff Wright, who
portrays Basquiat. Basquiat doesn't fall because of
drugs, or fame, or
even naivete about
how the real world
works.
B asquiat
w ants
to
be
recognized for his
w ork, and
th at
am bition fuels his
life. Wright gives a
subdued, balanced,
c h a r m e d
perform ance,
so
that even the beerdrinking public can
identify w ith the
artist.
“B asq u iat”

arth o u se
shuffle
b e t w e e n
“Trainspotting”
fervor

m ade it to the big
screen this time.
The subject m atter
certainly keeps this
movie from m aking it to m ainstream theaters. But
people who like to watch a good story about a
hum an being will like “ Basquiat.” The movie doesn’t
intend to sentim entalize or sym pathize with all of
Jean-M icheal B asquiat’s actions. Instead, it tries to
do what he tried to do in life: It gives Basquiat
recognition for what he was— an artist.

Movie review
“She’s the O ne”
Currently showing
“She’s the One,” starring Jennifer Aniston of “Friends,” opened at theaters
on Friday, Aug. 23. It was billed a rom antic comedy. The movie is entertaining
in a soap opera-ish way. However, som eone seems to have forgotten to add in
a plot, a story line and a climax.
The movie opens with a family on a fishing trip: Micky (a New York cab ■
driver), M icky’s brother Frances (a Wall Street businessm an), and the
bro th ers’ retired father. T hroughout the movie, the father listens to his sons
and gives advice, all the while believing that M icky’s wife is an illegal
im m igrant and th at Frances is a closet homosexual.
By chance, M ickey picks up H ope in his cab. She convinces him to drive her
to Louisiana for a wedding. Twenty-four hours later, Micky and H ope are
m arried.
Back in New York, R enee (portrayed by Jennifer A niston) is whining
because h er husband (Frances) refuses to have sex with her. This appears to
be her entire role in the movie. Eventually, R en ee’s father suggests that
Frances is a hom osexual. By the time that rum or gets around, even Frances’
father is convinced o f his son’s wrongly-perceived sexual preference.
In reality, R enee is just too slow to pick up on the fact that Frances is
actually having an affair. A nd th e mistress is none other than H eather, who is
M icky’s ex-fiancee.
Not long after Micky and H ope return to New York, Micky picks up
H eath er in his cab. H eath er adm its to Micky that she is having an affair with

Imagine yourself throw n onto an island of paradise, only to find that it is a
societal nightmare. This is the case in the film, “The Island o f Dr. Moreau.” The
main character, Edw ard Douglas (David Thewlis), is an unsuspecting captive
on the island. His captors are a geneticist, Dr. M oreau (Marlon Brando), and
the doctor’s assistant M ontgom ery (Val Kilmer). Douglas finds out quickly
that M oreau is experim enting with gene-splicing when he sees the “manbeasts” on the island.
The story basically deals with hum anity and its strive for perfection, but it
stresses the fact that no one should ignore nature. The perform ances in this
film are favorable. Thewlis does an excellent job as Douglas. B rando is
extraordinary, as usual, in this adoption of H.G. Wells’ novel of the same name.
The only perform ance that is not too impressive is that of Kilmer: H e never
achieves believability.
To add to the perform ance of the actors, the special effects and m ake-up
m ake the movie, as a whole, believable. Stan W inston and his staff (“Alien”
and
“ Predator” )
created
the
hairy
“m an -b easts”
with accuracy. They had the help of Digital D om ain (special effects), which was
founded by James Cam eron.
“The Island of Dr. M oreau” is a recom m ended film for those interested. It
definitely is a horrifying look at what happens when nature is disturbed. The
film is very fast-paced and could have developed the characters in a m ore
exacting way, but it still displayed the overall m eaning of the story.
Overall, “The Island of Dr. M oreau” kept my attention, and it was enjoyable.
Grade-wise, I give it a B. H ope you enjoy it.

Eventually, at the end of the movie, the roles are reversed. Frances ends up with nothing but a broken heart, and Micky appears

"She’s the O n e” is funny, but it is strictly for those who d o n ’t want to think about it. It would have been much m ore

Friendship ain't pretty:
"Walking' finds laughs in reality of friendships
By Greg Levrault
For the Alestle
Movie review
“ Walking and Talking”
Currently showing

(☆☆1/2 o f 4)

Hollywood likes to m ake things loud, which is why movies
about friendship usually suck.Television is better suited to show
the nuances, the subtleties, the dam n hard work that goes into
friendship. M oviem akers and moviegoers like explosions of any
kind; so cinem atic friendships get littered with death and war,
adulterous affairs, fatal betrayals, Christmas reunions, high
school football games, and new born babies. The Big Fight; the
Big Cry; the Big Hug: T h at’s the Hollywood way. But not all
friendships are like that.
“Walking and Talking” is the M olierian tale of two buddies
and what happens when one decides to get m arried. Laura is a
therapy student who decides to accept a m arriage proposal.
H er friend A m elia is a therapy patient w ho’s ready to resign to
renting videos every night for the rest of her life. Laura starts to
get cold feet and puts her boyfriend’s every flaw under the
microscope. Am elia finds herself accepting a date with the
chainsaw-movie-loving video clerk, who her friends call “the
Ugly Guy.” L aura finds herself fantasizing about patients.
A m elia finds herself hanging out with h er ex-boyfriend,
Andrew, who possesses a peculiar addiction. The cat dies. And
everybody m isunderstands everybody else.
The movie rem inded me of a couple of friends I have right
now, who have huge m isunderstandings about each other. They
used to talk to each other, but then they let o th er people’s
gossip weigh m ore than their own conversations with each other
and ... well, 1 w on’t bother you with the rest. The point is this:
People m isunderstand each other. O ur words go through static,
and people hear the wrong words, if anything at all. It’s sad, but
it’s true. A nd sometimes, it’s funny.
“W alking” is the first film by director Nicole Holofcener, and
it is a story about two girls. Having said that, to call “Walking
and Talking” a ‘chick’ movie is like calling “Friends” a ‘chick’
TV. show. Am elia and L aura aren ’t having ‘girl’ problems;
they’re having the same problem s guys have. “W alking” watches
like a John Hughes teen movie that grew up with you. The cast
isn ’t too pretty, too loud, to o cool o r uncool— all the
perform ances keep the movie at its best.
“W alking” has a familiar story, but the quiet touch and funny
twists m ake the movie seem m ore like a series of anecdotes
shared at a high school reunion. The stories are all absurd, and
they’re funny, because you know what they were thinking.
A nyone looking for a break from this giant special effect of a
sum m er finally has a movie to watch. “W alking” m akes a good
date movie, if you’re already going steady. Watching by yourself,
“W alking” is still pretty funny. Maybe, “W alking” will remind
you of those friends you haven’t heard from in a while but still
think of as friends anyway.

Head tennis coach Bill Logan watches his team do wind sprints

Going into his third season
as head coach of the SIU E
tennis program , Bill Logan is
bringing experience into a
program full of tradition.
“I love the sport and it was

such an honor to be asked to
take over a program th at was
rich in tradition,” Logan said
W ednesday afternoon.
Logan started his career in
teaching the art of tennis in
the Army.
H e ran the fifth Infantry

Soccer preparing for University of Missouri-Rolla
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The S IU E M en’s Soccer team
has not played the University of
M issouri-R olla for over ten
years.
T he C ougars finally have
U M -R olla on their schedule and
will kick off the season in the
H om ecom ing gam e against
them on Saturday at 8 p.m.
H ead coach E d H uneke said
W ednesday m orning, “We are in
for a new experience.
I’m
anticipating a challenge from
R olla even though we haven’t
played them for a long time.”
The C ougars have been
w orking h a rd on defense all
throughout the pre-season, but
find it im portant to get their
offense going early.
Figuring into the offensive
attack will be ju n io r forw ard
D a rren Snyder from W ichita,
Kansas. G ra n ite City ju n io r
Jason M axfield and sophom ore
M ark M axim from B elleville

should also contribute in the
scoring.
Sophom ores Jake Ashley of
St. Louis and Todd H unter of St.
Peters, Mo. will be in the m id­
field for the pioneer game of the
season. B oth are seeing the m id­
field as a new position because
of personnel changes from last
year. Ashley was in the backfield
and H u n ter was a forward.
O n the o th er side of the ball,
senior Steve Van D yke of
Collinsville will be a key player
in the backfield.
“I like the way everyone is
starting to gel,” said Huneke.
“This gam e will be a good
indicator to see how we will do
against M ercyhurst.”
T he
C ougars will face
M ercyhurst in th eir second
contest of the season on
M onday at home. M ercyhurst
was nationally ranked last year
and should be even tougher this
season.
“We
have
som e
very
challenging gam es com ing up
early in the season, but I think
th at w e’ll do well,” said H uneke.

in , the

fo u rth w eek to
boost their spirits.
L ast year Illinois h ad som e
optim ism m ainly because of their
defense. A nd why shouldn’t we have
beep optimistic ,with having the two
best linebackers in the nation?
U nfortunately, it seem ed the

offense gave up m ore points than the
defense.
They started the season off at hom e
against Michigan last year and they
were beat really bad. Now Michigan,
once again, has a good team . A nd of
course, Illinois isn’t any better than
last year. So it’s going to take a miracle
for Illinois to com e out alive in
Michigan.
But like all dedicated fans, I’ll be
close to the television screen yelling

w ondering what they were thinking
when they called that play.
A nd after the game I’ll be hearing
how good Michigan is by good friend
Joe Turck. A nd I ’ll just tell him they
beat a mediocre team and leave it at
that.

ATTENTION STUDENTS:

Logan the job to coach the
tennis p rogram which p ro ­
duced 7 m en national titles
and 4 wom en titles.
A t the tim e L ogan was
hired, the SIU E tennis p ro ­
gram was in a bit of a slump
and needed to be
rejuvenated.
A nd not to o far after
Logan took the job, the m en’s
team w ent on to win the
regional title in O klahom a
and qualified with 15 other
team s for the national tourna­
ment.
T hen ju st last fall, he
coached the w om en’s team to
th e G re at L akes Valley
C onference C ham pionship
their first year in the
conference.
“This was a special time for
us because it was our first
year in the conference and I
really felt p ro u d for the
University because up till last
year the w om en’s team hadn’t
won very much since their last
national title and I was proud
to be the coach,” Logan said.
A lso in th at y ear he
received Coach of the Year
honors for w om en’s tennis.
Logan loves the gam e of
tennis and loves to pass his
experience down to his
players.
