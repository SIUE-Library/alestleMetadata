Terrific, timely tips to minimize manic midterm test terrors
BY KELLY SPARKS
I IFESTYI.F. STRINGER
Midterms are here and just in
time to help you get ready here
are some study tips courtesy of
academic adviser Tricia Martino.
Don’t despair, but the first tip
is: “My advice is to keep up all
along,” Martino said.
M artino also said it is

important to keep up with the
reading and to always prepare for
class. Good attendance is also
very important, she added.
W hen you are in class,
M artino said you should take
good notes and try to form study
groups. A nother person may
know something that you do not
or vice versa. Always take

advantage of what is out there for
you, she said.
The average adult attention
span is
approxim ately 40
minutes, M artino said. W hen
studying, you should take
frequent breaks. Either take a
walk, call a friend or find some
diversion to take your mind off of
studying. Then come back to
what you are studying with a

clear mind. Always study in short
intervals and use your time
wisely, Martino advised.
For all of the procrastinators,
the best advice is to not cram for
m idterm s. You should always
study ahead o f time, but not too
early so that you don’t lose the
information from your short-term
memory. Also, do not memorize.
Instead, Martino said, learn and

comprehend what you are going
to be tested on.
Martino added that if you
think you have a problem with
anything that may be covered, be
sure to ask the instructor.
“M y final big tip is to stay
healthy, get sleep and do not
party too much, but still give
yourself
tim e
for
leisure
activities.”

Diversity forum brings people closer
together through video conference
BY CORY PITT
NEWS STRINGER
A recent nationwide survey
reveals that A m erican citizens
value the importance of diversity
and cultural education training at
the college level in hopes of
creating a better society.
The survey results, revealed
at a live video press conference
shown at the SIU E Lovejoy
Library recently, show ed an
overwhelming concern of those
surveyed with gender and racial
issues in A m erica’s higher
education institutions. Twentynine people at SIUE, as well as
thousands across the country
viewed the results at the same
time.
The survey included ju st
over 2,000 participants of all age
groups, races, political stances
and other factors. The poll,

sponsored by the Association of
A m erican
C olleges
and
U niversities and the Ford
Foundation’s Cam pus Diversity
Initiatives, consisted o f 26
questions, and exam ined such
issues
as
diversity
in
neighborhoods, schools and in
the workplace. It also called for
opinions on how well Americans
cope with cultural differences
today and predictions o f what lies
ahead for all citizens in an
increasingly diverse society.
The results, revealed at the
conference broadcast from the
University of M ichigan, were in
contrast to what was projected.
Vast majorities o f people fully
support diversity training and all
program s that fall under the
objective of teaching different
kinds of people to learn to work
and live together without fear or
prejudice.

“We’ve still got a long way
to go,” said R udy W ilson,
assistant provost for cultural and
social
diversity
at
SIUE,
following the show ing of the
press conference.
“This shows the importance
o f cultural education at the
university level as we move
tow ards a more diverse 21st
century,” Wilson said.
Wilson heads many diversity
training program s at SIUE,
including Pathways to Harmony,
a program to train university
faculty and staff in issues
involving race, gender, disability
and sexual orientation. The Ford
Foundation recently named SIUE
as one of an elite number of
schools that im plem ent such
program s to prom ote new
attitudes and opportunities to
help bring society closer.

‘Rudy-American,’ that’s what I am, says SlUE’s
diversity chair; he practices what he preaches

BY CORY PITT
NEWS STRINGER
Diversity can be a tough part
of the college experience.
Students who attend a university
such as SIUE are exposed to
many types of people. Diversity
on cam pus is a reflection of
diversity in society, and nobody
knows the subject better than
Rudy Wilson.
Wilson, 63, is the Assistant
Provost for Cultural and Social
Diversity at SIUE. He heads a
program known as “Pathways to
Harm ony,”
to
incorporate
diversity training for faculty and
staff in an attempt to fight off
possible problem s involving
diversity.
“We need to create for our
students a sense o f why it’s
im portant
to
have
an
understanding
of
different
cultures in order to survive,” said
Wilson, who has served in his
position for well over a -year.
“Learning about and appreciating
each other is w hat is needed to
live with one another.”
Wilson has spent his whole
life learning about other people.
He grew up in R iver Rouge,
Mich., just outside o f suburban
Detroit. R aised by a Polish

woman after his m other’s death
when he was only five years
old, W ilson attended college
in California and taught English
in Okinawa, Japan, during a
two-year stint in the Army. He
also worked on a sabbatical
with children on a Sioux
Indian reservation near Mount
Rushmore.
W ilson cam e to teach at
SIUE in 1969 and served for 18
years on the Edwardsville school
board. Six o f those years he
served as president, and was the
first A frican A m erican in
Edw ardsville history to be
elected into any office. He also
works as a federal government
consultant for drug and alcohol
awareness, and has trained SIUE
administrators on how to identify
and help students with alcohol
and drug problems.
In 1997, W ilson began his
work as coordinator for SIUE
diversity
training.
W ilson’s
assistant, Liz Tarpey, believes
W ilson’s personality is a key
factor to the success o f Pathways
to Harmony.
“We have gotten so many
positive com m ents on the
program from those faculty and
staff who participated,” she said.
“I think Rudy is the perfect
person to help everyone deal with
such tough issues because o f the
ideas and personality he brings
into it.”
Wilson deals with diversity
both in the workplace and at
home. He and Laverne, his wife
of 29 years, have four children,
three of whom are adopted. In
addition, two of his children have
married a spouse of a different
race of their own.
“I really have a multicultural

fam ily,” W ilson said. “M ost
people cannot say that.”
W ilson
has
had
the
background and experience to
deal with all types of people. He
feels the most important step for
others to learn about other people
is to separate themselves from
their discrim inations. He is
surprised to talk to many people
who still are not fam iliar or
com fortable with people of
different races.
“This one man asked me one
time what he should refer to me
as,” he said. “He asked if he
should call me colored or Negro,
and I said, ‘Why not just call me
Rudy’. Better yet, I told him to
call me ‘Rudy-Am erican.’”
W ilson enjoys his work
because it gives him the
opportunity to meet and work
with all kinds of people.
“In life you should choose
the battles that you know you can
succeed at and win,” he said. “I
feel good about who I am and
what I do, and I think my job
keeps me young.”
v W ilson,
w ith
all
the
experience in diversity and
people skills, would appear to be
a perfect leader for a university to
head towards the 21st century
with a focus on building a
stronger unity among its students.
He believes learning about
diversity all starts with the
children.
“I think kids are our most
valuable asset,” he said. “We
have to work hard as a parent,
teacher, husband and wife for
kids
to
understand
how
wonderful it is to be old. Then
maybe they can stop hurting each
other.”

Letter to the Editor------Human side to the
bookstore went unoticed
In answ er to the Oct. 6
article on the bloodsucking ways
of
the
bookstore,
please
remember:
1) You are attending one of the
few universities that offers
textbook rental for undergraduate
texts. Ask a friend attending
another university what they pay
per semester to purchase all their
texts. You will find many who
spend $200-400 per semester for
books.
2)
Sure, some books are
expensive. We try to obtain
paperback editions o f books
when possible, but we have no
control over publishers’ raising
prices on their products. The
bookstore sells books at the
publisher’s suggested retail price.
3)
We order what your
instructors have asked us to carry.
Some disciplines have books that
are much higher in price than
others - but the faculty feels you
need them for class and/or your
own reference library for future
use(especially graduate level
classes). You may find the same
titled book at a different cost than
the
bookstore’s
copy
but
rem em ber that the one the
bookstore
carries
was
specifically ordered by the
instructors. Occasionally, one
edition of a title may not include
some specific aspect that the
instructor wants - i.e. the
screenplay edition of a novel may
not be the same as original
edition and therefore, the same
title sells at another bookstore for

one-fourth less than the copy at
the bookstore but there is a
difference in the books.
4) If you find the same book,
same edition somewhere else at a
discount, go ahead and purchase
it. No one is twisting your arm
that you have to buy it in the
bookstore. But it does take some
time and work to do so - calling
or going to a variety of stores to
find it, possibly ordering it but
having to pay shipping and
handling charges (the bookstore
does not charge shipping and
handling) and doing so in a
timely manner so that you have
the book by the time your class
starts to use it.
5) We strive to give excellent
customer service - we deal with
the very best of customers but we
also deal with those who feel our
student workers and staff are not
human. Most o f us are either
students ourselves or parents of
college students and graduates.
We know that college is
expensive and stressful, because
w e’ve been there in one aspect or
another. A polite, respectful
customer is a pleasure to serve or
answer questions for, but the
scream ing,
sarcastic,
foulmouthed customer also must be
served. Remember the old adage
- you catch more flies with sugar
than with vinegar Just because
this is your bookstore does not
mean we deserve your behavior.
6) Did you know any profit the
bookstore makes is directly used
to pay off the bonds for the
University Center. It is not used
for huge salaries or parties or any
other such nonsense. It is used to
help support a vital student center

which should
used by all.

and

can

be

7)
The bookstore also is
criticized for our pricing on
school supplies and general
merchandise. It is true that some
lower prices can be found on
school supplies - but we do not
have the advantage of ordering
by hundreds of thousands as the
large discount stored do. We also
try to provide quality items and a
wide variety to suit the needs of
all students and university
community members. Sometimes
it’s convenient to dash into a
bookstore and get just what you
need rather than shopping at three
or four stores, especially if you
do not have transportation. That’s
called convenience.
I don’t condemn your article
but feel that it is worthwhile to
point out aspects of the bookstore
that were not reflected in the
article.
Christy Naylor
Secretary, SIUE Bookstore

Talkin’ dirty

Why is it that University
Center adm inistrators can tell
students to watch their language
because they are using profanity
but teachers have the right to cuss
at students in the classroom?
Shouldn’t the policy be the same
across the board so that no one is
offended? Hopefully, someone
out there has an answer.

Maybe someone out there can relate to me.
At some point in life you are labeled. It usually
happens first with your parents and family, then with your
peers.. You are labeled with a nicknam e or are
continuously reminded about some physical attribute or
personality trait. Your older sisters label you with some
Danielle
potentially embarrassing nickname like “Stinky” because
Belton your room smells. Or you have dimples and everyone just
thinks “that is so cute.” After hearing enough o f this in your life, you
start to develop a bit of a complex. That is my problem; my hair has
given me a complex, in part thanks to all the remarks I’ve heard.
W hen 1 was young 1 thought the discriminating factor between
my two sisters and me was my hair. My hair was the longest and it
was very thick. From the time I was very young to today, I am
constantly reminded of it. Somewhere between my childhood and
now my hair stopped just being my hair and became part of what
defined me. I was always “the girl with the hair.” Just as my oldest
sister, Denise, had been the “happy one” and Deidre was the “cute
one,” I was always the one with the hair.
Hair has always been a big deal in the black community.
Mothers go to great lengths to condition hair and make it grow and
mothers never cut their daughters' hair, no matter how long it gets.
My mother was no different. She labored for hours over our heads
till we all yielded plenty of thick, dark hair. But mine was the
longest. She would take my hair and put it in a braid on each side of
my head. W hen I turned my head, the barrettes on the ends were
deadly weapons that might whip anyone standing too close in the
eye.
My grandparents lavished compliment on top o f compliment
about it. “All that hair,” they would say, “all that beautiful hair,” as
if there was something magical in it. It was like the hair guaranteed
acceptance and success when those words came out o f their mouths.
It was as if the hair were like money in the bank or a guaranteed
husband. It was like just because I have this hair I have all these
possibilities. It wasn’t long before I developed a complex.
I couldn’t cut my hair. In junior high and high school, every
black girl I knew was cutting her hair. Everyone wanted the latest
style. But I was afraid to even comb my hair. I was paranoid that I
would break it off and ruin it. My oldest sister, Denise, had broken
off her hair. I did not want the same fate. People would tell me over
and over, “You’re going to want to cut your hair.” Yet, I didn’t. I was
horrified at the notion. My hair was my beauty; without it, I thought
I would be ugly. No one ever said, “Danielle, what beaunful eyes
you have” or “W hat a lovely smile you have.” It was always the hair.
I felt that the rest of me was ordinary.
Then came sophomore year of high school,, the year 1 broke it
off. I had just discovered the blow dryer and the curling iron. I would
always do my hair in spiral curls or in ponytails. It w asn’t long
before one side of my hair was badly damaged and short and the
other side was riddled with split ends. It had to be cut and for the first
time I couldn't say I had long hair. With short hair I was ordinary,
who wanted to be ordinary? I then became obsessed with growing it
back. I realized it would never be as long as it had been, but it is a
nice length now.
It’s sad, because I never see myself as superficial, but when it
comes to my hair, I can be the pettiest person.
Maybe I wouldn’t care about my hair so much if I didn’t hear so
much about it. People gasp when I get my ends clipped and they
think I’ve cut my hair. Sometimes I think other people watch it
nearly as much as I do. But there’s no way that is possible because I
am constantly in front of mirrors worrying about it. My complex is
so deep that I have dreams about my hair. They involve washing my
hair, then seeing it lying in big clumps in the sink. Or the dreams are
about curling my hair, only for it to come out in the curling iron. In
my dreams I’m going bald, one of my biggest fears.
The people closest to me, those who already know I am
obsessed with my hair, try to convince me that it doesn’t matter. But
the guys I date tell me that if I didn't have the hair they never would
have asked me out in the first place. And every day I see several girls
with hair weaves and extensions to achieve what I was born with.
Therefore I’m always getting mixed messages. The same chorus that
sings to me about acceptance and not listening to what others
consider beautiful is the same chorus that sits in a beautician’s chair
for eight hours to get a weave.
I know that I’m more than a pile of dead cells on my head, but
it’s amazing how something so little as hair can determine whether I
like myself or not. Is it society's fault for putting such an emphasis
on the superficial or my fault for buying into it? If I cut my hair,
perhaps 1 could learn and realize that it is not the determining factor
between m yself and everyone else. But I already know I’m not going
to cut it.
I’ve already put a value on it that I can’t let go of. Besides, I've
always liked being the girl with the long hair even if it’s just
superficial and has nothing to do with who I really am.

Imo’s Pizza is the leader, SIUE volunteers needed to make life
beats others in UC survey better for Fairmount schoolchildren
BY TAMARA S. KANO
NEWS STRINGER
The students cast their
ballots and the winning pizza is
Imo’s.
In early Septem ber, the
U niversity
C en ter’s
D epartm ent o f M arketing
Research conducted a survey to
find out which pizza restaurant
students prefer.
Students w ere asked to
choose their three favorite
restaurants among Pizza Hut,
Im o’s, Papa Jo h n ’s, Pizza
World, Dom ino’s Pizza, Little
Caesar’s and Pantera’s Pizza.
A total o f 172 students
answered the survey and the
top three choices were Im o’s,
Pizza Hut and Papa John’s.
Im o’s received 44.83 percent of
the votes, w hile Pizza Hut
received 32.76 percent and
Papa Jo h n ’s received 22.41
percent.
, A ccording to the UC
Director Mary Robinson, the
survey was conducted as a step
to further improve the services

offered to students by the UC.
“Our main goal is to see
what students want and like,”
Robinson said. “We created
Cougar Den as a late-night
hangout and pizza could be a
good item to offer, but first we
had to know w’hat pizza the
students prefer.”
Although Pizza Hut was
not the top choice, it was still
very highly ranked, and
Robinson said it would be the
most appropriate option to go
with.
How ever at the present
time the SIUE contract with
Pizza Hut only allows for mini
pizzas to be made in the UC.
and does not include delivery.
The new service would
have to include regular-size
pizzas and perhaps delivery.
Robinson said UC officials
would contact Pizza Hut and
try to make ari agreement to
change the contract.
“If Pizza Hut agrees, we
might have the new service by
next semester,” Robinson said.

Tree to be dedicated
to founder on Thursday
The
Founders’
Day
celebration will begin at 11 a.m.
Thursday with the dedication of a
tree in the name of Delyte W.
Morris at the Donal Myer

U niversity
Drive.
Morris was a founder of SIU
and served as president from
1948 to 1971.
After the dedication, there
will be a reception for SIUE
students at 11:30 a.m. in the
Goshen Lounge in the Morris
University Center.
The center will be formally
rededicated in M orris’ name at 2
p.m. Thursday.
The ceremony, which will be
held in the cen ter’s M eridian
Ballroom, will also include the
rededication of the William G.
Stratton
Q uadrangle
and
Founders Hall, which was
formerly Classroom Building II.
A reception will follow the

ceremony. The public is invited.
O fficials will also honor
individuals and organizations that
helped establish the Edwardsville
campus in the late 1950s. Chief
among these will be Morris.
“SIUE w ouldn’t be here
without the vision of Delyte
Morris,” SIUE Chancellor David
Werner said.
Those
attending
the
ceremony will receive free
comm em orative
booklets
containing a pictorial history of
M orris’ years at SIUE from 1957
through 1970. This span includes
his tenures at the East St. Louis
campus and Shurtleff College in
Alton, which later became the
dental school.
The festivities will shift to
Carbondale
Friday
when
President Ted Sanders and other
officials will hold a convocation
service at 1:30 p.m.

Don’t be a dimwit, be smart
conserve energy and recycle
BY ANTOINETTE BERNICH
NEWS STRINGER
October is Energy Awareness
month
at
SIUE.
Energy
awareness
includes
energy
conservation and all efforts to
help save the environment.
Two years ago, SIUE had
26,000 light fixtures replaced
with higher efficiency lighting
units.
“We were able to reduce the
number of fixtures themselves by
50 percent and still raise the
lighting levels at the desktop,”
Jack Butler, associate director for
utilities, said.
That project cost just over $4
million. Butler said the savings
generated
from
the
light
replacement paid for the project.
Currently, the savings are being
put back into the project.
In 1992, the vice chancellor
for adm inistration approved a

mixed office paper recycling
program. From 1993 to 1996,
more than 9,000 trees were saved
thanks to the program.
In an 11-month period, SIUE
can recycle two tons of aluminum
cans. The energy saved is 30,000kilow att hours of electricity.
Please note that when trash is
thrown into the containers, the
loads are contaminated and that
results in a loss for SIUE,
officials said.
University Housing sponsors
its own recycling program, which
has been in operation since 1993.
Recycling containers are in both
residence halls, the Commons
and at locations in the Cougar
Village complex.
SIUE has a 40 percent solid
waste reduction goal to reach
by the year 2000. If everyone
helps, the goal will be reached,
officials said.

Sm okes
H e ig h ts

BY SASHA MASTROIANN1
LIFESTYLES REPORTER

After decades o f smoking marijuana, 60-year-old Tommy
Chong still has what it takes to amuse an audience. Chong,
one h alf o f the comedy duo Cheech and Chong, performed
in fou r shows recently at A rt Vielufs Comedy, Etc. in
Fairview Heights.
Chong took the stage dressed in jeans and a scene, Chong falls asleep and dreams he’s Ralph
hemp T-shirt with a bandanna around his salt- the dog. The embarrassed girl couldn’t keep a
and-pepper hair. Although the wrinkles around straight face as she and Chong were on all fours
his eyes showed his age, his quick wit and on a table, acting like dogs.
Chong’s wife performed before him and
ability made him seem much younger.
Chong performed many of his classic skits helped with some of his skits. She said it was
as well as some newer songs and jokes. He sang great to be married to a stoner because he
and played guitar to a few hilarious songs about thought she was a great cook. She also said that
(what else?) Bill and Monica (“You’d think he he is a great father. He has taught his sons to
could have bought the loud-mouthed bitch a farm on small-scale, closet-sized farms.
Mrs. Chong, at about 40 years old, is a tall,
new dress.”) and M ichael Jackson, (“the
slender blonde. She performed in an ultra-short
dumbest white boy in the world”).
Another highlight was when Chong took a disco ball dress. She came across like a ditzy
young lady from the audience to help him re­ game show host, though she occasionally had
enact a skit from his upcoming movie. In the something funny to say.

At the close of the show, the couple sang
“Up In Smoke” as the audience sang along.
Chong said that all proceeds from the show
would go to hungry, poor children — his. He
said they get the munchies and eat all the food in
his house.
Local comedian Butch Lord opened the
show with a short set also based on marijuana
jokes. Lord told about experiences with friends
who liked to play head games with him when he
was high, such as “Hey man, you ever been so
high you forgot to breathe?”
Lord is the host of a radio program at 10
p.m. Saturdays on 104.1 FM, Extreme Radio.

Bowie outpaced the
Beatles In B ritain
LONDON (AP) — With a knack for reinventing his image and music to
suit the times, David Bowie outpaced the Beatles as the top music star of
the past 30 years in a poll of his British contemporaries. The 51-year-old
rock icon has been the most important act of the last three decades,
according to the survey of pop stars, musicians, critics and industry figures.
The poll was conducted by London listings magazine Time Out to mark
its 30th birthday. Votes were cast by the likes of Culture Club’s Boy George
and Mick Hucknall of Simply Red. The magazine did not say how many

His skills as a collaborator have

Alii Khat is not a licensed therapist1
and her advice should only be taken seriously
if you are very desperate, or make numerous
phone calls to psychic hot lines.

What are your three alltime favorite bands?
“Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam
and Silverchair because
it’s the music I listen to
and I can relate to it.”

Dear Alii Khat,
I’m so pissed about the parking situation on this campus. We
have to walk five miles to the parking lot and when we have
guests they get tickets for parking close to the residence halls.
I’m getting close to knocking some parking service agent’s block
off. Any advice? Pissed Parker

Dear Pissed Parker,
Well, I say go fo r the block knockin’. W hat’s the worst that
could happen, a few nights in jail? That could be a fun
experience and a great way to EXPAND your horizons.
Dear Alii Khat,
Some kids down the hall from us got busted for marijuana. Why can’t they do what
they want when they’re in their own rooms? HIGH Ding Out

,

Dear HIGH Ding Out
“Bad Boys, Metallica
and No Limit because
they sing about the truth
and are good to party
to.”
-Antonio Holland,
Sophomore, Computer
Science

Drugs are bad um ’kay, First o f all we have to remember that marijuana is illegal.
However, there are better places to party where people aren’t so nosy.
Dear Alii Khat,
The other day I was getting something to eat at the UC after an extreme workout. I
put my student ID in my sports bra so I wouldn’t misplace it. When I pulled it out
and handed it to the chick, she acted offended and would barely accept it. Was I
that rude or what? Sweaty Bra Stuffer

Dear Sweaty Bra Stuffer,
You know there are only a selected few who will accept those food line positions.
You weren’t rude; she was. And next time, pull it out o f your underwear.

“Tool, Beastie Boys
and Rage Against the
Machine because they
are interesting to listen
to and they make sense.”

STUDENTS
When a movie star begins exploiting spirituality just to
make a buck, look out!
Such is the case with Eddie Murphy, star of Touchstone
Pictures’ latest flop, “Holy Man.” “Holy Man” is one of the
hokiest, most annoying films that Hollywood has ever had
the audacity to produce. M urphy’s character, G, is a simple
street bum who appears on the side of the interstate in a white
cloak just in time to save the souls and heal the spirits of two
money-hungry home shopping executives who are stuck with
a flat tire.
G is a simple man on a spiritual pilgrimage. He has no
Social Security num ber or driver’s license. He comes in peace.
That is why the lovely Kate Newell (Kelly Preston) offers to
let G stay in her apartment the first time they meet on a
freeway in Miami. After all, he seems like a “nice guy.”
But her co-worker Ricky Hayman (Jeff Goldblum) has
another opinion. He thinks they should get the heck out of
there. After backing up his car and almost running over G, he
soon realizes that G has fainted and needs to be taken to a
hospital.
The rest is so elementary that you could probably figure it
out without even seeing the movie and save yourself so m etime to boot. The “Holy M an” terrorizes the stage of the Good
Buy Shopping Network, the ratings go through the roof and G
is suddenly a celebrity on the cover of every major magazine
in America. H e’s more popular than Jimmy Swaggart and Jim
and Tammy Faye Baker put together.
But who is the mysterious “Holy Man”? In one pathetic
attempt at poignancy, he says “Would you rather be the richest
man in the world or the Dalai Lama?” Unfortunately, G is
neither. H e’s a hokey spiritualist who uses the medium of
home shopping to convey a simple message; this movie sucks,
but you should slow down and “take a good look at the grass.”
The only halfway funny moments in this movie are Jeff
Goldblum’s quick-witted put downs, but after a while his
skittish demeanor begins to wear thin on the audience. If
there’s a bright side to this film, it’s that the cast apparently
had lots of fun making this movie.
The theme of this movie seems to be that commercialism
and spirituality can coexist. Apparently, the only thing more
hollow than G ’s phony spirituality is the imaginary world that
an over-zealous casting director put him into.
