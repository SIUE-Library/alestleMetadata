Cigarette ashes causes $100
fire damage in Woodland Hall
■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
A fire occurred in Woodland
Hall at approximately 4:30 p.m.
Monday. According to Michael
Schultz, housing director, the fire
was caused by cigarette ashes
being dumped in a trash can in a
male resident’s dorm room on the
first floor. The fire department
responded at 4:40 p.m. alerting
officials to have the building

evacuated. A ccording to the
Residence Hall front desk
manager, LaDawn Young, the fire
was discovered by resident
assistant. Jack Gibson.
Gibson, a peer assistant, was
working on hom ework in his
room when he heard the alarm in
the room go off. It turned out to
be his suitemate’s room. Gibson
then got a fire extinguisher and
put the fire out.
Gibson said he smelled
smoke coming from the room.
He knocked on the door but no

one was inside. The door was
unlocked and when he entered,
the room was filled with smoke.
An evacuation o f the entire
building was the end result. The
room was empty at the time
because both roommates were
out of the room, with one in a
meeting on campus.
Residence assistant, Scott
Hopfinger of 2 North Wing in
Woodland Hall, said that this was
the first fire of the semester.

Cougar Village residents suffer
from power outage, may be due
to unseasonal snow, bad weather
■ BY DANIELLE

Students woke up to dead
alarm clocks, no lights and in
some cases no heat this morning
in Cougar Village and found that
the entire housing complex was
without power Monday morning.
The
pow er
w ent
out
approximately 8:30 a.m., leaving
some students w ithout heat.
According to Housing Director
M ichael Schultz, the pow er
outage was a result o f a
statew ide pow er outage in

certain areas o f Illinois. Schultz
said that Illinois Pow er, the
electricity supplier for the state,
cited the problem as w eather
related but the results are still
unofficial.
Though m any apartm ents
still had heat due to gas furnaces,
several apartment buildings in
Cougar
Village
function
completely on electricity leaving
them cold till the electricity
returned. Some students went
without hot water and usage of
their stoves and ovens.
Power was restored to the
apartments at 1:45 p.m.

Due to the high demand of
first-class apartments at Cougar
Village for fall of 1998 and a
favorable construction contract,
current and incoming University
Housing residents now have
more options and a better
opportunity to get the housing
assignment they desire. Also,
more
private
and
deluxe
private bedroom s are being
made available.

When this year’s University
Housing Reservation Process was
designed, it was under the
assumption that the renovations
due to take place at Cougar
Village would occur over four
phases. This design would have
resulted in a number of housing
spaces being unavailable for
students
to
occupy,
as
renovations would begin in May
of 1998 and continue throughout
the sum m er 1998, fall 1998,
spring 1999 and summer 1999
terms. However, when the
renovations went to bid, the

contractor currently working on
Prairie Residence Hall, Fru-Con,
estimated the project to take up
only two terms, summer 1998
and summer 1999. Although this
plan would require changing the
University Housing Reservation
Process, the inconveniences were
m inor
com pared
to
the
advantages created.
“We were running out of
space and this way we now can
accom m odate everyone,” said
Lisa
M cKirgan,

director of University Housing.

Mock student government lights up statehouse for weekend
BOSTON
(AP)
—
Lawm akers w orked into the
weekend on Beacon Hill to
tackle
pressing
business,
including bills to license bounty
hunters, ban cam eras in the
courtroom and raise the age to
buy tobacco products.
But these w eren’t ordinary

legislators. The high school-age
representatives, senators and
administrators were taking part in
the YMCA’s annual mock
government program.
In a three-day event that
began Friday and ends Sunday,
200
students
claim ed
the
Statehouse corridors, attending
training sessions, com m ittee
hearings, and press conferences.
They held a delegates
caucus and roll call, and
conducted
L egislative
and
Supreme Court sessions without
so much as a single adult telling
them what to do.
They even came equipped
with their own press corps.
“I love the stress,” said Ryan
Keith, editor o f The Beacon, a
student paper covering the event,

which has been held in
M assachusetts for the last
15 years.
The students, who came
from
all
corners
o f the
com m onw ealth,
wrote
legislation, defended it in
committee hearings and debated
it on the floors of the House
and Senate.
Many of them looked and
sounded the parts they played,
and some seemed ready to step
right from the classroom into the
House Chamber.
“I enjoy politics, because it
enables m e to interact with
others and develop better
solutions,” said Gov. Michael
Kane of Quincy, a Boston
College High School senior. “It
allows me to have a positive

impact on people.”
The most contentious bills
included an act to legalize
chemical castration for certain
convicted sex offenders, a
proposal Kane opposed on the
grounds that it “can be
considered unusual punishment
under the Constitution.”
“This should be a matter
of choice for the person who
is convicted,” said Kane, elected
at last y ear’s conference and
sworn in by Rep. Thomas
Finneran the real House
Speaker - on Friday.
The
mock
government
sessions started in New York in
1936, and have spread to 42
states. There are 55,000 students
involved this year nationwide,
said
Andy
Sullivan,
the

program’s associate director.
M arcia Dudley, the state
director, said she got involved
after seeing how the program
changed her son’s outlook. “I
could see how he was becoming a
bitter person and then how
compassionate and caring and a
little less com petitive he was
afterward,” said Dudley, whose
son went on to attend the Air
Force Academy and is now a
captain in the Air Force.
Said Audrey Rose, an Oliver
Ames High School senior who is
in her third year as a member of
the governor’s council, “Some
people come because they want
to go into politics, and others are
here to share ideas from around
the state.”

students walked to the University
Center to eat dinner and wait it
out till the residence assistants
announced that it was all right
to return.
Carson was lucky compared
to
some
other
residents.
Freshman Sarah Lawson, a
psychology major, was in a
friend’s room watching “Days of
Our Lives” when the alarm went
off. Carson had no shoes nor coat
and had to borrow them from
friends. She also didn’t have her
keys and was forced to leave her
room unlocked.
“We don’t have our ID’s, or
keys or anything,” Carson said.
Several freshm en thought
the alarm was fake due to
incidents last sem ester with
students lifting their cigarette

lighters to the sprinkler systems
to set them off.
At 5:05 p.m., students were
allowed to return to Woodland
Hall. The only damages were the
male resident’s garbage can and a
small piece o f carpet on the floor.
Schultz estimates that it will be
about $100 worth of damage.
According to Schultz, in the
four years since Woodland Hall
was built there has been
approximately three fires there.
He attributes most of last
semester’s alarm incidents to a
broken sprinkler head.
There was also an incident
involving a fire alarm in
W oodland Hall earlier last
semester but Schultz said there
was no fire at that time.

Our stupid days
and wild nights
You came here to graduate, so
what seems to be the problem?
As
college
students,
stress
com es
with the
territory. The entire
Danielle Alestle staff could
Belton
easily be placed in
the category o f
students who do too much. But
this drive to do as much as we
can, cram between these most
important years, can cause
students to lose focus on the
main goal of every college
student - graduation.
There are always good
intentions at first. “We came to
school to learn," says the little
voice in the back of our minds.
But after a few days for new
freshman, this voice ends up
blowing somewhere in the wind
as they savor their first tastes of
college freedom.
Wild nights o f drunken
abandon and long stupid days of
missing class persist, as students
lose focus and forget what their
main goal was. It doesn’t take
long till they’re on academic
probation and taking more than
the normally four to five years
to graduate.
There is always a price to pay
for having a little too much fun
that first year. It often ends up
taking longer for some students
to graduate. Some students get
pregnant, others drop out, and
some even ruin their lives. But
all hope isn’t lost. It’s simply
important
that
students
remember their main reason for
coming here. If the reason was
to party, students can do that at
home. It is important to have a
social
life,
but
students
shouldn’t treat it as if it was
their whole purpose in being
here.
No time passes as long as you
think it does. Time goes fast. An
education is not something a
student should waste for the
sake of a good time all the time.

Commentary -------------------------------------------- -------------------

Things won’t change until students
become involved in the university
Student
Government
recently sponsored a program
entitled “Speak Out to the
Student Government” to address
issues that concern the students.
This was a very successful
program, but it was successful for
the
simple
fact
that
administrators cared enough to
represent their office to address
particular issues. I am very
pleased that we had enough
students show up and voice their
opinions. These students are the
individuals
that
make
a
difference on this campus.
However, this campus has many
complainers and not enough

“doers.” Many students have
several problems and complaints,
but they do not take the time to
do anything about it. Student
Government’s purpose is to be
the voice for the students.
Unfortunately, many students do
not use this opportunity to their
advantage. I have participated in
Student Government for the past
year and I have been really
disappointed with the students’
input.
Each
Senator
and
Executive Officer have to fulfill
office hours each week. These
office hours are supposed to be
used to com m unicate with
students, but the fact is that

students do not come to the office
and voice their opinions. I would
have to ask, Do students really
care? Changes and decisions are
being made that effect the student
body and students do not even
take the time to come and voice
their opinion to “their” student
government. This is a problem.
Many people complain about the
decisions that have been made by
the University,; but where were
you when the decision making
process was going on. This
campus has a hard time getting
people involved and this is a
shame. I think that it is time for
students to take a little more

initiative to make a difference on
campus. If your logic is “what
ever I say will not change
anything,” I would have to say
that is the easy way out. Students,
wake up and use the advantages
that are given to you. Come by
the Student Government Office
or call extension #3818 and voice
your opinion. O nce again, I
would like to thank the students
and
representatives
that
participated in the “Speak to
Student Government” program.

too high. The article also stated
that other colleges have suffered
financially due to football.
After the initial costs of
getting a program started, the
rewards would do nothing but
benefit
the
school.
Take
McKendree College for example,
a small NAIA division one school
in Lebanon, 111 which recently
started a program. The games at
McKendree have been sold out
since the opening season in 1996.
The profits earned from one day
of concessions alone are enough
to finance a season. The school
would also benefit from the
enrollm ent increase due to
entering football players. Not
only
would
the
players
themselves be interested in this
school but friends of the players
and fans of football would also be
drawn tc the campus.
Other than
the added
enrollment and the financial
benefits the school would also
benefit from the pride instilled by
a football team. From the

reaction of students to the article
in the Alestle, the fan base of
football would be much larger
than some of the sports which are
in the spotlight at SIUE.
As the son o f a coach who
helped start a football program at
a small private college in central
Illinois, I’ll be the first to say that
it is not an easy task. I, however,
do not think that attacking the
idea of having a program with
talks of finances and low fan base
is proper justification for the
absence of football here at SIUE.
In my opinion, and what seems
like many others as well, a
football program would not only
enhance the lack of school spirit
on the cam pus, but would
com plete the file o f already
successful program s here at
SIUE.

Three planned to bomb buildings, kill federal judge
EAST ST. LOUIS, 111. (AP) —
A man who left the Ku Klux Klan
because it wasn’t radical enough,
a retired Illinois prison guard and
a construction worker plotted to
bomb buildings across the
country and kill a federal judge,
prosecutors said.
Federal authorities said the
men are mem bers o f a white
suprem acist group called The
New Order. They were arrested
Feb. 23 in raids at their southern
Illinois homes, where authorities
found guns, a pipe bomb and
hand grenades.
FBI agent Jason Thompson
said at the m en’s bail hearing

Friday that they had formed a “hit
list” that included lawyer Morris
Dees, who heads the Southern
Poverty Law C enter and an
unidentified federal judge.
They also planned to bomb the
Southern Poverty Law Center’s
office in Montgomery, Ala., the
Anti-Defamation League’s New
York headquarters and the Simon
W iesenthal C enter in Los
Angeles, Thompson testified.
He said the group planned to
rob banks and armored cars to
finance the plot, as well as
contam inate “a large w ater
supply” w ith cyanide as a
diversionary tactic while they

carried
out
the
bombing
in Alabama.
Rabbi A braham
Cooper,
associate dean o f the Simon
W iesenthal
Center,
which
regularly monitors the activities
of some 250 extremist groups,
said it w asn’t unusual for
his group to get hate mail
and threats.
Douglas Forsythe, an attorney
for one suspect, said the
government “was relying on a
bunch of big talk ” and a
confidential
inform ant. The
lawyer said the men had
committed no crime.
“T hey’ve
got
taped

conversation, but they’ve got no
actions,” Forsythe said.
The three were identified as
form er KKK regional leader
Dennis Michael McGiffen, 35;
retired Illinois D epartm ent of
Corrections guard Wallace Scott
Weicherding, 64; and Ralph P.
Bock, 27, a construction worker.
Each is charged with one
count of conspiracy to possess
and make m achine guns and
destructive devices, which carries
a maximum penalty of five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman
Smith said other charges would
be filed.
U.S.
M agistrate
Judge
Clifford J. Proud ordered them
held without bond and set a trial
date of April 27.

A fourth man, Glenn Levelle
Lowtharp, also is named in the
indictment. Prosecutors said
Lowtharp is in federal custody,
but they would not say why he
was not in court Friday.
Prosecutors said Friday that
McGiffen was the leader of the
group and recruited Weicherding
and Bock. After McGiffen left
the KKK because it w asn’t
radical enough, he began forming
The New O rder last May,
Thompson said. The group was
modeled after a similar group,
The Order, led by Robert
Matthews in Washington state.

Albright issues stern
warnings to Serbia, Iraq
ROME
(AP)
—
U.S.
Secretary of State M adeleine
Albright, looking ahead to a
key international meeting on
the Kosovo crisis, said Saturday
that “decisive and firm action”
against Serbia is needed to
end
the
violence
against
ethnic
A lbanians
in
the
Yugoslavian province.
“We are not going to stand by
and watch the Serbian authorities
do in Kosovo what they can no
longer get away with doing in

Bosnia,” Albright said during a
joint news conference with
Italian
Foreign
M inister
Lamberto Dini.
Albright, who is on the second
leg of a seven-nation foreign tour,
also had w hat she called a
“fabulous” m eeting with Pope
John Paul II in which they
discussed Cuba and other issues.

OPENS MARCH G™ EVERYWHERE

CHICAGO
(AP)
Ameritech Corp. has quietly
instituted a price increase that
would raise the cost of making
many local toll calls
The increase affects all Illinois
customers who keep their current
basic calling plan. Those who
change calling plans could see an
even greater increase.
The
consum er-advocacy
group Citizens Utility Board is
criticizing the move, and its
executive director, Martin Cohen,
says the group will probably try
to block the rate hike.
The increases are tucked away
in an A m eritech calling plan
dubbed Simpli-Five. Customers
could pay a nickel for each local
call and a nickel a minute for
calls eight to 15 miles away. In
the past, calls eight to 15 miles
away cost about four cents for the
first minute and less than two
cents for each additional minute.
Ameritech custom ers could
avoid the higher rate by keeping
their current calling plans. Those
not signing up for the SimpliFive plan will be charged seven
cents a minute for calls to
places 15 miles away or farther.
That is up from five cents a

minute
under
A m eritech’s
previoeis rate structure.
“No one plan fits every
custom er,”
said
Ameritech
spokesman Bill Pendergast. “It
depends on your calling pattern.
Someone who doesn’t make
many calls but whose calls last a
long time might benefit more
from one of our CallPak plans
that charge a flat rate per call.”
Ameritech can change its local
toll rates w ithout regulatory
approval because local phone
service has been subject to
competition for two years.
“W hen
this
so-called
competition started nearly two
years ago, Ameritech made a flat
rate of four cents a m inute,”
Cohen said. “After a while they
raised it to five cents and now it’s
seven cents. So in two years of
what they call competition, the
rate has effectively doubled.”
A m eritech custom ers can
avoid the rate hike by taking their
local toll business to other
com panies. AT&T and Sprint
offer flat rates of five cents a
minute and M CI’s peak rate is
five cents a minute with an offpeak rate of four cents a minute.

international
resolve
could
embolden Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to step up his
campaign to tame the Kosovo
independence movement led by
ethnic Albanians.
O f the six nations that will
assemble Monday in London to
discuss the Kosovo situation,
Russia is regarded as the
strongest opponent of tough
action against M ilosevic. Italy
also is seen as reluctant.
An adm inistration official
accompanying Albright said her
first goal in London will be to
convince
the
six,
known
informally as the contact group,
of the need for a firm response
and then to seek diplomatic and
economic penalties against the
Serbs. In addition to the United
States, Russia and Italy, the other
members of the contact group
are France, Britain and Germany.
Albright believes a discussion
of military action is premature at
this point and did not discuss that
option in her meeting with Dini.
Dini denounced the Serb actions
in Kosovo as “brutal and violent”
but
stopped
short
of
recommending punitive measures.
As of Friday, an estim ated
45 ethnic A lbanians and six
Serb police had died in the
recent unrest.
Russia sees the violence as
largely an internal matter and, in
an apparent signal of opposition
to a stiff response, will send a

deputy foreign m inister to'
London instead o f Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
The violence in Kosovo has
triggered fears that neighboring
countries, including Albania,
Greece and Macedonia, could be
drawn into the conflict.
It
also
has
dampened
considerably the upbeat mood
prevailing in W ashington less
than two weeks ago about its
overall policy towards the former
Yugoslavia.
After Milosevic signaled his
support for the new, moderate
prime minister of the Serb entity
in Bosnia, Milorad Dodik, the
Clinton administration decided to
ease sanctions against Belgrade.
These
included
giving
Belgrade permission to open a
consulate in the United States, to
give its national airline U.S.
landing rights and to expand its
U.N. mission.
Following the upsurge in
violence
in
Kosovo,
the
administration withdrew these
concessions. Albright told the
news conference that action
was taken to ensure that Serbia
“pays the price” for its conduct
in Kosovo.
Italy, while seeking a more
cautious approach on Kosovo
than does the United States,
also is at odds with Washington
on Iran.
After the European Union
ended a ban on high-level visits

to Iran late last month, Dini
showed up in Tehran a few days
later. Dini insisted on Saturday
that Iran m ust follow up
its
moderate
words
with
concrete deeds.
Albright, in an apparent dig at
Dini’s foray to Tehran, said, “In
our effort to encourage change
(in Iran), declaring success
prematurely is the surest way to
delay success indefinitely.”
She added that there were
differences between the United
States and the EU on “pacing and
tactics” concerning Iran.
Albright and Dini also
discussed the situation in Iraq and
agreed that Baghdad must give
free access to U.N. weapons
inspectors, consistent with U.N.
Security Council resolutions.
“No one is going to give peace
an
unlim ited
num ber
of
chances,” Albright said.
According to a U.S. official,
Albright told the pope his recent
visit to Cuba could be a “point of
departure" on the island for
political change.
State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said Albright
stressed to the pope “America’s
desire to find ways to help the
Cuban
people
without
strengthening their repressive
government.”
Albright gave the pope a
leather-bound book about the
first Polish immigrants in the
United States.

A zealous fiscal
watchdog battles way
toward Capital Hill
CHICAGO (AP) — From the
glass and steel tow ers of
corporate America to the drafty
halls and evangelical churches of
the anti-abortion movement,
Peter Fitzgerald delivers a
simple message.
“I am the only conservative
candidate, fiscal or otherwise, in
this contest,” declares the 37year-old
m illionaire
state
senator.
And if the sm ooth, selfassured suburban bank lawyer
wins the March 17 Republican
primary and goes on to beat
Democratic U.S. Sen. Carol
M oseley-Braun next fall he
may well prove to be the
most
conservative
Illinois
senator in decades.
Over six years in the Illinois
Senate, the studious, Dartmoutheducated Fitzgerald has emerged
as a zealous fiscal watchdog,
ripping into tax proposals
and anything he views as
squandering like a grand
inquisitor rooting out sin.
He opposes abortion except
to save the m other’s life and has
voted to allow trained private
citizens to carry concealed
weapons. In addition, he
spearheaded legislation to bar
Illinois from recognizing gay
marriages performed elsewhere.

Skeptics warn that his
staunch conservative views may
go too far for swing voters and
merely make an easy target for
the Democrats come November.
Gov. Jim Edgar and a host of
GOP luminaries back moderate
state
com ptroller
Loleta
Didrickson as the best bet to
capitalize on M oseley-Braun’s
political woes.
Fitzgerald brushes aside all
such qualms. He says there’s
“not a dim e’s worth of
difference” betw een “Liberal
Loleta” and Moseley-Braun on
fiscal issues.
Didrickson is far from a
liberal. She supports the death
penalty while opposing partial
birth abortion and proposals for
a national health care program,
which she calls “socialized
health care.”
Fitzgerald insists the real
reason why party leaders oppose
him is concern that as a political
“outsider” he would shake things
up too much.
"The image of these party
leaders sitting around smoking
cigars, drinking bourbon and
looking for a (rival) candidate
tells me that I must be doing
som ething right,” he told
reporters last summer.

Attorneys reach $4 million settlement over gas explosion
OVERLAND PARK. Kan.
(AP) — Four companies have
agreed to pay $4 m illion to
the victims of a 1996 natural
gas explosion in this Kansas
City suburb, attorneys for the
victims said.
The Oct. 3, 1996, explosion
happened after workers severed

an underground pipe that had
been mismarked and then failed
to call emergency personnel or
the gas com pany before the
escaping gas ignited.
Two women were seriously
injured in the blast, which
dem olished their home and
heavily damaged several others

near the explosion site.
A lawsuit was filed in Johnson
County D istrict Court against
Central Locating Service, K&W
Underground, United Cities Gas
Co. and TCI o f Overland Park.
An attorney with a law firm
that represented the family of the
women said all four companies

were involved in the settlement
but did not say how much each
would pay.
"This case shows just how at
risk we all are to the land mines
in our back yards when the
people who are supposed to
maintain them safely do not do
their jobs,” Thomas said.

Both women have undergone
physical therapy to learn how to
walk again, and both will require
lifelong
medical
treatment,
officials said.
Lawyers for two of the
com panies
confirm ed
the
settlement but said some details
had not been worked out.

Do clean bathrooms equal safer schools?
ATLANTA (AP) — School
bathrooms are a good place for

furtive smoking and bullying
classmates. Not to mention

down in Center Court!

Enjoy the music from 10:30am to 1:30pm

Tuesday, March 10th
«.V4rfrtM S u m ...

Center Court is located on the lower level o f the University Center

graffiti, broken m irrors and
purposely clogged toilets.
An inner-city school is
attacking the filth and stench in
hopes that a fresh paint job and
more paper towels can help fight
violence, gangs and drug use.
Tom Keating, a former teacher
and school board m em ber in
suburban Atlanta, won a $3,500
grant from the U.S. Department
of Justice for his project to do
what the janitors apparently
could not: clean up bathrooms at
Cross Keys High School and
other schools.
School psychologists believe
that creating a spotless, cheery
school is one step toward
stopping
violence,
making
schools more comfortable and
helping students learn. And
restroom s, which have less
supervision than the rest of the
building, are typically one of the
dirtiest and most dangerous parts
of a school.
Bathrooms are widely known
as sites for smoking, threats and
vandalism. Many students refuse
to use school restrooms, instead
waiting until they get home.
“They’re the soft underbelly
of the school building. I think as
the restroom goes, so goes the
school,” Keating said.
Student groups have adopted
each of the bathrooms at Cross
Keys and are attacking dreary

walls, garbage on the floor,
unflushed toilets and the neverending deluge of gang graffiti
that proved too much for
custodians in the 40-year-old
rambling building.
“We were dealing with it
strictly in a reactive mode:
Whatever they do, w e’ll clean it
up,” school principal Tim
Freeman said.
The DeKalb County School
District paid $300 for paint, and
the walls in two bathrooms are
now decorated with bright,
student-painted murals.
“What you see on the walls
makes you feel like you’re in a
good school,” said 19-year-old
Juan Olivares, a senior.
Psychologists say the more
pleasant the surroundings, the
more likely children are to feel
safe and respected at school.
“They feel that somebody
cares about them when someone
provides toilet paper in the
bathroom,
when
somebody
makes sure there are paper towels
in the paper towel dispenser,”
said Kevin Dwyer, assistant
executive director of the National
Association
of
School
Psychologists.
That, in turn, makes children
more likely to learn and less
likely to be violent.
Dwyer gives the example of a
crackdown on jaywalking, public

urinating and drunkenness in
New York. With the “quality of
life policing,” violent crime went
down, he said.
Keating is using his grant to
pay him self for working with
students and faculty at Cross
Keys and other schools in metro
Atlanta to find out their ideas
about how to clean up bathrooms.
He started with Cross Keys —
a crowded school of 1,300 which
sprawls in so many directions
that administrators need walkietalkies to communicate with each
other — because it was on his bus
line and the principal was
cooperative. Sixty-seven percent
of Cross Keys’ students are so
poor that they qualify to receive
free and subsidized lunches.
Keating has also worked with
Lithonia and Tucker high
schools, both in metro Atlanta,
and has applied for another
federal grant.
The Department of Justice’s
law enforcem ent block grants
are
distributed
by
local
governm ents
for
several
purposes, including increasing
security around schools.

departm ent,

WATCHDOG------from page 5

On close inspection, though,
Fitzgerald doesn’t look much like
an outsider.
The tw o-term state senator
grew up as one of three sons of
Gerald F. Fitzgerald — an operaloving, big-game hunting wine
connoisseur who created a
banking empire and sat on Gov.
Richard B. O gilvie’s Illinois
Racing Board.
Money and politics went hand
in hand in the Fitzgeralds’
com fortable brick hom e in
Inverness.
W hen
Gerald
Fitzgerald finally sold his
Suburban Bancorp to Chicago’s
H arris Bank — a Bank of
M ontreal subsidiary — his
offspring were well taken care of.
Son P eter’s net worth is
estim ated at upwards of $50
million. His financial disclosure
reports list up to $40 million in
Bank of Montreal shares alone.
He has borrowed against that
fortune to finance his campaign.
By the time Peter Fitzgerald
graduated from Catholic schools
and headed off to Dartmouth,
politics already was in his blood.

While still an undergraduate he
got his first political break as an
intern to U.S. Rep. Philip M.
Crane,
R -Ill.,
one
of
W ashington’s
best
known
conservatives.
Assured in his skills at sizing
up the political landscape,
sophomore Fitzgerald also wrote
a 1980 essay for the Dartmouth
paper that told readers Ronald
Reagan “carries heavy political
baggage.”
“At 69 years of age, Reagan
has difficulty convincing voters
that he is the right man for the
1980s,” he wrote. “So too, as a
staunch conservative, Reagan
has difficulty convincing his
fellow Republicans that he has
the ability to capture the
moderate vote.”
Didrickson’s campaign staff
now eagerly hands out copies.
After getting a degree from
the University of Michigan law
school, Fitzgerald worked as an
attorney n the family banking
business.
In 1992, he arrived at the
Statehouse as one of five newly

elected conservative senators,
representing a district in the
northwest
suburbs
around
Inverness
where
he
lives
with wife, Nina, and 5-year-old
son, Jake.
The
five
newcomers
confidently vowed to end
decades of budget squandering
and
shell-game
accounting
practices that concealed state
debt from the voters.
Senate
veterans
smiled
tolerantly and dubbed them the
“Fab Five.” And when GOP
leaders frowned on some of the
revolutionary
changes,
the
freshmen didn’t press the issue.
“They
w ere
presenting
themselves
as
hard-nosed
conservatives but I think that
hard nose got blunted a bit by
Senate politics and perhaps by
electoral politics as well,” says
Jim Nowlan, a former lawmaker
and
authority
on
Illinois
government.
All the same, as one of
Springfield’s m ost disciplined
homework doers, Fitzgerald has
little tolerance for those who try

to fudge their way through.
“I
don’t
think
there’s
an arrogance in Peter at all,”
said
state
Sen.
Steve
Rauschenberger,
R-Elgin,
another Fab Five stalwart.
“But he does sometimes speak
in shorthand ... he’s not quite
circumspect enough and he can
be im patient with people he
thinks haven’t thought through an
issue,” Rauschenberger adds.
Fitzgerald’s
self-assurance
was underlined in the 1994
election just two years after his
Statehouse debut — when
he
challenged
his
old
conservative
mentor,
Phil
Crane,
in
a
Republican
congressional primary.
Some outraged conservatives
said Fitzgerald should back off,
but others said that after decades
on Capitol Hill, Crane should
make way for fresh blood.
Fitzgerald lost. Later, he
buried the hatchet with Crane.
But he made it plain that
Capitol Hill was still his dream.
And he’s devoted him self to it
ever since, carefully building a

following among the anonymous,
anti-abortion foot soldiers who
work the precincts and the
churches, ringing doorbells and
passing out leaflets.
H e’s
complementing that strategy by
blanketing the airw aves with
sophisticated ads promising to
declare war on taxes.
“H e’s very corporate, very
white shoe, but he speaks the
language
of
movement
conservatives
as
w ell,”
conservative organizer Tom
Roeser said.
Fitzgerald saves the tip of his
blowtorch for the hated tax
collector. At times his rhetoric
takes on a ring o f almost
messianic zeal.
W hen education groups were
showering praise on plans to
increase state aid to schools by
raising the Illinois income tax,
Fitzgerald was sounding as if he
were somehow in a wrestling
match with Satan, himself.
“I will fight it,” he declared,
“with every ounce of strength in
my body.”

Computer report shows black felons receive longer sentences
RICHM OND, Va. (AP) —
Black felons get slapped with
more prison tim e than white
felons in Richmond courts, and
the disparity between sentences
for blacks and w hites is
particularly wide in the city’s
South Side, the Richmond TimesDispatch reported Sunday.
In
the
South
S ide’s
M anchester court, where veteran
Judge Jam es B. W ilkinson
presides, blacks convicted of
violent felonies such as murder,
rape or aggravated assault
received an average of more than

7.5 years in prison. W hites
convicted of violent felonies got
an average of about 3.5 years. In
the city’s N orth Side cases,
judges handed down nearly six
years to black violent felons
and just over 4.5 years to whites
on average.
The same trend held in
felonies other than violent
crimes. In those less cases, blacks
convicted on the South Side got
nearly a year and a half on
average, while whites received
less than a year.
The Times-Dispatch analyzed

P O P T h e M o s t B e a u t i f u l B l ond<

more than 10,000 Richmond
Circuit Court convictions from
June 30, 1994 to Sept. 30, 1997
to develop its findings. Jacob Van
Bowen Jr., a professor of
mathematics at the University of
Richmond, also perform ed an
independent statistical analysis of
the data. He concluded the racial
disparity in sentencing is almost
twice as large on the South Side
as the North Side.
“There is no question about
the weight of the data,” Bowen
said. “That difference is a big,
big difference.”
The analysis does not offer
conclusive proof that race affects
sentencing in Richmond courts,
because various factors — the
differing seriousness of crimes
within the category “violent

felonies,” for example — can
affect the length of a sentence.
But analysts checked as many
factors as possible, including
breaking the numbers down
by individual crime type and
taking into account defendants’
prior criminal records. None of
those factors helped explain the
racial disparity.
“We
have
looked
at
everything we have in the data
that could explain it,” Bowen
said. "This is a statistical finding,
not a fluke.”
Bowen, however, said just
because
an
alternative
explanation has not yet been
found does not mean one can
definitively conclude that there is
racial
bias
in
Richmond
sentencing.

“More data would make the
picture clearer,” he said.
W ilkinson, the sole South
Side circuit judge, disputed
the findings.
“The computer doesn’t tell the
whole story, and in using that,
you are telling a falsehood,” he
said. “I’ve never looked at the
color of a person’s skin in
sentencing.”
W ilkinson is not solely
responsible for the sentences. In a
jury trial, jurors recommend a
sentence and the judge may
impose or reduce it.
No data was available to
determine whether South Side
juries
recom m end
longer
sentences than North Side juries,
or w hether W ilkinson just
reduces his ju rie s’ sentence
recommendations less than other
Richmond judges do.
Wilkinson, who turns 72 this

cleaning up school bathrooms
will make them less likely sites of
petty crimes and intimidation.
“I guess the idea is the kids are
going to feel safer,” she said.
Experts in school behavior say
restroom s are a good starting
place, but freshly mopped floors
don’t mean much if schools are
filled with other problems.
“If they ju st stop at the
bathroom s, th at’s missing the
point,” said M ike Furlong, a
school psychologist and professor
at the University of California at
Santa Barbara.
Furlong said that energy
should be applied to other areas,
such as violence and education.
Dwyer agreed that tackling
restrooms is only one step.
“It’s sort of like the building is
burning down but everybody has
a little mist sprayer of water to
keep things going,” he said.
But Freeman said his school
is not focusing on bathrooms
to the detrim ent of other
school programs.
“I t’s not like, today w e’re
going to paint bathrooms instead
of read. Or, no math today, let’s
paint,” the principal said. “I don’t
think the restrooms are going to
raise SAT scores 50 points.”

Why does it always cost me
money to learn a lesson? I made
the mistake of agreeing to
accompany friends to one of the
casino boats this weekend. It
took almost a full year since my
spring break trip to Vegas for the
gambling bug to come and nip
me in the buttocks again.
Somehow I keep forgetting
how much I despise casinos,
whether they’re on land or water.
Somehow, I keep picturing Las
Vegas from the '40s, with
showgirls, martinis, flashing
lights and rat-packers at every
twist and turn. Oh, how my
creative brain lies to me. Anyone
who knows if this Shangri-La
type vision exists, please
drop me a line. Because I keep
stumbling onto something
quite different.
First of all, I would like to
know where these casino-people
come from. Where were they
before the casinos opened — in
the sewers packing together like
hideous rats? The sight of these
people is enough to send small
children running to the safe arms
of their parents. They are truly
nightmares, each one worse than
the rest. I don’t want to know
80-year-old women who feel the
need to plunk quarters into
machines at 3 a.m. It’s sick.
I can just picture a pack of
them escaping from the
nursing home.
“Mildred just sprung the lock.
Grab your lucky troll dolls and
let's roll Betty!” They amble to
the bus stop in walkers and in
wheelchairs to get to the sweet,
sweet lights and sounds of the
casino boat.

A l e s t l e

At the beginning of the latest
Coen Brothers film, “The Big
Lebowski,” the narrator says of
the main character (The Dude)
that he is “just the right man for
his time.” The same can be said
of this movie: it is exactly what
an industry bogged down by film
noir slacksters and who-done-it
copycats needed. And the Coens

deliver, hilariously.
As usual with the
makers of such films
as “Raising Arizona”
and “Fargo,” the
characters are simple
and the plot is
intricate.

Dude (played by Jeff
Bridges o f "The
Fisher King”), is an

War: simple. But these two get
mixed up in a kidnappinge x to rtio n -th e ft-em b ez z le m e n t
story with more laughs than
anything starring Adam Sandler.
And they keep on bowling all
through it.
Not only do we get to see two
idiots get in way over their heads
and take a good deal of
punishment for it, but we are
constantly reminded that it all
began with a case of mistaken
identity. Some hired goons

The space is jam-packed with sweaty
cats of all shapes and sizes; the swing
kids in their three-piece suits, the hard­
core ska folks with their shaved-heads
and grizzly demeanor and the average
joe, all brimming with excitement.
The closet-size room’s temperature is
that of a mouth after eating a large
Mexican meal. Just walking into the
place provides a stinky sweat bath. But,
the crowd is jazzed all the same.
Onto the tiny Hi-Pointe theater stage
walk the Hepcats. Like a cool breeze,
they settle the room. The crowd starts to
sway like tall grass to the smooth
rhythms of the band. After a lengthy
musical intro, Alex Desert, one of
Hepcats’ two lead singers, starts his wail.
Three hours earlier, Desert was
relaxing and enjoying a pre-show drink.
He met me at the Hi Pointe’s restaurant to
unload the skinny about his dual career as
lead singer for the Hepcats and as a
.Hollywood actor. After roles in “The
Flash,” and “P.C.U.,” Desert snared the
role of Charles in the “money” flick
“Swingers,” which made him part of the
reborn rat pack.
Why do you think Swingers was so
much the phenomenon that it was?
It’s just telling truths. I don’t know

Dude) for the big Lebowski (a
millionaire with the same name),
beat the tar out of him and pee on
his rug. The replacement of this
rug is The
D ude’s only
motivation for most of the movie.
The cinematography is much
more subdued than in their other
films except for two outlandish
dream sequences. Rooting the
audience in reality helps keep this
slapstick comedy believable yet
surprising.
see LEBO W SKI, page 11

how many women came up to me saying
“I’m glad I saw that movie, because now
I know all you guys’ secrets.” And the
odd thing was when we shot the movie, I
never thought of it like that. I just thought
it was a manly m an’s flick. And it’s all
truths. The guy calling the girl after he
just met her. All that is true. We’ve all
done it. And plus also, “Swingers” has
that whole rat pack thing. And the rat
pack symbolizes brotherhood for me
personally. And that’s why there’s such a
huge resurgence of it. I think that’s what
“Swingers” conveyed. And I think w e’re
ready for that in this lifetime.
How do you juggle your music
career with your acting career?
I have no idea. It was easier before,
because the band was pretty much
weekend gigs. I could handle that. Now
that w e’re starting to tour so much, it’s
becoming a pain in my ass. As it is now,
I’ve taken four months off of acting and
there are a lot of jobs I’m missing out on.
But, I’m young. W hen’s the next time
I’m going to be offered the chance to go
around the world to sing for people. I’m
sure the acting will always be there,
because I’ll always have the love for it.
That is my first love, since I was six
years old.

DESERT
from page 9

How long did it take to make
the band smooth?
We’re still trying to make it
smooth. I’d say initially the
band’s music started jelling into
the direction we wanted it to head
about three or four years after we
were playing together. And it
keeps evolving. I don’t know
what the next step will be, but
1 know w e’re m oving in the
right direction.
So
what
m akes
your
group distinct?
I couldn't really answer. I've
heard what other people say.
Every person I know that’s in a
band loves what they do. I’d say
that’s what makes us distinct. But
that doesn’t make sense. I think
perhaps one of the things that
makes us distinct is the blend of
each of our personalities. That
probably is what helps our
music. Does that sound like
bullshit to you?
Did
you
have
a
lot
of personality conflicts to
overcome.
We’re still overcoming them
man. This band never stops. You
have one guy that’s really blase.
One guy that’s really passionate.
Another guy that’s passionate
about being blase.
How do you keep the live
shows fresh after eight years?
We just try to outdo each
other. Like Greg and I, if I throw
something different out into the
vocal mix, maybe he’ll catch
what I did and start running with

T h e

it and it’ll turn into something
else. The same as when w e’re
dancing onstage. We never know
what the hell we’re doing. We
just make it up as we go along,
and that’s what makes it
interesting, exciting. Listening to
the solos every night. They’re
always different and it cracks
me up.
How does love fit into
the music?
That’s one of the reasons we
started the band, so we could
have couples dancing together.
Cause we’d go to ska shows and
a guy and his girlfriend were
dancing
together, but
not
together. We decided we wanted
to make music with couples
looking at each other, dancing
and swinging. That’s a heavy part
of it. Everyone in this band is a
cynical romantic. Talking from
myself, I believe in romance, but
1 think it’s bull. I’ll admit it. I go
home, 1 love listening to Burt
Bacharach and Dionne Warwick.
How do you relax after
a show?
It takes me about fifteen
minutes to wind down from being
up there. Then I enjoy having a
Meyers and Coke (holding up a
near-empty drink). I like enjoying
them before the show as well. It’s
weird you get into a zone when
you’re
done
playing.
Me
personally, my mind’s just racing,
and depending on how connected
I am to the actual performance
that night; if I’m 120 percent on,
I won’t be able to talk to anyone
for about a half-hour. I’ll just sit
with thoughts racing through my
mind. I’ll just have to sit in a
comer and dry myself off.

Y o u r

F u t u r e

A l e s t l e

What kind of preparations
are you making for success?
I don’t think I am. Just rolling
with it, taking it one day at
a time.
What would you say is the
worst part of touring?
Obviously, things waiting for
you at home. The weird thing
about touring, it gets harder the
closer you get to home. You can
see the light at the end of the
tunnel. It’s easier than the start of
the tour. We’re on the road for
another week and a half. All of a
sudden, L.A. is starting to
become a clear picture for me
again. I'm remembering what my
house looks like, remembering I
have to pay bills.
How does the suit make
the man?
The suit makes the man hot if
he’s onstage dancing for an hour
and a half.
Where do you think your
humor spawns from?
I don’t know. My mom was a
funny looking woman. No, no
don’t print that. I’m joking, I’m
joking. I was real chubby as a
kid, so that was part of my selfdefense. I’m still chubby now,
what am I talking about? Now it’s
become real acidic.
How tough is it for young
actors in L.A.?
A lot of traps you can fall into.
Sh*t, I’ve fallen into some of
those traps. There’s a lot of “yes”
men in Los Angeles. W hen you
do fall it hurts, really bad. That’s
one thing you’ve got to
remember; to keep yourself
humble. Pick yourself up. Damn,
I’m proud of myself, but I know
the sh*t won’t be here forever.

GAMBLING-----------------------------------from page 9

These people look so damaged. I’ve seen circus freaks that would
shake their heads in disgust. I tried to look around to find the trashiest
person, but soon had to give up. There was a twenty-way tie! These
people had wrinkles on top of wrinkles! Their teeth were green, their
eyes beady. The hair so unkempt. Buckwheat would say, “Damn, you
need a comb?” How am I supposed to have fun in a place like this?
Oh, but it will all be worth it when you start winning money. Ha!
What rube still believes this? I love hearing about the people who
claim to be winners. Look, there’s a picture o f Joe Schmoe, who won
$5,500 on black jack. Of course, they don’t mention the $36,000 he
spent over the last two months, or about his third mortgage because
he’s sick with the casinos.
I just go in planning on leaving $20 broker. Maybe it’s just the
masochist in me that makes me go. At least in Vegas I can see a decent
show. The next time I get that crazy gambling look in my eye, do me
a favor and slap me.

LEBOWSKI
from page 9

What the Coens do that makes
this movie so important right at
this time is the fun they poke at
Tarantino, the Tarantino rip-offs,
and the whole “Usual Suspects”
genre. Where these movies are
completely serious crime dramas
with brilliant protagonists and a
myriad of supporting roles,
involving only a bit of dry
sadistic wit strategically placed
for shock value, “The Big
Lebowski” is the same thing a la
the Three Stooges. Imagine Jim
Carrey stumbling through “L.A.
Confidential,” or Pauly Shore

squaring off against DeNiro in
“Heat,” or Woody Harrelson in
any serious role. Goodman and
Bridges have that same kind
of goofy effect on such an
intricate story line, only they do
it very well. Not since Pacino
in “Dog Day A fternoon” has
incompetence been played so
competently.
The real treat of "The Big
Lebowski” is wondering how
these morons are going to get
through it, and the end is
anything but predictable (except
for the bowling). So instead of
seeing “Titanic” for the thirtieth
time this weekend, see something
that will keep you guessing and
laughing up to the last frame.

Women’s hoops lose to Mich. Tech; three seniors
■ BY JASON
TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
Women’s hoops traveled to
Evansville, Ind. for the first
round of the NCAA Division II
tourney. Well, at least the Cougar
defense showed up.
With no offensive production,
the SIUE squad had trouble
getting ahead in the 60-47
loss to Michigan Technological
University which ended the
Cougars season and three college

playing careers this weekend.
Shooting for the Cougars
flatlined at just 37 percent. Out of
a mammoth 45 shots taken, SIUE
hit 17 and com m itted 23
turnovers. Bench scoring, and a
standout performance that had
marked Cougar play toward the
end of the season, was absent. In
nine of the last ten games, SIUE
had one, and sometimes two,
twenty-plus point performances.
Cougar senior Alicia Harkins had
the hot hand throughout the
GLVC tourney. She averaged 22
points in the tourney, but could

only manufacture 10 points and
seven rebounds in her last game
as a Cougar.
“They did a good job with
A licia,” Cougar head coach
Wendy Hedberg said. “They
focused on a few of our key
players and made sure they
weren’t a factor.”
Freshman Misi Clark and
junior Kim Lowe came to play
combining for half of SIU E’s
points and Lowe got more
offensive rebounds than the rest
of the team put together.
On the defensive end a totally

different game was played. SIUE
held Michigan Tech under their
scoring average and allowed only
one Husky to set the pace.
Forward Bailey Allison displayed
the definition of individual effort
scoring 21 points with five
rebounds off the bench.
“We
played
excellent
defense,” Hedberg said. “They
have a few stars on the team and
they were not key in the win.”
The loss for the Cougars
enforces the fact that defense
alone cannot win championships.

Cougar softball defeated at
Just goofin’ off
Classic; looking for win in south
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
A five-game losing streak in
the Cougar Classic leaves the
SIUE softball team looking to
pick lip the pieces as they travel
south this weekend.
After a decent showing at the
Southern Classic to open the
season, the Cougars went into a
tailspin last weekend. SIUE
dropped five in a row before
salvaging a win in their last game
of the round-robin tournament.
Peoria’s Sarah Sollberger had
a double, a RBI and a run scored
in a 10-3 loss to the University of
North Alabama in the first game
on Friday. Senior Gwen Jackson
added three hits and scored a run.
Deanna Smith held the
University of Southern Indiana to
only two runs on five hits, but the
Cougars couldn't manage to cross
the plate against conference rival
Southern Indiana in a 2-0 loss.
SIUE and South Dakota State
University played scoreless ball
until the fourth inning when
SDSU scored two runs in the top
half of the inning and pulled
away for an 11-1 victory to drop
the Cougars to 2-4 on the season.
On Saturday, SIUE continued
to struggle against the same three
teams. Southern Indiana picked
up the offense from the last game
as they out-hit SIUE 11-4. USI

COUCAR
SCOREBOARD

jumped out to a 3-0 lead after the
first inning and continued their
offensive dominance in downing
the Cougars 8-3. Southern
Indiana took their record to 11-0
on the season.
South Dakota State baffled the
Cougars again by coming away
with a 6-4 victory. Kim Wagner,
of Burbank, had a double, three
runs scored and a stolen base in
the
game
while
Jackson
contributed a base hit; an RBI and
swiped a base.
SIUE finally added a mark in
the win column in their second
game against North Alabama.
SIUE had a four-run first inning,
but North Alabama tied the game
after two innings. The Cougars
took a 6-4 advantage after scoring
runs in the third and fifth. A tworun seventh by North Alabama
tied the game again until SIUE
scored in the bottom half of the
seventh to gain the 7-6 victory.
Sollberger had three hits
which included a triple and a
home run. Niki Mitts, of Morton,
had two hits, two RBI and a
stolen base. Pekin native Erica
Connett had two hits and an RBI.
The
Cougars
travel
to
Columbus, Ga. to take on
Columbus
State
in
a
doubleheader on Friday before
going to Ocoee, Fla. for five days
o f com petition in the Rebel
Spring Games.

seemed to m isfire all at
once. Freshman Erica Cory and
senior Christina Loom is were
held
scoreless
and
senior
Leslie Phillips scored under
double digits.
Without knowing what kind of
talent they will have next year,
Hedberg says that the outlook is
uncertain with the loss of
Loomis, Phillips and Harkins.
“We haven’t signed anyone
yet,” Hedberg said. “But we will
know soon what kind of a team
we will have for next year.”

Irabu departed Legends Field

The incident occurred after

He returned moments later in

CARROLL
New England coach Pete
Carroll has broken his silence on
the arrest of running back Dave
M eggett, saying one incident
should not necessarily cause a
team to sever ties with a player.
Meggett was arrested Feb. 27
after a Toronto call girl told
police that he punched her and
took his money back when she
told him to stop having sex with

A l e s i l e

her when his condom broke.
The NFL’s career punt return
leader was charged with sexual
assault and robbery and released
on $5,250 bond. Another football
player, Steve Brannon o f the
Barcelona Dragons, was arrested
and charged with sexual assault.
BRONCOS
A giant pumpkin on the lake is
what some opponents have said
the new Cleveland Stadium will
look like with orange seats, but
that did not stop city planners
from choosing that color.
The city ’s D esign Review
Committee cast an advisory vote
on Thursday against the color,
but the Planning Commission
had the final say on Friday and
gave the OK for orange seats.
The exact shade o f orange had
not
been
selected.
The
commission said the color is part
of the Cleveland Browns legacy
and will work well with the
concrete,
stone
and
steel
structure of the new stadium.
The $247 million, 72,000-seat
stadium is expected to be
com pleted
by
A ugust
of
next year.
GIPPER
The football from the game
Notre Dame won for “the
Gipper” is still up for grabs.
A Seattle sports memorabilia
company, representing the owner
of the ball, unsuccessfully tried
to auction it by phone. The owner

T u e sd a y , M a rch 10, 1998 ♦

was asking a m inim um bid
of $100,000.
The ball was used during Notre
Dame’s 12-6 victory over Army
on Nov. 10, 1928.
In the most famous pep talk in
college sports, coach Knute
Rockne inspired the injuryriddled Irish by recalling George
G ipp’s deathbed request eight
years earlier: “... W hen the team
is up against it, when things are
wrong and the breaks are beating
the boys, tell them to go in there
with all they’ve got and win just
one for the Gipper.”
Rockne told his players, “This is
the day and you are the team.”

DAIGLE
Alexandre Daigle scored on a
breakaway with 56.5 seconds left
in overtime
to give the
Philadelphia Flyers a 4-3 victory
over the Pittsburgh Penguins on
Sunday night.
Daigle lifted the puck high over
goaltender Ken Wregget from the
middle of the slot for his first
goal as a Flyer.
Pittsburgh’s Jarom ir Jagr sent
the game into overtime, scoring
on a backhander from just
outside the right crease with 15
seconds left in regulation. Jagr’s
goal came with Wregget pulled
for an extra skater.
Just 31 seconds earlier, Shjon
Podein had put the Flyers ahead
by diving over a prone Wregget
and pushing the puck into the net.

Mike Sillinger and John LeClair
also scored for the Flyers, and
Rod Brind’Amour added three
assists. Brad Werenka and Martin
Straka also scored for Pittsburgh.
MODANO
Mike M odano’s goal with 6:35
left in regulation gave the Dallas
Stars a tie with Phoenix, keeping
the Coyotes winless in their last
nine games.
Phoenix took a 1-0 lead when
Teppo N um m inen’s slap shot
from the right point beat a
screened Ed Belfour with 11:31
rem aining
in
regulation.
Numminen’s seventh goal came
while the Coyotes were on their
seventh power play of the night.
But Dallas tied it on Modano’s
backhander from the slot, his
21st goal of the season.
Both goalies turned in strong
efforts, with D allas’ Ed Belfour
stopping
33
shots
while
Phoenix’s N ikolai K habibulin
had 22 saves Keith Primeau and
M artin G elinas scored 37
seconds apart on Carolina’s first
two shots of the game as the
H urricanes beat the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks.

Gary Roberts added his fifth
goal in five games and 14th of
the season on a breakaway at
13:35 of the third period and
Trevor Kidd made 21 saves to

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP)
— The matriarch of one of
Florida’s best-known families,
Ann Bowden, has been named
recipient of the initial “First Lady
of Football” by the All-American
Football Foundation.
She and Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden have been
married nearly 49 years and are
the parents o f six children,
including two college head
coaches. A son and son-in-law
are also assistant coaches in
Division I programs.
“W e’ve always thought of
ourselves
as
partners,”
Mrs. Bowden said Thursday.
“I’ve certainly been involved in
his business.
“We know all the things you
have to go through and put up
with,” she added. “I don’t know
how a coach runs a successful
program without a wife who
really helps him. A little fairy
doesn’t keep the logs burning and
the music playing.”
The foundation will honor
Mrs. Bowden, 65, at a banquet
March 16 in Tampa.

Break!!!
The staff of the Wellness
Center wishes fun for
everyone during spring
break. The following
safety tips are a reminder
for students, faculty, and
staff.
1. Never drink and drive!
2. If you drink, avoid binge drinking & never drink on an
empty stomach.
3. Avoid jail or steep fines by adhering to all laws relating to
alcohol use. Law enforcement is strict during Spring
Break.
4. Ladies, be careful with your drinks. Don’t leave drinks
unattended. Only drink beverages served directly to you
from employees of the establishment. Date rape drugs
are colorless, odorless, tasteless, and may be slipped
into your drink. Victims can't respond to or remember
the assault.
5. There is no substitute for sleep. Rolling your window
down, playing the radio, and drinking caffeine are only
temporary measures. Alternate drivers.
6. If you're under age, don’t panic! There are alcohol-free
drinks that look and taste like the real thing.
