SIUE left a mark on the
Internet world on Sept. 5, thanks
to a group o f locals from the
SIUE community, w ho have a
passion for space and astronomy.
Some alumni and students o f
SIUE recendy won the Parsec
Award for the Best Infotainm ent
Podcast, for a podcast they
created about the field o f
astronomy, titled “365 Days o f
Astronomy” or “365D oA .”
“365 DoA” is a series o f
podcasts, one produced daily by a
different expert or group w ith
knowledge o f the specific day o f
the year. This year marks the
400th anniversary o f the first
year Galileo used his telescope to
study the sky.
The award was given out at
the D ragon* C on convention
held in Adanta, Ga. The Parsec
Awards were started in 2006 to
celebrate podcasting o n a
national level. D ragon*C on is
one o f the largest multi-media,
pop-culture conventions held in
the United States. The focus o f
the convention is o n science
fiction and media that involves
topics related to any field o f
science in the U nited States.
“365DoA” was one o f five
finalists, after being selected from
a field o f 50 nom inated shows.
Fans nom inated the selected
podcasts, and the finalists were
chosen by a group o f judges.
Awards were given o u t in several
categories, ranging from best
audio quality to best content.
Podcasts produced by the
SIUE alumni and students have
had success in the past, but
nothing on this level. In 2007

and 2008, the same group
produced a podcast titled
“A stronom y Cast” and was a
finalist for the People’s Choice
Podcast Awards. This year,
however, marked the first year
that the group brought hom e a
prize.
Pamela Gay, the head o f the
“365DoA” project and a SIUE
professor
in
the
Physics
D epartm ent, said she was happy
w ith the result the podcast
earned.
“It was such a great feeling
to know that we had won. I was
shocked at first, just honestly
speechless,” Gay said. “I t’s
amazing to see how passionate
people around the w orld are
about the field o f astronomy.”
Gay also credited o ther
members in the group including
graduate
students
Preston
G ibson,
the
show ’s m ain
producer,
G eorgia
Bracey,
Kortney H ogan, and colleague
Nancy Atkinson, w ho acted as
the
project
manager.
U ndergraduate students D avid
Flateau, M ichael K oppelm an,
Emily Lakdawalla, Stuart Lowe,
M artin Ratcliffe and R o b ert
Simpson also contributed to the
project.
The team is responsible for
the audio and overall production
o f the podcasts they receive, all

equipm ent owned by SIUE.
Gay said the hard w ork o f
the entire team is w hat made the
project such a success.
“The astronomy com m unity
here is really tight-knit, and when
I was asked to be a part o f this, I
immediately said yes,” Gay said.

This fall, SIUE’s course m anagement system,
Blackboard, acquired several new features w ith its
update from version 6.3 to version 8.0.
According to the Inform ation Technology
Services Web site, Blackboard 8.0’s interface is
virtually the same, but the grade center and
discussion boards have acquired new features. ITS
made workshops and online tutorials available to
interested faculty members to help them transition
between Blackboard versions smoothly.
M any faculty m em bers have familiarized
themselves w ith the new system and identified its
added features. Mass communications professor
M usonda Kapatamoyo said the Blackboard’s new
enhanced features have increased its functionality.
“I can easily download paper assignments in the
grade center, grade them online and post grades
with comments w ithout printing a single paper,”
Kapatamoyo said.
Professor o f psychology Mike Dudley said not
much is different in terms o f posting items in
Blackboard 8.0.
“The new version does provide professors with
some pretty nifty assessment and evaluation tools,
however,” Dudley said.
According to mass communications professor

Tom Atwood, not all o f Blackboard 8.0’s updates
are positive.
“The main difference I have noticed is the new
version does n o t give students a running total o f
possible points during the semester, so it is more
difficult for them to see where they stand,” he said.
The new Blackboard still has a few kinks as well,
according to Dudley.
“Links work O K on some computers, but not
others, or [students] are sometimes prevented from
retaking self-assessments, which are set up to all
student to take them as many times as they like,”
Dudley said. “Overall, though, I definitely feel as
though the advantages o f Blackboard far outweigh
the m inor inconveniences it sometimes poses.”
Students and faculty have found that Blackboard
contributes both benefits and detrim ents to
teaching and learning. Individual faculty members
make decisions regarding the use o f Blackboard as a
classroom resource.
A professor in the Theatre and Dance
D epartm ent, Lex van
Blom m estein, said
Blackboard is an asset in lecture-based classes, but
not in all classes.
‘As a professor o f the arts, Blackboard isn’t
something that I use. It doesn’t have the personal
touch that the work my students produce need,” he
said

An opportunity for employment is coming to campus next week
when the Career Fairs return to SIUE.
The Career Fairs will occur on Tuesday Oct. 6 with the
Graduate School Fair with workshops from 10:30 a.m. to
12:30 p.m. The O ctober Career Fair will begin on Wednesday
and continue into Oct. 8. All fairs will be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Career Development Center office worker Bailey Conover said the various fairs are a way to shed
initial fears o f interviewing.
“The fairs help with nerves when you get to know an employer,” Conover said. “You can get an oncampus interview w hen some employers set up a later date in the office. They give interviewsbased on
resume and personality.”
Different focuses are on different days to help relieve heavy student traffic. Wednesday employers cater

Crimes on campus
decrease in 2008
by Rosie Githinji

Alestle Opinion Editor

Burglaries are on the rise but other crimes
remain stagnant, according to the annual security
report sent by e-mail to students.
Each year the university is required to send a
copy o f annual reports as mandated by the Jeanne
Clery Act, which requires by federal law, formerly
known as the Federal Student Right to Know and
Campus Security Act o f 1990.
The total num ber o f reported burglaries is
nine, going up from four in 2006 and 2007.
According to Lt. Kevin Schmoll, o f the SIUE police
departm ent, more burglaries are in the residential
areas o f Cougar Village and the residence halls.
There are also many types o f offenses that are
reported on the main campus and in the residential
areas, according to Schmoll.
“There are different crimes that occur in the
[residence] halls are underage drinking, unlawful
possession or some type o f verbal dispute,” Schmoll
said. “Really in the core area you do have some
thefts during the day. M ost com m on, day to day, is
theft anywhere on campus and are mosdy crimes o f
opportunity.”
The SIUE police departm ent also sends o u t emails and text messages to let students know what
they should be aware o f on campus, according to
Schmoll.
“Every m onth there is a crime tip that goes out
by e-mail,” Schmoll said. “If something occurs then
a safety bulletin is sent out.”
The text message alerts are being used more to
send students messages regarding events on
campus, and Schmoll said students have signed up

for it by the thousands. Schmoll also said the alerts
that are sent out are tailored to students, such as emails that are sent only to students on campus or in
a particular residence hall.
Senior political science and history major Cory
Bosco o f East Alton does not live on campus, but
spends a lot o f his time on it. H e said he feels safe
on campus any time o f the day or night.
“During the day I think nothing o f it because
there are so many people around,” Bosco said. “I t’s
just when I am walking down to parking lot 7, it is
always really eerie. There is not that much lighting
and there is nobody out there.”
Bosco said there should be more patrols on
campus.
“W hat I would like to see is more o f a presence
o f cops patrolling at night,” Bosco said. “I do think
we have one o f the safest campuses in the area.”
Senior manufacturing engineer major Yonatan
Gebre o f Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, said there have
been times when he spent the night on campus,
even though he does not live in one o f the
residential areas.
“Around the buildings its pretty safe,” Gebre
said. “The farther off you get, past the engineering
building and the dorms, it m ight not be as safe.”
Gebre said there is not enough lighting and he
would not try' to walk from the campus to Cougar
Village during the night, but he does not feel
unsafe. H e said that if the high traffic areas should
have more o f a police presence.
“Usually if you walk around the main campus
area, it feels pretty safe,” Gebre said. “I think I feel
safe on campus.”

that everyone put in, and the success is just a testament to all o f our
hard day's o f work. I have people from Harvard and Oxford
University' ask me where these students are from, and when I tell
them SIUE, they are blown away. These small groups o f students are
only the tip o f the great science community we have here on
campus.”
The podcast episodes are written, recorded and produced daily
by people around the world. Each day has a specific topic or theme
based on the 365 Days o f Astronomy calendar, a daily calendar o f
astronomical events, themes and ideas created by the International
Year o f Astronomy'. Pamela Gay is an active member and is credited
with much o f the projects that are taking place.
Nancy Atkinson, the project manager o f “365DoA,” said the
whole process has been one experience w orth taking part in.
“It’s been great to meet people from around the world who
contribute to this project we started,” Atkinson said. “We just put
the word out there and the response we received was from a
tremendous am ount o f people.”
According to IYA’s Web site, even though each episode differs
daily, they all tie into the overall theme, which is the love and
appreciation o f astronomy.
For example, Tuesday’s podcast came from Harold Goldner, a
lawyer from Pennsylvania who has been looking out his telescope
since he was 6 years old. In Goldner’s podcast, the issue o f legality
on whether or not anyone should be allowed to blast off into space
is discussed in the 10-minute long audio production.
“I think about life outside o f the world, and what lies beyond
what we can see with a telescope,” Goldner says in his podcast. “I
wonder constantly if it is morally right to try and find w hat is out
there, or just leave the beauty' o f space alone.”
Goldner is one o f the many' types o f people IYA is encouraging
to be a part o f the daily updates.
According to their Web site, “anyone with something to say
about astronomy in grades K-12, college and graduate students, and
even professionals in the respected field should step up.”
More information about these events and IYA in general can be
found at www.astronomy2009.us and www.astronomy'2009.org.

D udley said, he “can’t
imagine w hy a professor on

w ould
not
use
Blackboard.
“From
a
course
management perspective, it is
extremely helpful to provide
students w ith a one-stop
resource for course materials —
notes, links, announcem ents,
assignments, grades, etc.”
D udley said his students
“always know that anything they
need for the class can be found
on Blackboard.”

Blackboard in his classes.
“It keeps a track record o f
my discussions, assignm ents,
grades, course m aterials and
PowerPoints for all w ho have
access to check at any tim e,”
Kapatamoyo said. “ [Students]
can never get lost w ith course

“I think all teachers should
have [Blackboard] because if
they have it then we can print
their notes o ff it,” Mansfield
said. “My economy teacher uses
it. I print her notes off because
she
goes
through
her
PowerPoint slides so fast.”
Another
widely-used
Blackboard feature is the grade center.
“[Student's] grades are kept
current so students can always

gauge how well they are doing in
the course,” Dudley said. “Using
the grade book also helps me
identify when particular students
may be having trouble with the
course, so I can then contact
them and arrange a meeting to
try to bring the performance
back up to the level they would
like.”
A tw ood said the grade
center also helps avoid grading
mistakes.
“It
also
helps
avoid
confusion and clarify errors in
posting grades,” Atwood said. “I
like for all grades to be available
where I can see them, and the
students can see them , so if there
is an error, or typo, it can be
corrected quickly instead o f at
the end o f the semester.”
A tw ood said there are
drawbacks to online grade books
also.
“It does take some time to
post
grades
for
each
assignm ent,” A tw ood said.
“Som etim es in the past, the
server seems to be extremely
slow, which makes the process
take even longer. It would be
easier to just keep the grades in
m y grade book, but I feel like it
is w orth the time it takes to post
them online.”
Another popular Blackboard
feature is the ability to organize
assignm ents,
according
to
Dudley.
“I use Blackboard not only
as a resource for students, but
also to assign reading quizzes,

which
students
take
on
Blackboard, and even selfassessments in preparation for
exams,” Dudley said.
W hile online assignments
are a positive feature for some
students and faculty, others
consider this feature a negative
one. Senior math major Josh
Jackson said it is a pain to have
online homework and interactive
assignments instead o f physical
one.
“Especially if you have
In tern et problem s, it’s just
frustrating,” Jackson said.
Senior psychology m ajor
N ate Geist said he does not think
Blackboard should replace work
done in the actual classroom.
“ [Teachers] should not rely
too heavily on the system to
communicate class work. I f I
w anted to rely on electronic
systems to earn class credit, I’d
take an online course. I expect
the majority o f my learning and
communication to come while in
the classroom because that is
what I’m paying for.”
Geist also said Blackboard
should not be overused.
“ [Blackboard] w ould be
better used if it was even used
less,” Geist said. “I think
Blackboard should be for posting
o f grades and notes and syllabus
only,” he said.

to School o f Business and College
Arts & Sciences, while Thursday
is for engineers.
“The fairs are extremely
helpful,” Conover said. “There’s
usually a pretty big turn-out, and
even if a student doesn’t get an
on-campus interview, it’s a way to
network themselves.”
According to the Director of
Career Development Center Jean
Paterson, career fairs are a pastime
o f college campuses, and the fairs
cycle along with the economy.
“[The economy] has affected
us. It always does,” Paterson said.
“We’ve seen the ups and downs on
a cycle, and as the economy goes
back up, it’ll go back up.”
However, according to office
workers, the changing economy
naturally results in hiring freezes,
or pauses on professional job
availability because that’s how it is
set up.
“They were doing [career
fairs] in the 1970s,” Office
Support
Associate
Letitia
Schumacher said. “In the ‘80s, we
were lucky to have 50 companies,
but then our contact system
changed a lot. You can’t even
judge it this year because o f the
economy. We have 98 companies
registered and spread out over
two days so far. In recent years
we’ve had as many as 200.”
Despite the current less-than
successful economy, career fairs
still have other purposes aside
from hiring, and therefore, bring
in an efficient turnout.
“I’ve been here for 15 years,”

Paterson said, “and the career fairs
have grown even with the bad
economy. It was n o t a huge
decrease at the moment, and there
are jobs out there.”
One suggested genre o f
em ploym ent remains w ith a
company involved in everyday
lifestyle.
“I f a student is not looking
into
federal
em ploym ent,”
Paterson said, “they’re missing
out. The government is looking to
replace the baby boomers. There’s
a lot o f opportunities for students
such as internships, co-ops and
full-time hire at graduation.”
Another fair is the Health
Careers Fair on Nov. 16 from 3 to
6 p.m. in the Morris University
Center’s Meridian Ballroom as
well. Also, career fairs not
endorsed by SIUE may present on
campus in the future.
“It lets employers see what
SIUE is made of, and lets students
look at employers that they might
n o t ordinarily think about,”
Schumacher said.
The Career D evelopm ent
Center can be reached at 6503708 and offers a variety o f
“crash-courses” for inexperienced
students in a professional sense.
“You can’t sit back and wait,”
Paterson said. “Everyone should
come prepared and talk to an
employer. You have to have a co­
op or internship before you
graduate. This will help.”

Hispanic Heritage Month largely ignored by SIUE
The contributions and cultures of
Americans of Spanish, Mexican, Caribbean
and Central or South American descent are
celebrated in the United States each year
during Hispanic Heritage M onth. On
campuses across America, including our
Carbondale counterpart,
students will learn about
prom inent Latino and
Hispanic culture through
guest speakers, dance
lessons,
musical
performances,
film
screenings, photography
exhibits and other such
cultural activities.
SIUE
students,
however, may not even be
aware that Sept.
15
through Oct. 15 is national
Hispanic Heritage Month.
A performance by
Teatro Milagro, sponsored by the Department
o f Foreign Languages, is listed on the
university’s events page as “part of Hispanic
Heritage M onth.” Though the implication is
that other activities will be taking place to
commemorate H H M , a search for other events
turned up no matches.

The university’s inactivity is surprising
given that Latinos, which make up 15.9
percent of Illinois population, have been at the
forefront of the nation’s cultural and political
landscape during the past year.
Henry Cejudo, son o f Mexican

Alestle Managing Editor

In an auditorium with the lights dimmed, students
found courage to speak into a microphone and reveal their
darkest secrets to 800 o f their peers.
Their confessions Tuesday night ranged from
sneaking into the show to feeling responsible for the death
o f their 6-year-old cousin.
The secrets were shared in the Meridian Ballroom as
part o f the project PostSecret, an event where anyone is
invited to share their deepest secrets. Creator, Frank
Warren, given the tide o f the “most trusted stranger in
America,” started the PostSecret idea as an art project five
years ago. The idea was to have people send their darkest
secrets anonymously on a postcard to Warren. Since then,
it has taken a life o f its own, accumulating 400,000 to
500,000 postcards, Warren said.
“To me it seems like a really simple idea, nothing
complicated,” Warren said. “Just mail me your secrets.”
H e was not intending for PostSecret to live beyond
the initial idea o f the project, but the idea had become
infectious for those w ho had filled o u t the initial
anonymous postcards.
“N o t too long into the project, I stopped passing out
the postcards. I thought that would be the end, but the
secrets kept coming,” Warren said. “That’s when I realized
I had tapped into something that had been there the
whole time.”
PostSecret has now evolved into a live tour, where
people can share their secrets openly with the rest o f the
audience. Warren said the experience can help people face
their secrets and begin a healing process.
“This is my favorite part o f the project now, meeting
the people face-to-face w ho have sent me postcards,”
Warren said. “It’s a powerful thing for everyone who
attends, to see your classmates expose themselves and
become vulnerable, whether it’s eating disorders or
academic pressure, abuse, a sexual secret or a funny secret.
It can create a spirit that lives beyond the event itself.”

INVENTION

"LYING
FROM THE CO-CREATOR OF THE OFFICE AND EXTRAS

OCTOBER 2

M ark Bellison has a power no one in his world
can even fathom. H e has the ability to lie.
“The Invention o f Lying” is a story about a
man who lives in a reality where people do not
understand the concept o f lying. Everyone speaks
the truth, even when it is hurtful to others, and does
not seem to Understand why they should sometimes
not say w hat is on their minds.
The movie has a few sad moments, which are
quickly overrun with comedic relief, making you
w onder why they bothered scripting a serious
m om ent in the first place. The characters are
engaging, somewhat naive and leave the viewer
wanting more personality.
Bellison (Ricky Gervais) is a man down on his
luck and not very good at his job. There are no
prospects in the romance departm ent because he is
not a good-looking guy.
His love interest in the movie, Anna (Jennifer
Garner), refuses to give Bellison a chance even
though he has a good personality. She feels that
since Bellison is not a strong genetic match, one o f
the things she is looking for in her marriage, they
could never work out.
Bellison does not have many friends because a
lot o f his neighbors and fellow workers see him and
automatically label him a loser.
The first lie told by Bellison happens when he
is asked a question and instead o f giving the true
answer, answers with w hat he would like it to be.
Since there are no repercussions from the initial lie,
Bellison goes on to experiment with his newfound
abilities and discovers no one else in the world has
any idea he is not being truthful.
The movie follows Bellison as he climbs up the
ladder to fame and fortune because o f his ability to

lie. As more and more people begin to believe that
w hat he says is gospel, Bellison finds he is still not
happy because he does not w ant to lie to get the
woman he loves.
The movie is full o f subtle allusions to biblical
references, like using “the man in the sky” when
referring to God and using old pizza boxes in the
same
m anner as M oses
and
the Ten
Commandments, It also shows w hat the world
would be w ithout propaganda.
It is a little hard to suspend disbelief while
watching this movie, as one does when watching
something with aliens or talking animals in it.
There are no advertisements proclaiming why
one is better than the other, or politicians using lies
to find their way into office. Movies consist o f
people reading stories from history instead o f actors
portraying different characters conjured from the
imagination o f writers.
The characters in the movie freely speak their
mind, which is amusing at times, but there is a lack
o f imagination. The conversation is witty and
sarcastic, but in a subtle way, making it hard to
understand at various points in the movie.
Gervais delivers his lines with a dry humor, but
n o t as well as some o f his co-stars. Garner’s
character portrays an innocence that is a little
insulting to women because, even though she is a
strong businesswoman, she is not able to stand up
for herself and give her ow n thoughts and opinions.
“The Invention o f Lying” is an easy laugh that
does not require much brainpower to follow along.
The trailers did not promise much, so it was not as
disappointing as expected.

VC floor gets upgrade after incident
by Allan Lewis

Alestle Sports Editor

Hunter Creel/Alestle

The bleachers in the Vadalabene Center are moved as crews work to
replace the floor underneath Tuesday. A storm in May caused water
to flood onto the floor through an opening left by a roof contractor.

After heavy rains blasted through a tarp
closing off the Vadalabene Center’s roof in May
damaging its year-old playing surface, installation
o f a new performance floor is almost complete.
R oof contractor Lorenz and Associates o f St.
Louis is being held liable for the $250,000
replacement, after their storm protection system
failed during a campus-wide roofing project.
The floor is scheduled for completion Oct.
15, right on time with the university’s plan.
According to Assistant Vice Chancellor for
Administration Rich Walker, a consultant came
into the gym and conducted a moisture analysis
test on the floor shortly after the accident,
revealing the need for replacement.
“There was moisture throughout the wood
on the floor and water sitting on top o f the
concrete below the floor,” Walker said. “The
results were worse in the east end o f the
performance area where the water came in, but
you can’t replace half the floor and expect it to still
be playable.”
The floor inside the Vadalabene Center is
characterized as a “sprung floor,” meaning it is
raised rather than flat, and sits atop a bed o f
springs, allowing water to seep underneath the
playing surface.
Walker said the project is 85 percent
complete, and the new floor will be an upgrade
from the one previously installed and feature a
lighter grade o f wood.

Club bowling looks to
cash in on new year
by T.J. Cowell

Alestle Sports Reporter

With more than a dozen tournaments
scheduled, the SIUE Club Bowling team
will continue to make strides in the school
record books for the upcom ing 20092010 season. Last year, SIUE finished
with a national team ranking in the top
40’s.
As Club president, senior B rett
Hinnen is in charge o f arranging SIU E’s
lineup for tournaments.
“I started out as a freshman and
progressively, each year, we have moved
higher into the rankings,” H innen said. “I
have got a lot o f hard-working guys. I
think this is the strongest team we have
had since I have been here.”
According to H innen, a maximum o f
five bowlers can start a match in a single
game in the tournam ent. Substitutions are
allowed during m atch play, but that
bowler must sit out for the remainder o f
the game.
W ith a squad consisting o f four
freshmen, four sophomores, tw o juniors
and three seniors, Club Treasurer Dave
Sweet said SIUE Club Bowling continues
to grow.
“I think our program is headed in the
right direction,” Sweet said. “We have all
o f our starters returning this year. All I can

see is bigger and better things in the
future.”
Sweet said a goal for this year’s
Cougar squad will be looking to “cash” as
m uch as possible. Depending on the size
o f the tournam ent, cashing happens when
a team finishes high enough in the
rankings that they get their tournam ent
entry fees back along with a little extra
funding. Hinnen said this funding helps
SIUE Club Bowling financially.
“There are usually around 30 o f 40
teams at tournam ents,” Sweet said.
“Getting to travel is a thrill in itself. You
have to strive to be that team.”
SIU E Club Bowling reached a
milestone for the program last year by
making match play for the first time in
school history. The Cougars will start their
season off with an appearance at the
H am m er MidWest Collegiate Classic on
Saturday and Sunday in Wauwatosa, Wis.
H innen said this weekend’s tournam ent
features nine o f the top 10 schools and 16
o f the top 18 bowlers in the nation.
“Overall, the com petition is going to
be a lot harder this year,” junior and Club
Vice President Blake Badillo said. “This
weekend will set the tone for the rest o f the
season. If we place in the top 10 or 15
teams, th at is going to be a big
m om entum booster.”
BOW LIN G/pg.9

east and west end is complete, and the bleachers
are back in place,” Walker said. “The under­
flooring on the south end is in, and the top layer
w ent on Monday. Soon, they will switch over to
the north end o f the performance court, and once
that is complete, seal the paint.”
Sum m er sports camps, as well as the
volleyball team’s first home game o f the season,
were displaced due to the floors level o f playability
and construction.
Volleyball H ead Coach Todd Gober said
while it has been an inconvenience, the university,
as well as his team, are making the m ost out o f the
situation.
“The big thing is you w ant to be able to
practice more in the place you play,” Gober said.
“We will be in the Fitness Center again (Monday)
against Western (Illinois University), and we are
taking steps to prepare for whatever situation
arises if the floor is done.”
Gober said the administration has handled the
inconvenience well, and the new Student Activities
Center is a good substitute for the time being.
“O ur fans and administration really made a
great impression,” Gober said about his team’s
Sept. 23 game against Evansville held at the SAC.
The new floor will provide added benefits in
terms o f quality, according to Gober.
“Knees, ankles and backs .don’t buckle as
much on an upgraded floor,” Gober said. “W hen
you talk about an upgrade in quality, that is great
for our athletes.”

ESPN gives SIUE shot
at BracketBusters
by T J . Cowell

Alestle Sports Reporter

The SIUE men’s basketball team will
take their next step toward making school
history by com peting in the eighth
annual BracketBusters event on Feb. 19
and 20.
The two-day experience is part o f the
ESPN college basketball franchise. O f the
98 schools selected to take part in
BracketBusters, SIUE is listed as an away
team.
“It is a very exciting thing,” SIUE
men’s basketball H ead Coach Lennox
Forrester said. “It is another way to get
the university exposure and be known.”
The Cougars will find out their
opponent on Feb. 1 when matchups are
announced. All 11 members o f the Ohio
Valley Conference are scheduled to take
part in BracketBusters. O ther schools
com peting are members o f American
East, Big Sky, Big South, Big West,
Colonial, H orizon, M etro Atlantic, M id­
American, M issouri Valley, M EAC,
Southern, Summit and Western Athletic
conferences.
BracketBusters was named because
o f the success o f its teams in tournam ent
play. The event will see 11 games
televised nationally, with five contests on
ESPN U and six on ESPN 2. Netw ork

assignm ents for the games will be
announced on Feb. 1. According to a
press release by espnbracketbusters.com,
teams participating in BracketBusters
have made 89 appearances in the last six
NCAA tournaments.
Included in that list was a 2006
Bradley University squad w ho made it to
the Sweet Sixteen after knocking off the
U niversity o f Kansas and Pittsburgh
University, respectively in the first and
second rounds o f that year’s NCAA
tournament. At the time, Forrester served
as an assistant coach at Bradley, where
according to Forrester, he worked with
the Braves’ post and perimeter players.

Badillo said the team trains hard both in and out o f the alley to build chemistry. Since SIUE Club
Bowling does not offer scholarships, Badillo said there is a lot o f fundraising that has to be done within
the program.
“There is a lot o f stress. We are not able to hire a coach or anything,” Badillo said. “The more guys we
get in there the less pressure there is o ff us.”
Despite the individual success the Cougars have had during the years, H innen said his squad is based

“It was an awesome feeling while I was at
Bradley and a great run,” Forrester said. “We will
have the same feeling.”
Although SIUE is still not eligible to compete
in the NCAA tournam ent, the Cougars can qualify
for three other postseason tournam ents including
the National Transition Tournament, the College
Basketball Invitational and the CollegeInsider.com
Tournament. Forrester said his team will look to
make a postseason run.
“We have a tremendous opportunity to do
something special,” Forrester said. “Right now we
are working very hard. All I w ant these young men
to do is compete.”
Forrester said that on paper, this year’s Cougar
squad looks bigger, but may not be as quick or
athletic as compared to last year’s team. SIUE will
use their size to grab more boards this year, as
Forrester said rebounding was an Achilles heel o f
his team a season ago.

“BracketBusters is more o f a chance to play
schools that you would otherwise have trouble
scheduling,” Forrester said. “A purpose o f
BracketBusters is it gives Selection Sunday teams
the upper hand.”
As part o f the agreement involved within
BracketBusters, whomever SIUE faces on Feb. 19
or 20 will play a game at the Vadalabene Center in
N ovem ber or December o f 2011.
Throughout the year, SIUE will play teams
during its regular season that will also compete in
BracketBusters. Forrester said his team will be ready
to fight when the time comes.
“These schools that we are playing are pretty
good,” Forrester said. “I f you cannot get up for
games like this, I do n o t know w hat you can get
excited for.”
SIUE opens its exhibition season against
MacMurray College on Nov. 4 at the Vadalabene
Center.
