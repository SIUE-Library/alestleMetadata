Angels descend on SIUE
BY JOHN KLIMUT
NEWS STRINGER
You can be an angel this
holiday season.
Members of the University
Police D epartm ent are again
sponsoring an Angel Tree. The
tree will have angel decorations
and each angel has the Christmas
wishes of a child living in

Cougar Village.
The tree will be put up Nov.
25 in the Goshen Lounge of the
Morris University Center.
The Angel Tree will be used
to distribute Christmas presents
to any child in Cougar Village
under the age of 16. Entry forms,
which ask basic inform ation
about the child, are available
from Brandi
Kirkbride
at

University Housing or Cheryl
Huber at the police department.
All angel entries are due by Nov.

An angel will be numbered
to correspond to a given child and
then be placed on the tree. Except
for three Christmas wishes, all
information about the child is
kept confidential.

the

University Center Board.
Chancellor D avid Werner
was on hand and called
International Night one of the
highlights of the academic year.
“It is important for American
students to have the opportunity
to get to know more about other
cultures,” Werner said.
The chancellor noted that the
international student population
has increased by more than 10

percent since last year and now
stands at 297 students.
“We are working to further
increase
the
international
population at SIUE. Next fall,
international students’ tuitions
will decrease by one-third,”
Werner said.
The program featured an

SET student directs theater dreams

Jermey IndelicatoMfesf/e

Myah Shaw directs an SET
production for the One-Act
festival on Wednesday.
BY KATHRYN MARTIN
FOR THE ALESTLE
Facing fears, dreaming and
writing plays are all part of^.22year-old Myah S haw ’s daily
routine.
This is not the typical SIUE
student’s agenda.
However,
Shaw is not your typical SIUE
student.
As a transfer student from St.
Louis Com m unity College at
Florissant Valley, she had trouble
getting into SIUE dife to her

college test scores. In her words,
“God pulled some strings” and
she was accepted.
Shaw is now a theater
production major and a creative
writing minor in her junior year
at SIUE. She is doing well in her
studies due mostly to the passion
she has for them.
Shaw said she has known she
wanted to be an actress since she
was seven years old. Her mother,
one of her greatest influences in
her life, encouraged this desire
when Shaw stated, “Mommy, I
want to be a cash register.”
Her mother replied, “Myah,
you should be an actress - then
you can be anything you want to
be.”
In addition to her mother,
Shaw said God and Jesus are
great inspirations for her life. She
believes that God puts a
challenge in front of her every
day. Through his strength and her
own, she feels she gets through
each of them.
Another inspiration for Shaw
is Ntozake Shange, the writer of
the play “For Colored Girls Who
Have Considered SuicideAVhen
the Rainbow Is Enuf.” This play

was so inspiring to Shaw that she
wrote her own piece paralleling
the Shange work, retitled “This is
For All Girls That Have
Considered Suicide W hen the
Rainbow Wasn’t Enuf!”
The original play follow s
seven women’s lives as they have
experiences from abuse to
obesity and learn and grow from
them.Shaw’s piece also follows
the lives of seven women, but
their experiences are more
applicable to the lives of all
women, not just those of black
women.
Shaw’s play was chosen for
the One-Act Festival at the
M etcalf Student Experim ental
Theater. The festival lets students
be director for their self-written
plays. Shaw gets to run auditions,
design the sets and perform all
the tasks that go with directing a
play. Her show will be performed
at 7:30 p.m. W ednesday and
Thursday in the M etcalf SET at
SIUE, and is free o f charge to the
public.
In addition to being a
playwright and a student, Shaw is
a member of the SET Committee.

SIUE receives state award
BY KIM O ’BRECHT
NEWS STRINGER
SIU E’s
Environmental
Health and Safety department has
been cited by Illinois Gov. Jim
Edgar as one of 23 organizations
honored for preventing pollution.
The award recognizes the
efforts o f the departm ent in
establishing a chemical exchange
program that recycles materials.
David M cD onald, head
o f Environm ental Health and

Safety at SIUE, began the
program in 1992.
“The cost for hazardous
waste kept going up, and we were
running out of money and having
a hard time trying to dispose of
unwanted chemicals,” McDonald
said. “At the same time people in
some areas had a need for them,
but they couldn’t afford them. So
it seemed like a good opportunity
to put these chem icals in the
hands of other qualified people,”
he said.

Slumlords to the World
In Richard W right’s novel, “Native Son,” a black
boy from the south side of Chicago murders a white
woman. Because it took place during the 1930s, he is
hunted down by a mob of angry policemen and volunteers
who comb the black section of Chicago. The irony of the
Danielle story is that the murderer, Bigger Thomas, is a product of
Belton the slum which is owned by the family of the victim. This
same family gives generous donations to black colleges,
but doesn't acknowledge the role they play in the destruction of the
lives of people who live in the slum. Nor do they realize their
contribution to the murder of their own daughter by helping to create
Bigger Thomas.
The family owned hundreds of slums that housed blacks all over
Chicago. The family lived far away from that world yet lived in
constant fear and guilt that someday the people they oppressed
would come back to haunt them. I see this as a direct analogy for
Americans and the developing world.
Americans are an anomaly. There has never been a force like us
upon this earth. We’re like the Roman Empire, only we don’t need
armies to conquer the world, just technology. We don’t need
missionaries to spread our influence and culture, we have music,
movies and television for that. If the United Nations wants to pass a
piece of legislation and Americans don’t like it, it may not get passed
or it may not get enforced. It is frightening to think of the power we
hold and even more frightening to imagine someone else having that
power.
We own power and influence in nearly every country in the
world. We use our power. And we abuse our power — just like any
other slumlord. That’s us, the Americans, Slumlords to the World.
The slums we watch over are in the developing world. We watch
the poorer countries with an accusatory eye. We wait for them to get
out of line, then we try to destroy them. We have power and
influence in these countries. So much power, we have been known to
try to incite a revolution or two and overthrow a few leaders to put
in ones more favorable to us. We build our smokestacks just high
enough so the pollution misses us and flows into Canada. And if a
few people get killed so we can get our way, we do it. Iraq and Cuba
are perfect examples.
Saddam Hussein is turning into the new Fidel Castro. Every U.S.
president since Kennedy has declared he would be the one to get rid
of Castro and his regime. Castro is still in Cuba and just recently we
apparently decided to stop trying to remove him. Saddam is getting
the Castro treatment. In our haste to get rid of him, w e’ve placed
economic sanctions on his country and are now threatening him with
air strikes. The Iraqis are hardly going to fight back and we know it.
Economic sanctions have done nothing except increase the bitterness
the Middle East has toward the United States. Saddam isn’t going
anywhere, yet we fear him. As Bigger Thomas caused unease, we
fear Saddam and other underdeveloped countries because they might
bring terrorism to our shores. Knowing that they are unable to start a
war, they will just blow up our embassies or plant bombs in our
airports instead. Movies like “True Lies,” “Under Siege,” “Die
Hard” and the new movie, “The Siege,” point to this fear Americans
have of terrorism.
The fact that Americans control the world, yet at the same time
act as if they want nothing to do with it when trouble comes around,
is what is causing the fear of terrorism. Just like during the
Reconstruction when the Klan preached the fear of raping-andmurdering blacks coming in the night, Americans reel in fear of the
terrorists we helped to create.
We enter their countries, we tell them what to do, we put people
we like in charge then try to get those same people out. We ignore
injustice, then leave our weapons from the Cold War in their
countries so they can wage war. From Libya to Liberia, to the Congo
to Rwanda, in Egypt, Iraq and Iran and back again, w e’ve stuck our
noses into countries, used them for what we needed, then abandoned
them. Our only lasting gift seems to be that we leave an arsenal of
weapens with a despot in charge. Then we watch them in mock
horror, wagging our fingers and saying look at the little savages
slaughtering each other in the street. We think how we are so much
better, then we fear their terrorism. Not too long ago Saddam was our
friend, a leader we helped pick. It was during the ’80s when Iran was
our enemy and Saddam and the Ayatollah were at war. Our hatred of
the Ayatollah and Iran became love for Iraq. It’s funny how things
have changed.
There was a reason why so many blacks were lynched from the
height of slavery up to the Civil Rights movement. It was the fear of
black terrorism in the form of slave revolts and riots combined with
the guilt of knowing that whites could blame only themselves for the
aggression and fear.
The same thing Southern society did to the African-American,
we have done to the world. We made the world what it is today and
we help perpetuate the poverty and strife of many countries. We
aren’t trying to oust a dictator in Iraq, we are trying to eradicate a
fear. We are trying to drown out our guilt with oppression and
violence. We still think the way to control our darkest fears is by
hanging dead carcasses from trees. Until we act more responsibly as
the No. 1 influence in the world, we will never be able to avoid the
violence that comes with being the Slumlord of the World.

Alii Khat is not a licensed therapist >
and her advice should only be taken seriously if
you are very desperate, or make numerous phone
calls to psychic hot lines.
Dear Alii Khat,
I dated this guy fo r 2 1/2 years.. For the first year and a half we were madly in
love. Passing through the second year, we were happy; however, we got
somewhat bored with each other. We broke up fo r about two months and then got
back together before I came down here to school. After I was away fo r three
months, he decided he liked someone else. I was crushed but appreciated
my freedom. Now 1 want him back. I feel like we were destined to be together.
How can I get him back? Missin’ Him Missy
Dear Missin ’ Him Missy,
Everybody grows a strong attachment to their high school sweetheart, especially after dating fo r 2
1/2 years. However, how can you be sure he’s the one true man fo r you unless you date many,
many others? Often times when a guy sees his ex-girl dating other guys, he tends to realize what
h e ’s missing out on. I f your ex is really sentimental, nag at his emotions. Send him cards'with
pictures o f the two o f you together, write him poems and play emotional songs in the background
while you talk to him on the phone. These things may make him come to the realization quicker.
Dear Alii Khat,
I am having such a rough time. I can’t seem to choose between two guys. One is my best friend
and I love him to death. The other I just met and he is great too. I don’t want to hurt either one.
How can I choose? What should I do? 2MuchLuv
Dear 2MuchLuv,
You have lots o f things to think about. For instance, would taking your relationship with your best
friend to the next step cause distress in the future, or do you love him enough to make the
relationship more serious? How well do you know this other guy and would he be good to you?
Then there are the obvious questions to ask yourself, such as which one is cuter, which one is
wealthier and which one drives a nicer car! These are all things fo r you to think about!
