The wait for more computers may be long
Leasing is one option open to students
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor

By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor

Students living in Tower Lake A partm ents, eager to get
access to a com puter, will have to learn the fine art of patience.
According to Michael Schultz, university housing director,
there is no quick solution to getting m ore com puters. H e said
the subject was discussed at last w eek’s University Housing
Advisory C om m ittee m eeting but that he and Jay Sterrit, dean
of Lovejoy Library, had to develop a plan to address certain
issues.
“H ousing ju st provides th e space. T he com puters
themselves fall under Academ ic A ffairs,” Schultz said.
He said some of the item s the com m ittee wants to address
are:
• m ore com puters in the Residence Hall and Tower Lake
• a laser printer in both labs — right now there are only dot
m atrix printers available.
• expanding the space, possibly to upstairs in the loft.
• a lab attendant, but “with the lab being open 24 hours a
day, that may present a problem .”
• funding for com puters.
The com m ittee will continue to discuss viable options in the
until further developm ent is made.
Editor’s Note: The A les tie was unable to contact Sterrit, before
publication deadline.

W aiting for a com puter is not the way
m ost students want to spend their time.
O ften on a tight budget and juggling jobs and
classes, plunking down a few grand for a
personal com puter isn’t an option for the
average freshman.
But there is a ray of hope in a dark
situation: leasing a computer.
Insight D irect, Inc., a com pany which
leases com puters to businesses, thought it
would be a good idea to initiate a program
for students. The com pany believes it offers
the first program of this kind.
“We lease to business custom ers and
thought it would be good to offer the same
service to college students,” Susan Heywood,
spokeswom an for the company, said. “Most
students would benefit from having a computer
of their own.”
N ot all students can walk into a store and
buy a com puter, even with today’s easy
financing. She said the program is also a

good way for younger students to establish
credit.
The com pany is a direct m arketer of IBM
com patibles. They offer som e M acintosh
item s — hardw are, software and m em ory

Students strutted their stuff on the catwalk in the Goshen Lounge yesterday as part of a '70s
fashion show. The fashion show was only one of various activities planned for this week
celebrating Homecoming.

. S tudents are running, sw atting, jum ping and
screaming in a local version of the bee dance. Som eone
call the O rkin man, SIU E is being invaded by bees.
“Actually, it’s the E aster Yellow Jacket that is causing
so much grief, and cooler w eather is the only thing that
will get rid of the aggressive p ests,” Tom R oyer,
extension ed u c ato r w ith the U niversity of Illinois
C ooperative Extension Service and an entom ologist by
trade, said.
“Yellow jackets d o n ’t over-winter as a colony,” R oyer
said. “The queen will leave to over-winter in another area
and come back in spring to start a new colony. But until
the w eather gets colder, they w on’t becom e less active
and die out.”

N. C. Faw was pronounced dead at William Beaumont Hospital in
Royal Oak, Mich, about 7 p.m. Kevorkian's attorney, Geoffrey

Rival South African parties rally to end violence
REUTERS — Leaders of two rival black South African parties
made a rare appearance Sunday, urging people to end bloodshed
between the two groups. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of the Inkatha
Freedom Party and Jacob Zuma, national chairman of the African
National Congress, met in Stanger, in the troubled province of
KwaZulu-Natal. They met at a ceremony commemorating the 1828
assassination of King Shaka, who is regarded by many Zulus to be
the founder of their nation. About 15,000 people have been killed in
the region over the past decade in fighting fueled by rivalry between
the two groups.

BELLEVILLE — Stiff competition is ahead for graduates
of Illinois’ aviation electronics, maintenance technology
and pilot training programs,according to a new state
report. The report casts a pall over community college
aviation programs in Illinois, including the one at
Belleville Area College in Granite City.
The Illinois Community College Board released the
report last week and showed that, while graduates had low
unemployment rates, they were often working in fields
unrelated to their studies.
BAC President Joe Cipfl said the findings back up what
he’s been saying, that the programs’ decreasing enrollment
figures warranted shutting down the programs in 1997. But
BAC instructors and students say the aviation job market
is bouncing back and so will enrollment figures.
BAC aviation maintenance technology coordinator
Gregg Sweeten didn’t question the report’s findings, but
believes it is outdated.
Pilot training programs were also studied and the report
cited a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projection “that
there will be considerable competition for aircraft pilots,
navigators and private pilots through 2005”.

F e m in is t j o u r n a l i s t s p e a k s o u t :
Last Thursday, the Alestle
ran a letter to the editor from
four wom en in the Historical

departm ents.

The au th o rs n o ted several
lines/paragraphs

wom en negatively.
A lthough the news editor
spoke w ith one of the
professors last week, I believe
a few points need to be m ade
regarding that story.
First of all, surely the
authors didn’t think we lowly
students had enough status to
be reporting m urder stories.
So, second, I have to adm it we

quickest to rew rite. W e’re

A nd no, I d o n ’t think the
Alestle staff needs to have its
collective
aw areness
heightened on “these issues”
(of sexism). If the writers of
this letter w ere privy to some
o f the conversations th at
went on in this office under
the last editor-in-chief,
their blood would boil. They
would know that the attitudes
h ere are now very m uch
different.
That said, the writers make

Sensitivity training not needed

som e very valid points in
their letter. As a feminist and
a journalist, I have been
aware for several years of the
often-negative slant in which
wom en are portrayed in the
m edia — from advertising to
television
and m ovies to
news stories.
(C onversely,

case of E thiopian Mimi

female genital m utilation in
this country go unreported, or
the struggle of B urm ese
political activist Aung San

A perfect example of the
negative rep o rtin g w om en

hap p en ed just this past
summer. In mid-July, the St.

story of a teen m other who

75-year-old fornication law.
As I read the A P story

w ondered w hen the teen

letter to the editor

'Jo k e ' offensive, divorce is a serious issue
I was incredulous at the lack of feminist
and hum ane sensitivity displayed with the
Alestle Cam pus new spaper when printing the
“divorced Barbie who comes with all of K en’s
stu ff’ joke in a sum m er edition. That does
much to bolster the false image of wom en as
‘gougers’, ‘taking m en to the cleaners’ and,
otherwise, controlling and m anipulative in
money issues. In fact, m en who batter, rape
and verbally assault women, use that ‘control
over purse strings’ rationale to justify their
own behavior. Given the context of
relationships and societal oppression where
wom en are beaten, raped, verbally assaulted
and, otherwise, restricted from m oney making
or law making, I would venture to say that
w hatever pow er could be reeked from
‘buying’ at the grocery store is deserved, yes,
but not an accurate picture of the power
dynamics.
The stereotype belies the facts. In divorce
proceedings alone, m en’s incom e rises 42
percent and w om en’s incom e lowers nearly 60
percent. 11 is prim arily wom en who are single
heads of households supporting children.
Nearly 80 percent of child custody
arrangem ents end with wom en appointed as
the prim ary caregiver. This may due in part,
however, only to m en not asking for them
becaue in the divorce cases w here there is
docum ented violence, of the 20 percent of
men who do ask custody; 94 percent of them
get it. The exact proportions m ay vary
regionally but, nonetheless, are staggering.
The abandonm ent of children is not an

individual happening, it is a societal
phenom enon. A s a nation we are plagued with
m en (as a class) who don’t pay child support. I
specifically use the term men (as a class) to
speak sociologically. Not every man is a
batterer nor is every m an out there one who
will not pay child support. But, as a society, we
D O HAV E staggering rates of violence
against women and we D O HAV E an out of
proportion num ber of m en who do not pay
child support. This leaves our children as the
leading victims of poverty. To m ake m atters
worse, wom en going after child support, much
like wom en getting out of violent
relationships, find themselves running uphill
all the time, their own motives scrutinized
within a system that was not designed to and
will not protect them. O ur children suffer the
m ost, both in the short and long term.
So... m en’s income rises and they don’t pay
child support (as a class) but it is wom en who
are characterized as “taking it all.” I disagree.
However, pursuing this line of logic m akes *
perfect “backlash” sense because it focuses
the attention away from where it should be to
where it doesn’t need to be. We need to assess
the causes of this phenom enon. Could it be
that as a society we have so ‘masculinized’ our
m en to be hard, em otionally unavailable and
so geared towards success at work no m atter

S c o t t i s h band ‘ w e a v e s ’
r e f r e s h i n g blend o f m usic
By Marlin Thomas
For the Alestle
On Wednesday, Sept. 2 5 ,1 had
an experience that I never had
before. A group of four Scottish
gentleman,
the
Tannahill
Weavers, gave a concert here on
the SIUE campus that totally
blew my mind
T h e
Tannahill Weavers were part of
SIUE’s 1996-97 Arts & Issues
season. The group’s members—
Kenny Forsyth, Les Wilson, Roy
Gullane, Phil Smillie, and John
Martin—combined guitars, a
bagpipe, a fiddle, flutes and a
keyboard to make a melodic
blend
of
ballads
and
instrumentals that created highspirited music.
The Tannahill Weavers had a
down-to-earth charm and wit.
Before most of the songs, they

told a little humorous story about the
song’s meaning. The music brought to
mind folk music mixed with blues but
with a happiness and enthusiasm that
was inspiring. It contained style that
seemed traditional, yet, it was new and
fresh. It is no wonder that they are one
of Scotland’s premiere bands. This
concert was definitely worth seeing and
hearing.
I was not the only one who enjoyed
this sold-out performance. The
audience was deeply involved in the
concert. There was inspired applause
after every song (and clapping during
some songs). Laughter and music filled
the Communications Building Theater
that night as the audience was taken on
a musical journey that never slowed
down. The Tannahill Weavers were
rewarded with a standing ovation

hooked.

Press Release

Victorian New York’s fashionable W ashington Square is the setting of,
“The H eiress”, R uth and Augustus G oetz’ haunting tale of rom ance
among the rich, based on H enry Jam es’ novel Washington Square. This
Tony Award - winning play runs on the M ainstage of the R epertory
T heatre of St. Louis (The R ep) from Oct. 9 through Nov. 8.
A psychological h orror story set in the upper reaches of genteel New
York society in the 1850s, “The H eiress” is the story of Dr. Austin
Sloper, an o v erb earing successful physician and his only child,
C atherine, a shy, reclusive rath er plain young woman. Sloper’s wife died
in childbirth. As a result, C atherine has become a constant source of
resentm ent for him and equally a disappointm ent to him, as she
consistently fails to live up to the legacy of her brilliant and charming
m other. Unexpectedly, w hen C atherine acquires the only suitor ever to
show an interest in her, her unrelenting father threatens to disinherit his
daughter, m aking sure that the charm ing and handsom e fortune hunter
and the only m an that C atherine ever loved leaves her in the lurch.
“The H eiress” opened at New York’s Biltm ore Theatre on Sept. 29,
1947, with a cast that included E ngland’s Wendy H iller and Basil
Rathbone. The play ran for 410 perform ances through Sept. 18,1948, a
trem endously long run for that time.
Most recently, on M arch 9, 1995, “The H eiress” was revived at New
Y ork’s C ort Theater. It received four Tony Awards , including Best
Revival of a Play and was w inner of the O u ter Critics’ Circle Award for
Best Revival. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby
described the 1995 revival as “ ... literate, highly theatrical and
extrem ely satisfying” and com m ented, “The dialogue ... alternately

Cougars split
games over
the weekend
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
Friday night the SIU E m en’s soccer
team traveled to Quincy, 111. to take on
Quincy University.
O n the sam e night, the C ougars
w ent hom e h e a rtb ro k e n as they
dropped a 1-0 decision against their
GLVC rival.
“We haven’t scored a goal all year
on the road and that really hurts you,”
Sophom ore goalie A ndy K orbesm eyer
said, icing his leg dow n a fte r the
Southern Indiana gam e Saturday. “We
should’ve cam e out of Quincy with a
win.”
B ut the Cougars collected their
spirits quickly w hen they played
Southern Indiana.
Falling behind early, 1-0 in the first
half, the Cougars rallied with a goal
scored by senior R ob Thornberry in the
first half and junior D arren Snyder in
the second.
“We started off terrible and I really
d o n ’t know why. B ut we did som e real
good things to get those two goals, but
we just couldn’t get the third goal that
would have alm ost clinched the game,”
head coach E d H uneke said after the
game.
The Cougars missed several oppor­
tunities to get th at'th ird goal but it just
did not go in.
A penalty shot by senior Steve Van
Dyke hit off the post and bounced
back. Plus several offside penalties
stopped some C ougar break-aways.
B ut the Cougars did w hat they had
to do to com e out with a victory on
Saturday.
“The guys showed a lot of heart to
com e back from a tough loss against
Quincy,” K orbesm eyer said. “We came
,out and did w hat we had to.”

Point SIUE: Volleyball eases past Southern Indiana
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor

Todd Spann/Alestle

Cougars rolled by USI Saturday afternoon 15"4, 15-6, 15-9.

T here was an echo in the V adalabene
C enter Saturday afternoon as the words “point
S IU E ” was heard every time the Cougars put
up a score.
It was chanted num erous tim es as the
Cougars beat the University of Southern
Indiana in straight sets.
“We looked a lot sharper than yesterday,
and the key to us is ourselves. We have to play
with concentration and intensity,” head coach
Sandy M ontgom ery said after the game.
O ne of the bright spots of the afternoon was
the crowd.
W hether it was the fans dancing to the
M acarena during the set breaks, or yelling
“point S IU E ” after each score, the fact was
they were having a good time pum ping up this
S IU E volleyball team.

“We appreciate the fan support and it is
fun to com e back hom e and play in front of
great fans,” M ontgom ery said.
W ith the victory, the Cougars up their con­
ference m ark to 6-1 and are in the heat of a
conference battle.
O ne of the main reasons for the Cougars
success is the outstanding play of sophom ore
Michelle Gilman.
“M ichelle is a very consistent player and
people are starting to know about her and
blockers are starting to follow her around,”
M ontgom ery said.
Gilm an had her norm al perform ance
Saturday as she led the team with 18 kills.
Julie Litteken also finished the day with 11
kills.
The Cougars are now 13-7 overall and
travel to St. Louis to battle Missouri Baptist
Tuesday night at 7p.m. and then have until
Oct. 9 to prep are for Indianapolis.
