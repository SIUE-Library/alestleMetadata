ALTON. EAST ST. LOUIS & EDWARDSVILLE

University to meet several housing challenges
G r e e k

h o u s in g

re v a m p e d ,

By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
With a dram atic increase from incom ing
freshman, university administrators are beginning
the new school year with housing on their minds.
U niversity H ousing D irector M ichael Schultz
took the time to address where students living in
the R esidence Hall would go to study since five
study lounges were made into rooms.
“ The students will have the rem aining study
lounges and also the use o f the learning resource
center located on the first floor east wing. They can
also use the social lounges on each o f their wings,”
Schultz said.
Schultz believes the current situation with the
lounges as rooms will not last long.
“ We’re only looking at the situation with the
study lounges for a couple of w eeks, until we can get
those who don’t show up,” Schultz said.
B ecau se o f the lim ited sp ace, questions
concerning G reek housing w ere also answ ered,
including the reasoning behind a fraternity receiving
the faculty clubhouse to live in.
“ We already had Building 521 for freshmen. The

fr e s h m

e n

m

o v e

only G reek organization we had left on campus was
Alpha Phi A lpha Fraternity in (Building 524). So we
asked them if they would be willing to move into the
faculty club,” Schultz said.
The university’s future housing plans are being
reconsidered because of all the changes in rooming
arrangem ents.
Schultz said the university is currently conducting
a feasibility study on future housing. The study will
be com pleted in about two months. The university
was looking at the possibility of leasing off-campus
apartments. That option is still open for the future.
Incoming freshman received their housing
on a first-come, first-served basis.
Those with com pleted applications before June
15 received first choice. A fter that, students were
given four choices: room in one o f the former
Residence Hall study lounges, live at the freshmanonly apartments at Tower L ak e, remain at home or
cancel their housing contract.
“The increase of students was predicted and it’s
already been predicted it will be even tighter next
year,” Schultz said.

“ Honest efforts w ere made by the university to
anticipate the growth. First cam e the R esidence
H all. The goal now is to look at the additional
student growth on cam pus,” Em m anuel said.
H e also said one hindrance has been the
university’s efforts in looking for the most costefficient way to create more housing.
Som e may think that a mix-up came between
recruitment of students and the promise of available
housing.
“ There was no mix-up, according to enrollment.
The problem has come in the retention of students,”
Em m anuel said,“ R ight now we (university) has
contracted with a consultant agency to look at the
different options we might seriously consider.”
Em m anuel concluded that the university could not
give any date for a new residence hall, apartm ent
com plexes or leasing off-campus.
“ R ight now, all our options are open. It is
prem ature to assume how long any new housing
project will take until you decide what option is
best,’’Em m anuel said.

Police near completion of investigation of serial molester
Police are almost finished with their investigation of accused
serial molester Danny R. Schwab. Schwab, 29, of Belleville, has
been charged with sexually abusing three boys, ages 9, 12 and
16.
Sgt. Mike Boyne, chief of detectives for the Belleville Police
Department, said Friday that authorities had fielded between
150 and 200 calls about Schwab since they began their
investigation. He would not say how many alleged victims have
been turned up during the inquiry, but he made it clear they are
not limited to the three for whom Schwab has already been
charged.

Nancy Belck
Chancellor
Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville
Fall sem ester is and exciting and exhilarating time for both new
and returning students, faculty and staff. The division o f Student
A ffairs welcom es you to our dynamic U niversity and extends our
best wishes for your success in attaining your educational goals. I
encourage you to take advantage of the many opportunities
available to enhance your leadership potential and developm ent of
new skills.
You are important to us! I invite you to attend activities during
W elcome W eek to learn more about your University and become
acquainted with fellow students, faculty and staff. The division of
Student A ffairs is com mitted to providing quality service and
educational opportunities. If I can assist you in any manner, please stop by my office in the
Rendlem an Building, room 2306 or call for assistance at 692-2020.
Narbeth Emmanuel
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
H ey! My name is Christopher Nance and I serve as Student
Body President for the 96-97 academ ic school year. I would like
to take this opportunity to welcom e our returning students as
well as those o f you who are new to our community.
L ike you. Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville is
prim arily a young university and like you, it holds hope for our
future. With a vision consisting of integrity, inclusiveness and
cohesiveness, S IU E has the potential to becom e a G R E A T
university. T hat’s where you, the student, play a fundamental role.
M ake no m istake about it, students are the reason this university
exists. Consequently, we must ensure it lives up to its vision,
mission, goals, objectives, policies and procedures. This will
ensure that we are moving in the right direction and that we get there all together.
Student Governm ent (SG ) exists for this reason. I could not begin to stress the
importance of involvement on campus, but I’ll try. A university community is said to be a
microcosm of the “ real world” . With that in mind, few times will life afford you the
opportunity to practice before you play. This is truly the beginning o f the rest o f your life;
live it, play it, drink it and above all, G et Involved!
Christopher Nance
Student Body President

G reetin gs and w elcom e to Southern Illinois U niversity at
Edwardsville. I hope you find the University facilities and grounds
pleasant and com fortable. We strive diligently to ensure that the
campus environment is clean, com fortable and conducive to learning.
We intend to provide tim ely and efficient services for you and you
will find a number of changed services, including an expanded, more
service oriented police departm ent, including bicycle patrols and
expanded bus service to local shopping and M etro Link.
Your time at S IU E will be more meaningful if you engage yourself
in the programs o f the University, I encourage you to set high
standards for yourself. B est wishes to you for a successful and enjoyable year.
Ken Neher
Vice Chancellor for Administration

Som e time ago we sought contact with
a person who had been a part o f a
particular departm ent at the University
18 or so years before. A s part o f the
search we called the departm ent.
“ I'm sorry,” said the young woman
who answered the phone. “ I don’t think
he worked here. I’ve been here a year
and I don't recognize the name.”
We asked her to search for us briefly
beyond her own exp erien ce. She
conducted a short inquiry o ff the phone and returned to us.
“ No, I’m sorry. The secretary for this departm ent has worked
here for nine years and she says she doesn’t recognize the name
either.”
U ltimately, it fell to the chair o f the departm ent to put us in
touch with the person we sought. The young wom an had
provided a prime exam ple o f a notion apparently common on
university campuses today, unwitting though it m ay be: nothing

was here before I got here and nothing will be here when I ’m gone.
Such is decidedly not the case.
D ecades ago, decisions w ere being made and actions taken in
the classrooms, shops and offices on the S IU E campus that are
still affecting, in w hatever small m easure, what happens to you
today.
Just so, what you do during your career here will have an
affect on S IU E students who com e after you.
B e aw are that these hours, days, sem esters and years form a
continuum of which you are a vital part. Work hard while you are
here and enjoy yourself mentally, physically and spiritually, so
that what you pass on from your slice of time and experience
here will be a credit to those who have preceded you and
cherished by those who will follow you.
Our best wishes to you during your S IU E career and beyond.
Ted Sanders
President
Southern Illinois University
I would like to take this opportunity to welcom e you to
Southern Illinois U niversity at Edwardsville. Som e o f you are
new to the University and others are old friends. A s everyone
returns, the campus will becom e a buzz o f activity. Each
academ ic term is m et with a sen se o f excitem en t and
anticipation. The fall of 1996 is certainly not an exception.
Southern Illinois U niversity at Edw ardsville offers everyone a
wide variety o f opportunities to becom e involved with their
University Community. I would encourage everyone to actively
participate in making the University a better place to work and
learn. G etting involved not only m akes a difference to those
returning today, but also to those returning today, but also to
those who will arrive for the first time in the future.
I wish everyone the very best in the forthcoming year.
Sean Pohl
Board of Trustees
Southern Illinois University

It is my pleasure to welcom e new
and returning students. I urge you to
take advantage of the opportunities
offered at S IU E by drawing upon the
wisdom o f faculty, staff and other
students. I also urge you to enrich our
University community through your
participation in classroom and cocurricular activities.
Welcome Week is a very busy and
exciting tim e. It is a tim e to
experience the jo y and satisfaction o f learning. It is also a time
for renewing friendships and becoming acquainted with a
variety o f interesting people.
H ave a good year!

Hobson leading the way with
student mentoring program

University Park receives
U.S. funds for ethanol site
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor

A s a student senator, Randy Hobson was always hearing about the
student retention problem . A common solution to the problem was
discussing funding to im prove retention two or three years down the road.
“ It alw ays made me want to jum p up and get people to do something
now,” H obson said.
H obson did just that by starting one o f S IU E ’s newest student
organizations: the Student M entor A ssociation. H obson said S IU E loses
about 30 percent of its freshm en betw een the first and second years.
“ O ur goal is to reduce that by 10 percent each year for the first three
years,” he said. H e plans to do that by random ly matching a new student
with one who has been on campus at least one year. “There will be no
selecting. W hen a student signs up to be a mentor, I’ll just pull out the
first card in the freshm en pile. It won’t be black with black or women with
women. It’ll be random .”
H e sees this as a way to break down barriers and increase the diversity
the university is trying to achieve.
The interest in a m entoring program seem s strong. On the first day of
W elcome W eek, H obson had already signed up 30 new mentors in just a
couple of hours; 75 first year undergraduates had signed up. He wants to
see betw een 500 and 600 returning students signed up by the end o f the
w eek. Ideally, h e’d like to have 1,200 freshm en signed up for this year.
In the past, H obson has noted that “ empirical data has shown that peer
mentoring by upperclassm en for freshm en increases the number of
freshm en returning for the second year.”
“ This is probably the largest student organization recognized by the
Kimm el Leadership Center. The advantage is that mentors get leadership
experience; freshm en get another resource,” he said.
Much o f the business will be conducted via e-m ail, Hobson said,
although a quarterly new sletter is also in the works because “ I realize
there are people who don’t like e-m ail.”
B rian G ororo is president o f the group; Hobson is chair. For more
inform ation, call Kim m el Leadership Center at 2686.

S I U E ’s U niversity P ark will be
receiving funds from the fed eral
governm ent for a laboratory site to test
ethanol.
The project is part o f a new
agriculture spending bill that is setting
up a plant on campus.The governm ent
has already allocated $500,000 for it at
University Park.
U niversity Park’s Executive D irector
Brian D onnelly is pleased to see the
project finally underway.
“The university has been trying to get
this project for at least two years,”
D onnelly said. “ The initiative for it
cam e from
Congressm an
(D ick)
D urbin’s office. H e suggested University
Park for the project.”
Included in a $53.3 billion bill for
agriculture and food program s w ere
funding for building projects at D ePaul
U niversity in Chicago and Northwestern
U niversity in Evanston, 111.
T he $500,000 w ould be prim arily
designated money. R ight now the
funding has passed both houses of
C ongress and the bill is aw aiting
signature by President Clinton.
Though the project is not set to go
yet, D onnelly is hopeful.
“This thing is not a done deal.

A ccording to D onn elly fears c

Did you know that at one time SIUE had a real cougar as its mascot? Well it's true. Here Kyna
is enjoying one of the daily walks she took on campus. All cougars have been "commercial"
since the university's decision in 1986 not to keep the real cougars.

On August 7, 1996 at 4:46 p.m., police
investigated a traffic accident at Bluff Road and
Whiteside Drive. Lydia Jackson, 38, of Belleville,
turned south onto Bluff Road from Whiteside
Drive and hit a car driven by Kathleen Taylor, 48,
of Worden who was traveling north on Bluff Road.
Jackson was issued a state citation for failure to
yield at an intersection and for operation of
uninsured motor vehicle.

The Student Environm ental Action Coalition (SE A C , pronounced “ seek ” ) began in 1988
when students at the University o f North Carolina at Chapel Hill put an advertisem ent in
Greenpeace m agazine asking for students interested in forming a student environmental
network to respond. From there it has becom e the largest student-led environmental
organization in the country and has groups on over 2,000 campuses nationwide. SE A C has
tackled issues nationally such as accountability from corporations like British Petroleum,
Mitsubishi, Pepsi, Shell Oil Company and L evi’s Jeans. S E A C has also launched national
campaigns against N A FTA and other legislative bulldozers against environmental protection.
A t S IU E , S E A C has been involved nationally as well as locally. SE A C is an active student
organization on campus. M em bers o f the organization have been involved in recent projects
such as recycling, environm ental education programs, Earth D ay celebrations on campus and
in the community, benefit concerts, petitions to change university buying practices, clean-up
hikes and camp-outs.
To celebrate the autumnal equinox, S IU E S E A C is hosting a Bioregional G athering Sept.
20-22. Workshops, speakers, and circles for sharing information will help connect different
groups and provide education about regional issues. SE A C mem bers will travel from Missouri,
Illinois, A rkansas and K entucky to join in the celebration.
A community potluck is planned for Sept. 26 at 6 p.m. in the R eligious Center.
R epresentatives o f local environm entally friendly groups such as W atershed Nature Center,
Madison Country Conservation A lliance and Treehouse W ildlife Rehabilitation Center will
speak about their organizations.
S E A C strongly supports involvement on and o ff campus and encourages mem bers to think
globally and act locally. On campus one o f S E A C ’s most important functions is to serve as a
connecting force between students on campus and within the community while working for a
simpler, friendlier world. S E A C m eets every Thursday in the Religious Center at 4 p.m. For

Press R elease

The nation’s capitol m ay never be the sam e after Secret Service A gent Sam
Simms (Sinbad) is given the dubious honor o f being assigned to guard the
President o f the U nited States’ son, Luke (Brock Pierce). An undisciplined lad
with a penchant for m aking scandalous news headlines that em barrass the White

to the First Fam ily’s

“ The story o f ‘First
K id’ is about the pow er of
liking som eone for who
they are and not just what
they ap p ear to be,” says
director D avid M ickey
E vans. “ The screen play
involves the stories o f both

screenwriter and executive producer Tim K elleher. H e recalls how a newspaper
clipping sparked his imagination in creating the story line, explaining, “About
two days after the inauguration of President Clinton I saw a photograph of his
daughter C helsea in “ U S A Today.” She was surrounded by Secret Service Agents
and the caption exp lain ed that she w as picking out her code name.
Rem em bering what it was like when I was 14 and all o f the things that I was able
to do because there w eren’t any guards or parents constantly with me, I
wondered what it must be like for her to go through four of the most tumultuous
years in her life with a Secret Service A gent alw ays watching.”
“ I liked Tim K elleh er’s script because it had the elem ents o f comedy and
dram a and action all mixed together,” Sinbad says.
Timothy B usfield (“ thirtysom ething” and “ Field o f D ream s” ) stars as Agent
Woods, who, as the story begins, is definitely not enjoying great rapport with his
protectee, Luke. “ Woods is a veteran of the Secret Service and he is just about at
the end o f his rope for a multitude o f reasons that I think he’d like to blame all
on Luke,” says Busfield. “ H e’s angry and upset at the world and basically in the
wrong position and that’s what eventually gets him fired.”
R obert Guillaum e (“ B enson” and “ D eath W arrant” ) stars as A gent Wilkes,
Sim ms’ and Woods’ superior. W ilkes has his hands full in keeping Simms, let
alone the rest o f the agents, in line and consistently precision perfect.
The most straightly-laced m em ber of the Secret Service hierarchy is Morton,
portrayed by A rt L aFleu r (“ Man o f the H ouse” ). Jam es Naughton (“The Paper
C hase” ) stars as President D avenport, and Lisa Eichhom (“The Vanishing” )
stars as First Lady Linda Davenport.
“First K id” is rated PG and is due to be released in theaters soon.

A student vacationer rejoices: Despite new semester
stresses, it’s good to be back
By Melissa Mills
Lifestyle Editor
W elcome back everyone! Y eah, it’s that time of
the year again. B ack to school. B ack to the books.
B ack to those late night hours spent cramming for
that test or writing that paper. B ack to w hatever it is
you do during the fall sem ester.
The first w eek of a new sem ester is alw ays the
worst. It’s so hard to get back into the routine of
things. Study. Sleep. E at. G o to class. Work. Try to
have a life. M aybe sleep a little more.
B ut the routine thing is even harder to get back
into when you’ve just com e back from vacation.
Vacation. It alw ays sounds so fun and relaxing,
doesn’t it? B ut by the time you get back to the real
world, you need a vacation just to recover from
vacation. A t least I do. And after this summ er’s
vacation, I’m debating with m yself as to whether or
not I should ever go on another vacation again.
The big ‘V ’ this year was a 12-da.y stint in smoggybut-still-sunny southern California. 1 was so excited
before I left that I could hardly stand it. So I’m
saying to m yself: “ Self, you can go visit your old

friends that you haven’t seen for three years and just
have a great time. You w on’t have to worry about
anything. It’ll be the best vacation ever.”
Now I’ve been back for four days and I ’ve
decided to quit talking to myself. Actually, it’s more
like I’ve decided to stop listening to myself. A t least
for now.
Now don’t misunderstand me. It was great seeing
old friends and making new memories. But things
just aren’t like they were three years ago in the old
hometown in southern California.
Well, the smog is a given. I didn’t really plan on
breathing any clean air for about 12 days anyway.
But what am azed me was how much everyone had
changed. I know, I know. E veryo n e grow s up
eventually. But so soon?
More than half of my friends have children now.
Lots o f children. And with me being childless, I just
can’t convince my friends anymore that w e can just
“ get up and go.”
No, no, there’ll be no more of that getting up and
going for my fertile friends. A fter all, there are
diapers t’o change, potty trips to make, runny noses to
suction, swings to push and bottles to make. Then
there’s that sneaking-out-of-the-door-before-being-

seen-and-m aking-the-baby-cry trick that I’m ever so
fond of. I have never been so happy as when it finally
worked. Oh, I take that back. I think I was happier
when all the kids were asleep.
Now don’t get me wrong. I’m not putting anyone
down for having children. It’s just that I don’t have
any and so my priorities are a little different from
those who do. I know life is com pletely different
when there are children involved. I’m just not ready
for that life and I can’t relate anymore to my friends
who are.
N eedless to say, after countless diaper dilemmas
and potty tragedies, I’m finally back and glad to be
here. Yeah, so I miss Cali and my friends. But I’ll
never miss slobbering, screaming, pacifiers, portable
potties and diapers, diapers, diapers.
So back to my point. This first w eek will definitely
be the worst for those o f you trying to get back into
the daily grind. B elieve me, I can sympathize. But
hang in there, the Labor D ay holiday is just around
the corner.
And for those of you with children, hats o ff to
you. I sure could never do it. Vacation or no
vacation.

It’s about time for the Cardinals to
take control of the central division.
But first, they have to fend off a very
balanced Houston A stros team.
They can do this if they get by their
most important road trip o f the year.
First, they have to travel to Colorado
where no lead is safe and battle the
Rockies. The Cardinals have yet to gain a
victory in D enver this year.
Then, the Redbirds travel to Houston
for a four gam e w eekend series starting
Friday and ending Monday.
But lets take one step at a time. The
Cardinals first have to find a w ay to bring
there offense with them to Colorado who
is 5-1 against St. Louis. They will also have
to battle huge crowds in both stadiums.
Even Houston is reporting near sell-out
crowds.
For the w eekend series with Houston
M anager Tony Larussa has reorganized
his starting pitching so he can get his best

pitchers on the mound for the four
games.
Donavon O sborne, Todd Stottlem yre,
A lan B en es and A ndy B en es will be the
starting pitchers for the Redbirds.
The Cardinals have had some luck
with H ouston this year. They are 6-0
against the Astros this year including a 30 mark at the Astrodom e.
B y the end o f the w eek the Cardinals
could be setting the tone o f the pennant
race.
Cardinal notes:
R ay Lankford, who missed his fourth
game in a row Sunday with a groin pull
should be ready for T uesday’s gam e
against the Rookies.
Brian Jordan has been playing Center
field with John M abry playing right field.
The infield also took a different look
with G ary G eatti playing first, M ike
G allego at third and Luis A licea at sec­
ond.
The m oves were made because o f the
absence of Lankford but the hot bat of
Luis A licea also helped in the decision
making.
