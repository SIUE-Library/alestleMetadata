SG funds were
never frozen
by Rosie Githinji

Alestle Opinion Editor
There has been no freezing
of
funds
in
Student
Government according to
student
body
president
Brandon Rahn.
“They are not frozen,”
Rahn said. “They have never
been frozen.”
.
During a university town
hall meeting, held Nov. 18,
Chancellor Vaughn Vandegrift
said student fees were frozen
and that it was something
voted
on
by
Student
Government.
Rahn said he made the
executive decision to slow down
spending, not freeze it, in
Student Government. The
Senate approved the decision
through a resolution at the Nov.
20 meeting, according to Rahn.
“It is ultimately up to
Finance Board and the senate
as to what is approved and
what is not,” Rahn said.
“Mostly everyone that we have
met with and worked with
understands
the
current
situation.”
Rahn said money will be
more forthcoming once the
state makes the payments owed
to the university'.
The university' cannot use
the money in the Student
Government accounts but can
borrow against it and use it for
collateral.
Financial
Officer
Jeff
Harrison said students who
apply for program and travel
money should make sure they
are prepared to answer all
questions as to why they need
it.
“We’re looking really hard
at them,” Harrison said.
There is a student sub-fee,
which pays for all program and
travel requests, according to
Harrison. That fee is taken
from the student activity' fee
paid by students each semester.
“They pay the money, so
they deserve it,” Harrison said.
“We are not supposed to be
stingy'. We do ask them where
they get their other money
though.”
Harrison also said Finance
Board will hear all travel and
program
requests,
but
organizations
should
not
expect the money to be given
to them as easily as before.
“Most students don’t really'
understand the situation with
the budget,” Harrison said.

The art of a $6 million plan
Art & Design Building expansion completion depends on payroll
by Kari Williams

Alestle Reporter
The Art 8c Design Building will start
construction on a new wing by spring 2 0 1 0 ,
according to College o f Arts and Sciences
Dean Aldemaro Rom ero — that is if the
university is able to fix it’s budget problem.
The addition will cost approximately $6
million, according to Romero. The money is
from allocated funds given to the university
for im provement;
R om ero
said the
expansion will be put on hold due to the state
owing the university $ 1 6 .5 m illion to meet
the Jan. 1 payroll.
“R ig h t now the priority is for the
university system is to make sure we have
enough money' to cover all the employees’
salaries for campus, so that means that
money for all other purposes is being held
until that cash flow issue is resolved,”
Rom ero said.
Chair o f the D epartm ent o f Art 8c
Design John D enH outer said he is
disappointed about the addition being put on
hold but understands the universities
priorities.
“The faculty and [paying their] salaries
has to be the top priority. I think everyone
understands that and we ju st have to make

said though the expansion is being put on

“I ’m unsurprised because o f the dire
strains o f the state budget,” Dim ick said.
Freshman studio art m ajor N icole Fry

important issue.

Flagging plagiarism
SafeAssign helps faculty stop cheating
by Lindsey Oyler

Alestle Photographer

Hunter Creel/Alestle

Students had the chance to receive a free massage in the Goshen
Lounge Wednesday to help alleviate The stress before finals
week.

Blackboard
now
offers
SafeAssign, a new plagiarism
detection program available to
S IU E professors to better spot
plagiarism in assignments.
Jennifer Vandever, associate
vice chancellor for Inform ation
Technology', sent an e-mail to
faculty members, describing the
purpose o f the new program:
“SafeAssign
serves as
a
plagiarism checker by flagging
text identified as closely' matching
other Internet, article, or student
resources; displaying possible
sources where that text is located;
and indicating the percentage o f
a paper that is attributable to
other sources.”
SafeAssign is available to all
S IU E faculty, students and
professors using Blackboard as o f
Nov. 2 0. However, SafeAssign
has to be added by the professors
for
any
already
existing
Blackboard pages.
Among users o f the new
program is English Departm ent
Chair Larry LaFond said he was

concerned
with
academic
dishonesty.
“I t ’s technically a type o f
academic dishonesty to pass
along someone’s work o ff as your
own,” LaFond said.
Students’ work
may
be
investigated any'time a professor
feels it is necessary, according to
LaFond. Finding problems when
double-checking the validity o f
work happens more often than
LaFond would like.
“W hen a reader can’t tell if it’s
your words, there’s a problem ,”
LaFond said. “It happens every
semester, and students think
they’re not going to get caught.
It’s not uncom m on, but it’s not
something everyone does.”
Vandever said
this
new
plagiarism checker will eliminate
the issue.
“This tool will ideally reduce
overt and accidental plagiarism
by helping students understand
quotation
attribution
and
citations,” Vandever said in the email.

require high temperature and electricity.
That also needs to be reform [ed] in order to
keep up with the standards that are required
by both federal and the state law.”
Rom ero said the expansion will allow
for more classrooms and faculty offices to
keep the whole department in one building.
“ [An added wing will] also [create]
bigger spaces for the workshops, especially
metal w orking and ceramics, and also ...
improve the space for some o f the other
activities,” Rom ero said. “For example, art
history [has] offices in buildings other than
the Art & Design Building, so we want to
put all the department faculty together in
the same building.”
D enH outer said the department is split
between the Art and Design Building, which
contains the studios, and Alumni Hall,
which holds the art history, art therapy and
art education programs.
“After they bring the other departments
over to this building, then there would be
some retrofitting o f the existing building,
which would improve some o f the studio

notice, it’s going to stay like this
through the spring semester.”
Senator Joel Durham serves
on the finance board. He said
the senators understand the
budget issues and are doing their
best to limit spending.
“We had a resolution on the
floor at the last meeting,”
Durham said. “It was passed as
written with no additions and
no addendums.”
The resolution essentially
says that Student Government is
going to slow spending down,
and they understand what is
going on with the budget.
There is a spending freeze in
other departments such as
Housing and die College o f Arts
and Sciences, and there is also a
hiring freeze for staff. Faculty' is
still being hired.
Academic necessities and
programs that will benefit the
campus will get money from the
Senate, according to Durham.
All annual allocations have
been
minimized
to
only
necessary office materials, but all
single semester allocations will
not be available until further
notice, according to Durham.
“Freezing means you can’t
spend any money' slowing
spending means money is
limited,” Durham said. “Student
Government spending is not
frozen.”

and the office situation that we currently
have,” D enH outer said. “There are some
open spot areas in the building here, like
[the] atrium ... R ight now that’s really sort
o f an underutilized space. We need to wall
that in and somehow create a more usable
space for that.”
D enH outer said the atrium is used for
lecturers, but its location at the front o f the
building presents a problem.
“We have a number o f visiting artists
that come in from across the country, and
there’s no space in this building where they
can really talk in an easy way. [In the
atrium ], there [are] sounds. There [are]
doors slamming and opening [and] drafts
that come in. The lighting is bad, so a new
auditorium would really allow our visiting
artists to present in a professional manner,
professional space,” DenH outer said.
Art & design professor Jane Barrow said
she looks forward to the expansion and its
ability to create space and allow better areas
for guest lecturers.
“I hear about [expansions] happening

with other colleagues o f mine at other major
universities, and I assumed that would never
[happen] here at my university,” Barrow
said. “As someone who’s taught here for 13
years, the idea o f an expansion ... is
incredibly re-energizing for me as a faculty
member.”
Fry said the addition to the Art &
Design Building will aid in both working
and seeking out help.
“I am beyond excited. Finally, we have
more room to work. It’s really crowded in
there right now. There’s barely enough space
for the classrooms,” Fry said.
According to Fry, the current classrooms
have so little space that students “basically
have to tip toe around people’s set ups.”
Dim ick said the addition will bring
faculty together and enhance the program.
“Faculty from every area o f offices [will
create a] centralized dialogue...[and] create
a holistic vision,” Dimick said.

According to LaFond, the
issue may be helped by
SafeAssign,
but
personal
methods on a teacher-to-student
basis work just as well.
“Professors can help prevent
it with different kind o f
assignments and knowing their
own students’ w riting,” LaFond
said.
N o matter the method o f
finding plagiarism, students will
hurt their own record or grades
regardless due to consistent
penalties.

“I t ’s the most serious offense
[a
student]
can
com m it
academically,” LaFond said.
“They will be failed on the
assignment at a minimum. All o f
the cases are reported to the
administration.”
According to LaFond, repeat
offenders should be aware that
their status at the university will
be in peril.
Freshman
pre-pharmacy
m ajor Curtis H oalt o f O blong
said the risk isn’t worth
expulsion.

“Plagiarism is dumb,” Hoalt
said. “It takes no skill to do
whatsoever. It’s a bad idea
because if you get caught, you
get kicked out.”
Even though H oalt dislikes
the idea o f plagiarizing, he said
he is against the reliability o f a
computer
for
checking
assignments.
“It’s not even ethical to check
our work with a computer,”
H oalt said. “I t ’ll probably end
up being really close to someone
else’s work no matter what.”

LaFond said the SafeAssign
tool may not be “terribly
necessary.”
“There’s nothing wrong with
out policy and tools already,”
LaFond said. “It isn’t very
ambiguous.
[Plagiarism]
is
dishonest, and it’s subject to
censure. That’s it.”

Corporations exploit meanings of holidays
Music, television and every' medium in
between give Christmas its commercialized
appeal that lures non-Christians into the
holiday bustle.
Nearly every store under the sun has
extravagant,
holiday
blowout sales that entice
the thriftiest shoppers to
brave the weather and
crazy shoppers to get that
one big bargain. We call
that Black Friday.
Everyone wants to
snag the last Nintendo Wii
or whatever happens to be
Kari
the latest craze this year.
Williams
But when you get down to
it, none o f that matters.
Christmas has become
less about Jesus Christ and its roots in the
Christian faith and more about the best deals
at the local mall or retail store. Maybe it is time
to whip out that old V H S tape o f Dr. Seuss’s
original “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” to
make Americans realize, at least in one way or
another, what this time o f year is really about.
It is not about playing “noisy games like

zoozit and kazay, a roller skate type o f lacrosse
and croquet,” it is about cherising and
spending time with your family.
Other holidays during this time such as
Hanukkah and Kwanzaa stress the importance
o f family togetherness just as much as
Christianity, yet some members o f all these
religions seem to cast away their faith for a
quick deal.
The pressure society puts on religion o f
any kind sends the message that faith should
take a back seat to blockbuster deals and door
busters.
I understand with the economic state o f
the country, companies will do anything
within the realm o f possibility to keep their
businesses in the black. But must they do so at
the expense o f a holiday that society already
represses enough?
Students cannot have Christmas parties
— they have holiday parties — and Christmas
break must be called winter break or semester
break so as not to offend non-Christians.
Cashiers and greeters in corporate stores say,
“Happy Holidays” rather than “Merry
Christmas.”
Such actions disgrace all who practice

Christian-based religions, taking away the
basic meaning o f Christmas.
Commercialization has spread like a
disease across America, forcing gift-giving and
superficial holiday decorations to take
precedence over the religious significance o f
the holiday.
For Christians, the story o f Jesus Christ’s
birth is the true meaning o f Christmas: to care
for others no matter our differences and to
keep religion close to our hearts. Americans
need to take a step back from their hectic lives
and realize that getting the best deals on gifts
is not the most important part o f any holiday.
Sure, everyone enjoys a good bargain, but the
holiday is not about bargains.
Christmas
is
about
celebrating
Christianity with the ones you cherish most —
regardless o f how many perfecdy wrapped
presents are waiting underneath that artificial
tree you bought on Black Friday for half off.

Commuter meal plan at SIUE should offer more
M any com m uters here at S IU E
complain about tire inability to purchase a
meal plan, and many on-campus students
have no idea how their meal plans work.
W hen spending up to $ 1 ,3 8 5 on your food
per semester, it’s
im portant
to
know where the
m oney goes. So
here is just a little

Letter
to the
Editor

explanation
on
the meals plans
here at S IU E .
W hen you buy the plan A or B (which
is mandatory for first year, on-campus
students) 6 0 percent o f the money given to
the school goes to the base cost o f running
the food services here on campus while you
are left with only 4 0 percent o f w hat you
paid the school on your meal card, the
school can do this by having students pay
for only 4 0 percent o f their meals.
In the end, when you buy $ 1 0 worth o f

food for $ 4 with plan A or B , you already
paid the other 6 0 percent at the beginning
o f the semester. Th e reason upperclassmen
don’t have to get the 60/40 plans is because
these students have the means to cook their
ow n food in the housing allotted to them,
and it is unfair to charge them for a service
that they don’t use nearly as m uch as the
students at the freshmen residence halls do.
A meal plan is a pretty convenient way
for students to pay for their food and is nice
because it doesn’t com e out o f their pockets.
N ow is it unfair that commuters don’t have
the same privilege o f having a meal plan?
O ddly enough, the current system
incorporates the com m uters into the
equation, and it makes a lot o f sense.
Com m uters have a similar program as the
Cougar meal plans. You pay an amount o f
your choice in $ 1 0 0 increments and get all
that money put on to your card. O n top o f
that, to encourage meal plans over out-ofpocket cash, you also get $ 1 0 back for every

$ 1 0 0 that you put in. T h e reason that 6 0
percent o f this m oney isn’t taken at the
beginning, like w ith plan A or B , is because
they don’t use the campus resources, which
the 6 0 percent covers, as m uch as those that
live on campus.
To sum it all up, the meal plan system
in place took a lot o f thought and care while
being created. I t is fair to on-campus
students and com m uters alike. Th e only
problem with the system in place is the lack
of
com m unication
between
the
adm inistration and the students. $tudents
hold a lot o f responsibility in n ot knowing
this inform ation. Th e inform ation is given
to us and isn’t hidden. I t ’s the lack o f
initiative from students that have invented
this nonexistent problem.

Probing the effectiveness of pick-up lines

Typically, the men do all the work. They initiate the first conversation, ask for the girl’s

conversation is meant to blossom into a relationship. Thus evolved the pick-up line,
that one-line opener designed to get the opposite sex’s attention and, in
some occasions, more than just their attention. From the cheesy to the
grotesque to the just plain weird, some bar goers have gone down in flames with their

equality at the bar, or does one sex still have to put in the extra effort? The Alestle
sent two reporters out into the bars and into the realm o f pick-up lines to find out.

“Are you from Tennessee ... ‘cause you’re the only 10 I see,” might not be the most
effective line, but it sure gets a lot o f laughs.
The cheesy lines were the most fun to use because o f the laughter, but also because
I’ve heard them more times than I can count.
M ost men were pretty cool about having a line used on them. But instead o f the line,
the result — laughter — seemed to be a good way to strike up a conversation. And there
was a lot o f laughter.
The first man I used the “Tennessee” line on looked at me to try and decide if I was
serious, but ended up laughing anyway. He then spent the rest o f the night disappearing
and reappearing to ask for more o f my cheesy lines, probably to use on other girls at the
bar.
My next unsuspecting victim heard: “H i, I just wanted to give you the satisfaction
o f turning me down. Go ahead, say no.” He looked like he didn’t want to refuse, but was
once again suspect o f my intentions. Laughter and a drink followed.
The cheesy lines brought about laughter and conversation, but the dirtier ones got
mixed reactions.
“Lay down, 1 think I love you.” That line got a response of, “Are you serious?” No,
I wasn’t. The reaction was all I was after.
It would seem that having a
line ready was not even necessary.
The fact that I was a woman,
available and ready to talk,
seemed to be enough for men.
I did hear a few lines while I
was out, and I would have to say
a personal favorite is, “Are you
married?” after which only
response after “no”didn’t seem to
matter. I heard that question
three times in one night. It’s kind
o f silly, since men should look at
the ring finger first before
attempting a line.
The second best line o f the
night was from a man who said
he would like to dip me in butter
because o f my great skin tone. It
seemed strange that a straight
guy would notice my skin tone
first, but maybe he was just really
drunk.
Another guy told me he
liked my tattoo, which was a
beautiful way to start a conversation (with me anyway), because it is obviously something
that interests me. The best lines are always when the guy notices a small detail about a
girl instead o f sticking to the cliches.
Overall, using lines on guys was funny for my girlfriends and also for me, but not
somediing that I felt I needed to do. I have to admit that using pick-up lines on men is
something that never occurred to me, but the experience made for an interesting night
and gives my friends and I something to laugh about in the future.
Even though I feel like I did not need any lines, by the end o f the night, one line
worked perfectly.
You know, I know a great place for breakfast.

Maybe the first thing I should have asked was “Are you married?”
M y game Saturday failed miserably.
I do not like being forward with pick-up lines. They are cheesy and stupid. They
make you look like a tool.
My approach was to make an observation about the woman, maybe give her a subde
compliment, make up a time-constraint and get out o f there. Sometimes, I would let my
wingman open and swoop in minutes later.
I started out die night at Big Daddy’s Soulard location. There is a great Big Daddy’s
in Edwardsville, but St. Louis was the destination.
My hat picked up more girls than I did. Before going to Wild Country Friday night,
I bought a $ 4 fedora at Kohl’s because, to my chagrin, they did not carry cowboy hats.
I was rocking the Jason Mraz look. I took the hat with me Saturday as well, and hoped
at the end o f the night, someone would be singing “I ’m yours,” and the pick-up lines I
laid out would get me ... well ... you get the idea.
I was on the patio and a woman told me I looked like Mraz. I did. She did the picking
up for me; I just had to bring it home. A few minutes into the conversation she blew it
by saying she was married ... at 24, so, I left.
We moved inside to the dance floor, and I couldn’t keep up with the women who
took my stupid hat. I took it as total
flirting, as any guy would. It opened
up a few conversations, but nothing
really culminated from any o f it.
From now on, I better get your
number if you take the hat.
So, Big Daddy’s failed, and it
was o ff to Morgan Street Brewery on
the landing.
I saw a woman sitting at the bar
and asked what she was drinking. She
asked me to buy her and the
bartender a shot. She was asking for
handouts like I was the government
and thought she could get away with
it just because she was hot.
I asked why she deserved a drink,
and why the bartender couldn’t just
make her own for free. This went on
for a few minutes, and I caved. It was
going nowhere, so I went upstairs
and told her that I would be around.
Upstairs, I told one woman I
had a life or death situation and
needed some female input.
The question? Is it gay for a guy to listen to the Backstreet Boys? It was more or less
an “opener,” but I prefer it to be something stupid like, “Hey, are you from Mercury,
because you are damn hot?” I used a few compliments like “that’s a nice shirt” or
something, they failed, and I moved on, again.
The hat continued to get more action than me. I decided to ask girls before dancing,
because it’s gentlemanly and all, but it didn’t help my game.
I ended the night with zero phone numbers, zero kisses and a sad face. I guess it’s
time to regroup and see if I can do better next weekend.
Pick-up lines suck. They are too obvious. Maybe the cliche factor is funny and actually
works, but I ’m not a fan. Wearing a cool hat helps, but it gets you nowhere if you can’t
effectively work a bar.

BFA artists display life achievements in media
Byrd said his choice o f digital media
properly conveyed his central theme o f
technology and life.
“It’s called ‘Conversation 2 .0 ,’” Byrd
said. “W ith the theme focusing on
technology they tie in together. It’s about
the disconnection o f people through
technology.”
Senior ceramics
major
Patricia
Rehkemper o f New Baden featured her
socially controversial ceramic pieces as a
means to show needed change in society.
“I do pieces with graffiti and the 1950s
housewife icon,” Rehkemper said. “It
represents changing the social chain, which
most o f my work is about.”
Rehkemper said the entire process o f
being accepted into the BFA exhibit and
program was a turning point as well as an
interesting time o f her ceramics career.
“I think all o f it is special,” Rehkemper
said. “It’s a rite o f passage, and it’s about
having work about my life and having such
a change in my life. It’s very interesting and
it somewhat [validates] my work.”
Powers said the overall exhibit’s
purpose and the artists featured in the
actual show make it different than the other
exhibits.
“The selectiveness o f the people
involved makes this exhibit unique,”
Powers said. “This exhibition shows a
collection o f people chosen to pursue
something they are passionate about and
showcase their talents as almost a round o f
applause.”

Selected seniors in the Bachelor o f Fine
Arts program have a different kind o f final
test to pass, the test o f community
approval.
On Friday, the reception for the
Bachelor o f Fine Arts Exhibition allowed
SIU E and the community to view the work
o f students in the New Wagner Gallery in
the Art & Design building, which
continues until Dec. 19. One o f those
seniors featured was graphic design student
Jackelynn Powers o f Troy.
“The BFA exhibition is equivalent to
finals or a senior project,” Powers said. “It
is the sum o f our semester’s work. We had
to develop a thesis and then develop a
group o f artwork that reflected it.”
Powers is one o f the five artists
participating in this exhibition. Students
must apply and be accepted into the BFA
exhibition before turning in pieces on Dec.
2. The current exhibition is the second BFA
exhibit this year. According to Powers,
those featured are those eligible to
complete their degree.
Powers’ piece portrayed her life’s
“stepping stones” through a graphic design
done in Adobe Illustrator.
“My series is titled ‘22 Things I ’ve
Learned While 2 2 ,’” Powers said. “I chose
to create this series on the stepping stones
o f this past year that have gotten me to
where I am now.”
Powers chose to do a graphic design
project using familiar concepts in order to

convey her life’s story, such as ideas from
her education and social life.
“I also felt that it was important to do
something I was familiar with and
comfortable with in order to create a
successful series,” Powers said. “Some o f
my lessons are humorous, but they all serve
an important purpose.”

Senior graphic design major Philip
Byrd said the amount o f time to complete
his project allowed it to be more personal.
“It was different because each o f us
was given an entire semester to dedicate to
this work,” Byrd said. “I got the chance to
choose something very personal and
something that people could still relate to.”

The young Cougar wrestling team had a rough time against quality
Division I competition Friday and Saturday at the Las Vegas/Cliff Keen
Invitational in Primm, Nev.
As a team, SIU E scored seven points at the invite, landing them
in 39th place out o f the 42 teams present.
SIU E wrestling Head Coach David Ray said he is not discouraged
by the results. He said he looks at each match and wants to continually
improve.
“We have to come back and look at our weaknesses, then make
them at least less vulnerable, or turn them into strengths...” Ray said.
“I know sooner or later it will click for those who keep a positive
attitude and oudook and don’t worry about the L ’s or the W ’s and just
worry about what they have to do to be the best they possibly can.”
The Cougars left Vegas bruised.
SIU E senior Eric Pretto was out with a sprained ankle, sophomore
Dillon Pousson had a dislocated shoulder, sophomore Terrence
Connors was benched with a sprained clavicle, and sophomore Steve
Ross injured his elbow in the first match o f the invitational.
“[I] just got into a weird position, and it popped out,” Ross said.
“It was kind o f a freak accident, but it happens.”
Ross said he will be out this weekend, and possibly next, but he
will be back when SIU E goes to the University o f Illinois on Jan. 8.
Ohio State University snagged the top spot with a score o f 122.5,
one point more than Cornell University.
Pousson said now that the team has filled all the weight positions,
a vast improvement from last season, the important thing to focus on
is staying injury-free, something the team has failed to do so far this
year.
“[One] main thing is staying healthy. We have kids getting serious
injuries,” Pousson said. “So we need everyone back in the [weight]
room so we can have people getting pushed by new people everyday.”
Ray said injuries do not help, but there are numerous other things
the team needs to work on in order to matchup with the D -I
competition they are facing this year.
‘W e’ve got some guys out, but what’s really happening is we’ve
scheduled a lot tougher teams this year, and we’re finding out who can

Intrasquad scrimmage. The team finished 39th out of 42 teams in
the Las Vegas/Cliff Keen Invitational Friday and Saturday.

handle the tougher schedule and the demanding competition.” Ray
said. “Some guys that are out, it may just be an indication that they
need to work harder and prepare better for the competition,”
Besides the obvious benefits o f staying healthy, Ross said the team
needs to step it up overall in the weight room.
‘W e really need to pick up the intensity in the room and having
everyone just battling it out, which is going to help make everyone
tougher come match time,” Ross said.
SIU E freshman Brendan Murphy and sophomore Blake Reed were
the only Cougars to get wins for SIU E . Murphy did so with a pin
against Angel Garcia o f the University' o f North Carolina-Greensboro,
and Reed won by an injury default.
Ray said he does not regret the tough D -I schedule the Cougars

Nine new high school recruits have signed National Letters o f

The most recent signees are additions to die Cougar women’s
basketball squad. Last week, SIU E women’s basketball Head Coach
Amanda Levens announced the signing o f three guards who all come
from winning programs at the high school level.
The three recruits who will join the Cougars next season include
A.J. Ledbetter (Rock Island), Jazmin Hill (O ’Fallon) and Valerie
Finnin (Mokena). Levens said she is looking for athletes who are
committed to building the program for the long haul.
“They are going to have a chance to come here and make an
impact immediately,” Levens said. “These athletes already understand
that you will never get something for nothing. We know what we
RECRUITS/pg. 10

The man who started the SIU E track program in 1969, Jack
Whitted, died Tuesday at the age o f 83.
Whitted lived in Chesterfield, Mo. and graduated from Danville
High School in 1944. H e began at SIU E as a health education
instructor in 1967, and was the head o f intramural sports at the East
St. Louis campus until taking over die track program. He entered the
SIU E Intercollegiate Athletics Hall o f Fame in 2 0 0 7 as winner o f the
Jean McDonald Distinguished Service Award, and SIU E teams went
63-20-1 under his direction.
The road to SIU E for Whitted started at die University o f Illinois,
and from there he went on to earn his bachelor’s degree at Eastern
Illinois University. He received a master’s degree in physical education
in 1961 at Washington University o f St. Louis. His coaching career
began at the Illinois State Training School for Boys in Hillsboro, and
he coached three sports at Rock Junior High School in East St. Louis.
He retired from the university in 1988.

Episcopal Church in St. Louis Friday and burial will be at Jefferson
Barracks National Cemetery.

face this season. He said he knows his team benefits from and values the experience, and he is confident that
the season-long competition will benefit them in the season-ending tournament. However, he also said the
team must step up and put some extra work in outside o f scheduled practice time if they are going to
compete.
“The guys have learned they have to pick it up and compete at a much higher intensity than we do
now...” Ray said. “I hope that at year’s end, all o f this high level o f competition is going to make them
perform very well at our conference tournament and the national tournament.”

need to do to be successful. This is the foundation for
the team that we hope we will be competing for the
Ohio Valley Conference championship.”
Ledbetter is a 5-7 guard who earned third team

play hard all the time. A good example o f that is right
across the river in Tony LaRussa. All he expects o f his
players is for them to play hard.”
Fresh o ff the 2009 season, SIU E volleyball Head
Coach Todd Gober has also landed some new recruits.
Next year the Cougars will add to their core o f young
players with Kelsey Augustine (Geneva) and Julia
Whitfield (Jefferson City', M o.).
“I feel we have a good idea to where we need to
train for returning athletes and what we will need for
the recruiting class coming in,” Gober said. “[What]
we really had to do was bring in a little bit more
athleticism and targeting volleyball skills. Both Kelsey
and Julia are very experienced, high level athletes.”
Both Augustine and Whitfield have the potential
o f becoming key players for his team. Gober said
Augustine is the dynamic type o f athlete he looks for
and has the attitude that will help her be successful in
life. According to Gober, Whitefleld is a third-team
All-American on a national level and has also gained
first team All-State honors.
“I am really excited about how this young group
fits in with our other group,” Gober said. “We are
trying intentionally to go young with the intention o f
looking toward the future.”

All-State honors two straight years at Alleman High
School. Hill is regarded as one o f the area’s top players
and is the point guard that Levens said she has wanted
since here time here at SIU E . Finnin will serve as a
combo guard for the Cougars.
“All o f them overall are great people and great
students, which is what we also look for in our
recruits,” Levens said. “We have had a lot o f bright
spots, but we have also had a lot o f learning as well.”
With 9 4 4 career wins and 32 years o f coaching at
SIU E under his belt, Cougars’ baseball skipper Cary
Collins has seen many great athletes come and go.
With the collaborative effort o f Assistant Head Coach
Tony Stoecklin, Collins has signed four athletes that
will join the SIU E roster in spring 2011.
The four student-athletes include pitcher Ryan
Daniels (St. Louis), middle infielder Chase Green
(Effingham), catcher Brian Sipe (Mt. Vernon) and
shortstop Mike Swinnen (Mt. Vernon).
“We had some good underclass guys that picked
up the load last season that are back this year, which
makes us think that we are going to be better this
year,” Collins said. “You always want your team to T.J. Cowell can be reached at tcowell@alestlelive.com or 650-3524.

What: SIUE men's basketball at Lipscomb
Where? Alien Arena, Nashville, Tenn.
When? Thursday, Dec. 10 7:00 CST

590 the fan, WSIE
What to (listen) for: This is a rematch of a Nov. 28 matchup at

the Vadalabene Center. The Bisons won 67-64. Lipscomb
outrebounded the Cougars 40-33, and Josh Slater scored all 16
of his points in the second half. Freshman forward Mark Yelovich
turned in the best game of his career for the Cougars, with 26
points and 13 rebounds. For SIUE to win, they have to continue
rebounding. In both of the Cougars wins at the Drake Hy-Vee
Classic, they outrebounded the competition. The second key of the
game is to shut down Lipscomb’s two biggest weapons in Slater
(19 ppg) and Adnan Hozdick (21.6 ppg.) They also have to get
Aamir McCleary going to support Yelovich, after the Bisons held
him to two points in the teams earlier matchup.
