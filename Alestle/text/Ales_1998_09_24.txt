SIUE looking toward future
Chancellor delivers “State o f the University”
address filled with optimissum fo r the campus
BY DANIELLE BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF

Jill Stevens/Afesi/e

Dave Dunbar,; worker from the general contractors who are
building the Engineering Building, matches the bricks for the
new building. The expansion o f the campus was one o f the
focuses o f the chancellor’s address to the university.

SIUE C hancellor David
Werner’s “State of the University
Address” Wednesday focused on
the
many
increases
and
accom plishm ents
at
the
university as well as SIUE’s
future.
Enrollment has made strides
with the increased number of
students living on campus and a
record class of new freshmen.
Werner said that enrollment is on
an upward trend with a 12
percent increase over last year.
He gave credit to the
recruitment staff and the new
developments in housing for the
increases
in
enrollment.
According to Werner, there are
now 2,288 students living on
campus. Werner said there is now
“rem arkable balance between
residential
and
com m uter
students.
“Full-time students are up 7
percent,” Werner said. “Students
are focusing more on school and

less on other pursuits.”
Werner said that although
the numbers in each freshman
class
have
been
steadily
increasing, there is still room for
transfer students.
“Transfer students are and
will continue to be a very
important part of our student
body,” Werner said.
Werner said that SIU E’s
revenue increase coincides with
the strong Illinois and U.S.
economies.
State appropriations make
up 45.7 percent of the budget,
totaling $60.6 million. Tuition,
student fees and housing income
total $44.9 million and make up
33.9 percent of the budget. Also,
SIUE received funds for salaries,
for the library, off-campus
nursing facilities and other
activities on campus.
The healthy budget will
allow the continuation of the
growth and development plans
for this campus, Werner said.

Freshman numbers up; black enrollment down
Boom continues fo r fifth straight yea r
BY TAMARA KANO
NEWS STRINGER
Over the past five years,
Southern Illinois University
Edwardsville has reported a
continuous overall increase in
academic enrollment. The figures
are collected every year after the
second week of classes.
One of the categories in
which enrollm ent has grown
significantly since 1994 was in
total headcount. In 1994 SIUE
had 10,945 students, compared to
this year’s total of 11,520. Some
other areas that presented a
meaningful increase are students
enrolled full-time, the size of the
incoming freshman class, and the
number of new
freshmen
enrolled. An increase o f 514
students resulted in a full-time

enrollment figures of 7,848 — a
7 percent rise over last year. The
number of freshmen at SIUE has
grown from 1,911 for the 19941995 academic year to 2,059 for
the 1998-1999 academic year,
and the number of new freshmen
went from 1,019 to 1,415 during
the same period.
According to Provost David
Sill, SIUE has been working very
hard to improve the quality of its
programs.
“We have been hiring new
teachers, specifically for general
education
courses,
which
freshmen sign up for,” Sill said.
Sill believes that another
reason for the increase of
incoming freshmen is the
completion of Prairie Hall, the
university’s second residence
hall.

D ecline in black numbers is a m ystery
BY SETH TREPTOW
NEWS STRINGER
The num ber of black
undergraduate students enrolled
at SIUE has decreased from
1,408 in 1993 to 1,088 in 1997,
and nobody really knows why.
To add to the mystery, the
number and percentage of black
students receiving degrees has
increased and for the fifth
consecutive
year
overall
undergraduate enrollm ent has
increased from 8,610 to 8,707
between 1996 and 1997.
Liz Tarpey, assistant to the
provost and author o f SIU’s 1998
Annual Report on Minorities,
Women, and Disabled Students,
Faculty, and Staff Participation,
said that the number of black

first-time freshmen has remained
approximately the same over the
last five years at approximately
200.
In 1993, blacks represented
16 percent of the undergraduate
student body. In 1997, that
num ber had dropped to 12
percent. Possible explanations
for this four point drop include
increased graduation rates, firsttime freshm en and transfer
student enrollment, financial aid
resources and population density.
“We looked at whether or
not there has been a shift in the
population density within our
region, but there hasn’t been, so
that’s been maintained at a fairly
stable rate over the last five
years,” Tarpey said.

EDITOR IN CHIEF
Reactions were favorable to
SIUE Chancellor David Werner’s
“State of the University” address
Wednesday.
More than 300 people
attended the speech. And,
members of the audience said
W erner’s address was well
prepared and well organized.
The speech, which gave an
overall sense of well-being about
the university, caused members
of the audience to smile and
applaud often.
“Overall, this cam pus is
strong,” said Special Service
Academic
A dvisor
Danita
Mumphard. “I like the way its
growing.”
M umphard said she was
im pressed by the way the
university has come up with new
ideas to help accommodate the
growth.
Lela M. DeToye and Dianne
Koehnecke of the SIUE School
of Education also had favorable
things to
say
about the
chancellor’s speech.
“I was especially encouraged
about the movement toward more
doctoral programs,” said DeToye,
chair

a significant drop in class size.
M um phard also worried
about the chancellor’s comment
on the possibility o f SIUE raising
its academic standards.
“If there are stricter policies,
it could cut back on diversity,”
Mumphard said.
M umphard m entioned that
Special Services often works
with students who need the
tutoring that her departm ent
provides. With higher standards,
M um phard fears these same
students might have a harder time
getting accepted to SIUE.
Barbara Havis, an assistant
professor of curriculum in the
School of Education, said she
believes the university still has “a
lot of work to do.” Although
Havis admitted the university has
shown significant progress, she
said there is still work to be done
to get SIUE to the next level.

“We don’t want to take a
back seat to any other university,”
Havis said. “We do a creditable
job.”
Havis was also impressed by
the chance of SIUE increasing its
degree and doctoral programs.
She hopes the improvements will
help SIUE to maintain an identity
separate from its sister school at
Carbondale. Havis said people
often confuse the schools. She
said she wants SIUE to get credit
for its programs.
Havis and Koehnecke also
com m ented on how many
students m issed the address.
Havis felt that classes should
have been canceled for an event
of this importance. Havis said she
felt many students and faculty
missed out.
“If you don’t play it up well
enough, students w on’t come,”
Havis said.

more housing is attracting many
new students,” Sill said.
In addition to freshm en
enrollment, gains were made in
graduate students’ registration.
G raduate enrollm ent on the

students in 1994 to 1,897 in
1998, although this increase has

not been continuous.

Warner, said in a recent press
release that he believes there are
a number of factors contributing
to SIUE’s enrollment success,
including its academic reputation
as well as the quality of oncampus student life.

considerably,” Werner said.
Citing the new Engineering
Building, W erner w ent on to
speak of his commitment to rehabbing the East St. Louis
Center, promising a new building
for the site by 2001. He said that
we need “a facility equal in
quality in East St. Louis.”
In
other
building
developments, W erner said the
growth is positive and that there
are plans for a third residence
hall to be built by 2001.
On the downside, Werner
indicated enrollment of minority
students is down, with the

num ber o f black students
receiving degrees dropping from
13 percent to 11 percent. SIUE’s
number of black students has
dropped as well. Werner said the
university is com m itted to
“making this campus open for
all,” adding, “We must continue
our journey down the pathway of
harmony.”
Werner noted that SIUE
loses 30 percent of its freshmen
after their first year, much like
any university. Werner said that if
the current trend continues, SIUE
will lose 425 of the freshmen by
the end of next semester.

SIUE workers protest
before Werner speech
BY DANIELLE BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
SIUE civil service workers
held an informational picket in
front of the University Center
W ednesday
just
before
Chancellor David Werner gave
his “State of the University”
address.
Workers were protesting
their wages, which they claim are
the lowest -of all civil service
workers in Illinois.
Workers
showed
their
solidarity by wearing green
clothing
and
buttons.
Approximately 40 workers were
at the main entrance to the
University Center, passing out

fliers with wage statistics and
other information, including a
message that could be mailed to
SIU President Ted Sanders.
The workers, who are
members of the American
Federation of State, County and
M unicipal Em ployees Local
2887, claim in the flier that “if
there is enough money to provide
for a 2 percent equity (raise) for
faculty, why isn’t there money to
pay civil service employees a
better wage?”
This is the second picket on
campus this year. The first, held
by SIUE building service
workers, took place during
Welcome Week. They were also
picketing over low wages.

Greek Week coming to end
The 16 sororities and
fraternities, totaling nearly 500
student members, of SIUE are
taking part in Greek Week.
Greek Week winds down
with a greek picnic at 5 p.m. on
Thursday and an awards program
at 3 p.m. on Friday. Awards will
be presented to the winners of

greek week and other events for
the year.
Also, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
on Thursday, the greeks will have
philanthropy booths set up on
campus to raise money and
collect goods
for various
charities in the area.

One possible reason for the
drop in enrollment is a strong
job market. Tarpey said that
rather than attending college, a
growing number of people may
be choosing to enter the
workforce. However, Tarpey
also said that there is no way to
gauge this factor.
The report set a goal of
increasing black enrollment to a
percentage comparable to the
black population in the region
and in the state. To obtain this
goal, SIUE has beefed up its
recruitment efforts in areas of
Chicago that are dominantly
black.
Our sister school, SIUC,
has had success with this
method. In the last five years,
the percentage of black entering
freshmen has gone up from 18.4
percent in 1993 to 20 percent in
1997.
In
addition,
the
percentage
of
SIUC’s
population that is black is

greater than the proportion of
blacks in Illinois’ population.
Tarpey suggested that this
might be because train service
runs directly from Chicago to
Carbondale, providing easier
transportation for students.
SIUC has also provided housing
opportunities for students away
from home, whereas SIUE has
historically been prim arily a
commuter school.
SIU E’s evolution away
from a commuter campus may
provide a jum p-start for the
recruiting process. More than
2,300 students are currently
living in university housing and,
for the first time in SIUE’s 33year history, the majority of
freshmen are living on campus.
D espite the increase in
overall population, a continued
focus will be placed on the
potential factors for the decrease
in black population. Between
these efforts and enhanced
recruitment, the university is
working
to
regain black
enrollment on campus.

“We can’t be complacent
with our record,” he said.
In noting the growth of
faculty, Werner cited a remark by
a colleague: “I’ve been here so
long, I don’t know anyone
anymore.” Werner admitted he
sometimes feels the same way
with so many new instructor» on
campus.
Currently, 37 percent of the
faculty are women and 6.2
percent are African-American.
Werner said he hopes to see both
those figures change, with
women eventually reaching 50
percent and blacks achieving the

same percentages as the black
student population. SIUE full­
time faculty teaches 80 percent
of the courses'and despite the
enrollm ent increases, there is
only a 14.9 student to faculty
ratio.
Among the goals Werner
outlined were: plans to add one
new
undergraduate
degree
program per year for the next six
years, to increase student
retention, work on accreditation
for the five rem aining non­
accredited departm ents and
eventually increasing admission
standards.

Some days are better than others Commentary
I really didn’t want to get up Wednesday morning.
I woke up as I do every morning, really sleepy. I knew I was going to have a long day. I
had papers to rewrite, a presentation to give, a speech to cover for the Alestle, two classes to
attend and a newspaper to put together. Plus I was sick all day. But 1 didn’t have much of a
choice. All I could think about was how this place annoyed me so.
I didn't want to go to class and chuckled as I recalled how one of my professors had once
Danielle
Belton reterred to SIUE as the Wal-Mart of college education. Though I originally wanted to attend
school here, some days I would wonder why that was. My father kept getting SIUE confused
with Carbondale when I was trying to enroll here. Today was one of those days when 1 wondered if I should
have gone to Carbondale. After all, the newspaper there has a printing press and a building. Such a boring
little school we have here, I would think some days. Nothing ever happens.
When I arrived at the University Center to cover the speech, a group of women and a few men were
standing in front of the building dressed in green and white. They all had on shiny white buttons and were
passing out fliers. Oddly enough, I wasn’t given one. Normally, I’m a flier magnet.
My stomach rumbled because I hadn’t eaten breakfast as I made my way to the Meridian Hall. I felt
weak from my nausea, but I knew this had to be covered because if I didn't do it, it wouldn’t get done. And
there are just some stories you can’t cancel on.
When I got there, the first thing I thought was, “I hope this isn’t going to be boring.” As a matter of
fact, I just knew this was going to be boring. I just kept thinking how I was probably going to have to fight
to stay awake. I joked with our photographer that maybe we should play a game of telephone with the
picketing civil service workers to spark some excitement. You know the game: You whisper a story to one
person and she repeats it to the next and so on until you’ve got quite a tale at the end. It was suggested we
start with something along the lines of, “Did you hear he’s really taking the raise?” and see what the quote
becomes after it traveled through the line. But we decided that wasn't the day to bring back yellow
journalism.
I kept fantasizing that maybe the civil service workers were going to do something outrageous, like
jump up and start singing “My Country ‘tis of Thee” in the middle of the chancellor’s address. I watched a
documentary the other night about Muhammad Ali called “Aka Cassius Clay” that showed the protests and
sit-ins of the ‘60s. I daydreamed about all those women in green and white, some the same age as my
mother, getting up and chanting, “Hell no, we won’t go!”
But this isn't the ‘60s, and this wasn’t a sit-in. I watched as all the workers politely found their seats
and waited for the address to begin. People tell me there used to be protests on this campus all the time
during the ‘60s and ‘70s, but I find that hard to believe. It’s a whole other world here now. People barely
get upset enough to write a letter to the editor about the university. How did they ever get up enough energy
to protest anything?
Snapping out o f my daydream, I realized that I had better find a seat. The back had filled up quickly,
and it looked like there was going to be quite a crowd. As I maneuvered to the front 1 noticed that it was
practically empty. The people at the address were not much different from the students in the classes. No
one wants to sit up front in English 101, hardly anyone sat up front at the speech either.
I sat in the front for two reasons. One, because I wanted to be able to see the chancellor's face clearly,
and two, because I didn’t want to sit next to anyone else. Part of me also wanted the officials to notice that
the Alestle was there to cover the event. I'm pretty big on being seen.
The speech began and I was surprised. It wasn’t boring. Chancellor Werner isn't the most fiery of
speakers, but he was very direct and informative. I was surprised and fascinated at where this university is
headed, and I wondered what was it becoming. I thought how I was attending SIUE while it is still in its
stages of transition from commuter school to residential school. Right now it has a sort of half-made bed
feeling. It’s finished in some ways and in others still looks a mess.
I daydreamed about what this place would be like in 20 years if the administration is able to keep up
the pace. Would I be able to come back to this campus and see an entirely different picture? At the rate the
school is going and growing, SIUE is on the path of becoming one of the largest and most popular
universities in the Midwest. People from St. Louis might regard SIUE in the same way they talk about St.
Louis University, or even in the same way they talk about Carbondale.
After the speech was over, I sat and talked with three professors from the Department of Education. All
reflected the optimism of the chancellor’s speech. One woman, Barbara Havis, was concerned about how
SIUE doesn’t get credit for its programs because it’s often confused with Carbondale. After listening to the
speech and hearing what she said, I thought maybe someday it would be the other way around.

Book details impeachment
WASHINGTON (AP) Only one president, Andrew
Johnson, was im peached and
forced to stand trial in the Senate.
One American who knows much
about that 1868 proceeding is
Chief Justice W illiam
H.
Rehnquist, who would preside
over a Senate trial for President
Clinton.
In his 1992 book "Grand
Inquests,” Rehnquist detailed the
House impeachment and Senate
trial of Johnson and those
conducted in 1804 for Supreme
Court Justice Samuel Chase.
“He probably knows more
about impeachment than anyone
else,” Washington lawyer John
Roberts says.
The
House
Judiciary
Committee must decide whether
Independent Counsel Kenneth
S tarr’s
report
suggesting
impeachable conduct by Clinton
requires impeachment hearings.
If such a full inquiry led to
articles of impeachment, the full
House would have to vote
whether to impeach - the
political equivalent o f an
indictment.
Selected House members
then would serve as prosecutors,
and the 100 senators as a jury.
W ashington law yer Theodore
Olson cites the “scholarly detail”
of Rehnquist’s book in calling
him “one of the experts.”
The book tracks two historic
Senate trials that ended in
acquittals, not ouster from office.
Rehnquist suggests that in each
the Senate put aside partisan
politics to reach results that best
aided the nation and the integrity
of the process.
“There were undoubtedly
political partisans on both sides
of the aisle in each case, but each
time enough members of the
majority party balked at the
demands for party unity to acquit
both Chase and Johnson,” he
wrote.

A two-thirds vote of those
senators participating is needed
for conviction and ouster by the
Senate.
Noting that the Supreme
Court’s 1998-99 term beginning
Oct. 5 could yield the fewest
decisions of any term in decades,
Roberts says, “If the chief justice
finds
he
has
additional
obligations this year, he should
be able to attend to them .”
At the nation’s highest couit,
Rehnquist has the well-earned
reputation of running a tight ship.
He
zealously
keeps
oral
argument
proceedings
on
schedule, sometimes cutting off
attorneys in mid-sentence. His
eight colleagues suggest in
private that he runs the court’s
closed-door deliberations in
much the same manner.
Such instincts might have to
be suppressed in a Senate trial,
however. In Johnson’s trial last
century, most of the procedural
disputes were resolved by the
Senate itself and not presiding
Chief Justice Salmon Chase.
The Johnson trial took
nearly two months, but those
who know Rehnquist well say it
might have been much shorter
had the current chief justice been
on the scene.
A lifelong
Republican,
Rehnquist was appointed to the
Supreme Court in 1972 by
President Richard Nixon, and
was elevated to the chief justice’s
job in 1986 by President Ronald
Reagan.
In
the
early
1980s,
Rehnquist
often
told
acquaintances he could not
picture himself still working at
age 70. But his promotion and
his wife’s death in 1991 changed
his retirement time-schedule.
He will be 74 in two weeks,
but no one expects Rehnquist to
retire before the presidential
election in 2000.

*AV£S

BY C O R EY STULCE
WRITER-AT-LARGE
cstulce@siue.edu
I know quite a few college
students, and all of them have
lots of stress. It’s ju st hard to
juggle all of the things that
dominate the day, be it studying,
a night job, socializing or
alcohol. Actually, the latter
seems to alleviate my stress as
well as add to it.
So I try to avoid things that
irk me the wrong way. But for
some reason, I keep noticing
things that make me say, “What
the hell is wrong with the
world?”
I completely loathe the hype
surrounding the fall television
season. Why must the networks
make such a huge deal every
year about 40 new shows that are
going to be canceled before the
first commercial break even hits?
They try to make us feel as if our
lives will be empty if we don’t
sit on the couch night after night
and watch this tired crap.
I can hear that bellowing
voice, the one that does all the
narration of movie previews,
saying, “DON'T MISS ONE
EPISODE OF ‘FRIEN D S’ THIS
SEASON, BECAUSE YOU
W O N T BELIEVE WHAT
WILL HAPPEN NEXT!” Gee,
let me guess: they’ll have sex
and talk about sex and maybe
some of them will get together
and complain about sex.
And then there’s the
commercials. If I see that little
rodent Taco Bell chihuahua one
more freakin’ time ... Why has
he not gotten violent diarrhea yet
and died? I would give a kidney
if I could punt that dog into the
ocean. Great, I can hear PETA
getting ready to phone me right
now.
I can also certainly live
without remakes of songs that
are not begging to be remade.
Do we need a sub-par pop group
remaking another sub-par pop
group’s song? (i.e., “Cruel
Summer.”) The ditty, which was
OK in the ‘80s, is barely a
decade old and now some candyass, Euro-trash, ABBA-esque
pop foursome like Ace of Bass
needs to redo it?
So to alleviate my stress, I
will continue to watch reruns of
“The Simpsons” and listen to
good ‘80s trash like Adam Ant
and Dexy’s Midnight Runners.

M a n n lic h e r -C a r c a n o

K
M eet
the
A lestle’s
new
a d v i c e
colum nist, Alii »
Khat.
.
Khat is in an
excellent position
to offer words of
wisdom to people
with problems because
she’s been on the SIUE
campus for more than six
years.
“I’ve always wanted to write
a column like Abby or Ann,”
Khat said. “After all, I’ve had
lots of experiences and perhaps
my knowledge will save someone
from the misfortunes and mistakes
I’ve suffered.’
Khat originally came to SIUE to
study sociology. “I’ve always_
wanted to help people,”
she
said.
She
later
switched majors, first to psychology, then nursing, then
education, then physical therapy. “It was all so confusing. I
want to devote my life to helping others but studying was so
hard,” she said.
She said enlightenment came during a Jerry Springer
episode that featured battling bisexual roommates. “I
realized then that so many people need help, and I could do
that while reaching out to many, many others.”
The super-senior is now a mass comm major and said
she hopes to graduate “sometime in the next century.” She
added, “Hey, don’t laugh, buddy. It’s closer than you think."
You’ve met Khat. Now take a look at her first column in
the Alestle. You'll find it in next Thursday’s Lifestyle
section. Send letters fo f Alii Khat to: The Alestle, Box 1167,
Attn: Alii Khat or drop them off at the Alestle’s office.

The inability to p u t th e ball in the net has
the S IU E m e n ’s soccer team carrying a
dism al 1-5 re c o rd in to this w e e k e n d ’s

The C ougars will try to get on the winning

The U niversity o f Indianapolis will pay a
visit to B ob G u e lk e r Field on S unday
afternoon.
“ In d ia n a p o lis is a very co m p etitiv e
team ,” head coach E d H u n e k e said. “They
have a n um ber of good English players that
will be a handful.”
The C ougars fell to 0-2 as they began
th eir conference schedule last w eekend on
the road.

B efore the gam e, ju n io r Justin B erniax

D oes anybody know the score? —
The baseb all season is com ing to an end
for th e St. L ouis C ardinals. T he season
will o b v io u sly be m a rk e d by th e
a c c o m p lish m e n ts o f stro n g m a n M ark
M cG w ire. It o c c u rre d to m e T uesday

p ro b a b ly d o n ’t know m uch a b o u t the
C ardinals season.
M ost p eo p le w ho are n o t hard-core
b aseb all fan s can tell you how m any
ho m ers M cG w ire has and probably how
m any Sam m y Sosa has. This race has
cap tiv ated o u r a tten tio n , and I try n o t to
miss an at-b at. Y et aside from w atching
M cG w ire hit, how m any people w atch
th e g am e? W h en M cG w ire is up,
con v ersatio n s com e to a halt, hom ew ork

stops, people from all over converge on
th e telev isio n o r ra d io n earby. A fte r
M cG w ire does his business, it is like the
scene in “Jerry M aguire” w hen he is fired,
and everyone is at silent a tten tio n . A s
soon as he leaves the building, the hustle
and b u stle o f everyday life continues.
Personally, on Tuesday I was flipping
back and forth betw een the gam e and the
season prem ier o f “M ad A b o u t Y ou.” Hey,
w hat would you ra th e r w atch, E li M arrero
go 0 for 3 or H elen H unt w rap p ed in a

Anty/CorUgmeyu*
B ran d o n and K elly o n “B everly H ills
90210.” O nce again I will be flipping
channels. T h u rsd a y is no co n test: the
season p re m ie r o f “ F rie n d s” vs. the
M ontreal Expos. T he rem o te control will
be getting a w o rk o u t this w eek. O ne
C ardinal gam e th a t pro b ab ly will keep my
atten tio n will be S u n d ay ’s season finale.
Sure it’s the last gam e, M cG w ire will put
his signature on history with his last at-bat.
B ut m ost im portantly, the only o th e r thing
on television will be th e Rams.
Where to be this weekend:
The w om en’s volleyball team keeps

enjoy good volleyball, you will find it here. A n d fo r those who
think w o m en ’s sp o rts are too slow, com e out an d let these ladies
p o un d a few balls in y our direction. I g u aran tee you will change
your m ind.
S aturday is a H U G E gam e for th e w o m en ’s soccer team .
T hey’re off to a stro n g 3-1 start, b u t the St. Jo se p h ’s College
Pum as are com ing to tow n at 3 p.m. Saturday. T he Pum as are
ran k ed #6 nationally, and the p resen t group o f seniors on the
Lady C ougars sq u ad is 1-5 against St. Joe fo r th eir careers.
Coach B rian K orbesm eyer has 99 career wins as the w om en’s
coach, and th e re w ould be no sw eeter way to get #100 th an to
beat th e Pum as. To d o so, career leading sco rer Janece Friederich
will have to p ro v e th a t she is one o f the b est in th e nation. If
M egan B eagles can m atch F riederich’s intensity up top, they
could be a d ead ly duo. In the backfield K arin T ighe and Tasha
Siegel will have to be as vocal as they have ever b e e n in directing
others around. A n d for th e freshm en, well, get rea d y for som e
big-tim e soccer. I h ope to see you fans at th e gam es this
w eekend. T hey should b e exciting.
