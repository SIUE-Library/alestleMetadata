SIUE proposes 100 percent plus parking increase
Students, faculty and staff may have to pay $55 extra within the next two years
By Roy Gilmore

Increase and parking
stickers are two phrases that
go hand in hand when dealing

February 29, at m idnight, will be the last chance that people who
participated in phone fraud can take advantage of the Am nesty Program.
This past summer, university officers at SIU E discovered that, over the
past two years, over $1 million in long-distance phone calls had been
defrauded from the school.
In D ecem ber, the A m nesty Program was created to give the people who
took advantage of the code that was used to charge the university for their
phone calls a chance to m ake arrangem ents for repaym ent without the fear
of being prosecuted.
According to SIU E, there have been a large num ber of people who have
contacted the university and are now taking advantage of the Am nesty
Program.
“As of last night, over 670 people have called,” Ken Neher, vice
chancellor of A dm inistration, said. “Yesterday alone, there were over 100
phone calls.”
The university even had to add m ore workers to man the phone-lines to
answer questions and to accept confessions. W hat once started out as a oneperson job has ended up taking eight people to accomplish.
But time is running out. T here will be no exceptions. Those who miss the
Feb. 29 deadline will lose the chance to participate in the Am nesty Program,
which could lead to very serious consequences.
If the total am ount of an individual’s bill exceeds $300, under Illinois law,

Science Building's tile buckles
and cracks from shifting floor
By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
“We heard a loud crack coming from the back
of the room near the wall,” Professor Lyman
H olden said, “and we thought that the sound
was coming from the o ther classroom. O ne of
the students I was talking to said, ‘W hat’s th at?’
and the other said, ‘I d o n ’t know, let’s get out of
h ere.’ T hen we heard a loud crack and a pop and
saw that the tile in one of the walkways in the
classroom had raised up a ten foot section.”
Professor H olden and two of his students
experienced the buckling and cracking tile
Tuesday aftern o o n , p rio r to H o ld en ’s class
lecture in statistics. N either the students nor the
professor were hurt.
This is not the first time th at the flooring in
the Science Building has buckled and cracked.
In fact, the third floor of the science building has
had problem s of tile buckling as well.
The buckling is attributed to the fact that
when the quarry tile was laid in the Science
Building, no expansion joints were added, Len
M enoni, of Facilities M anagem ent, said.

to expand and contract, allowing the tile above it to shift accordingly.
However, since the concrete base in this classroom did not contain the expansion joints, the
result was the buckling of the tile above, M enoni said.
Classes scheduled for the classroom were moved to other classrooms Wednesday morning,
and a tem porary flooring made of plywood was laid so classes could be held Wednesday
afternoon, M enoni said.
M enoni does not give blame to the contractors for the lack of expansion joints in the
flooring since the joints were not put in the original plan.
M enoni also said that due to the expense of removing the flooring and putting in the
expansion joints, the joints will not be placed in the floors and the contractors are just re-tiling
the floor today.

letter to the editor--------------------------------------------

Former president clarifies
accessibility complaints
I would like to respond to the article in the Feb. 1 issue of the
Intelligencer entitled “Students Q uestion SIU E Accessibility.”
My nam e is R obert W. Fleming; I was the president of the
New Horizons organization from 1992 through 1995. The New
Horizons organization is an organization that protects the
rights and meets the needs of students with a disability on the
campus of SIUE.
I agree with B renda Bertels that there are accessibility
problem s on the S IU E campus. How ever, she has failed
mention the fact that a vast m ajority of her accessibility
problems have been addressed by the A D A com m ittee on
campus. Bertels would have known this if she had done some
investigating before whining to the newspaper.
I would like to respond to B ertel’s com plaint on the lack of
support given to the students with disabilities from the
Disability Support Services.
During my presidency, I was confronted by B ertels regarding
accessibility problem s that concerned her on two different
occasions. I im m ediately responded to these accessibility
problems and I have each one of my responses docum ented.
I feel that socializing and being visible to the public is a very
im portant com ponent in the abolishm ent of the negative
stereotypes associated with people with disabilities.
It is true that the New Horizons organization has had two
pizza and bowling parties in the past. However, B ertels failed to
explain the reason for these parties. The reason for these parties
was to show our appreciation to SIU E for m aking the bowling
alley wheelchair accessible after 26 years.
It may be true that Bertels does not need any help in
socializing with others. Nonetheless, 1 feel that there is a need
for Bertels to do a m ore thorough job investigating her
complaints before making unjustifiable statements.

Former President of New Horizons

SIUE professors have virtues
black students should strive for
E ditor’s note: This letter is being printed
anonym ously because the students asked that
it run this way so other students won 7 feel that
they are trying to improve their grades.
Now that Black History M onth is coming
to a close, we feel that it is only fitting that we
acknowledge the strength and character of at
least two of S IU E ’s outstanding black
faculty—Professors Fred Stokes and Jennifer
Ham er-Cotten.
These two possess many of the virtues that
black SIU E students should strive for. They
are intelligent. They work hard. They are
successful due to their efforts. They are
p atien t and caring tow ards students. In
addition, they bring a dynamic style and
vitality to the classroom that we think is

unique. Not only are we learning, but we have
fun doing it.
They attend one an o th er’s classes and this
suggests that they not only share ideas in
regards to teaching, but that they have a
m utual respect and adm iration of each other.
W hen we as African-A m erican students
witness this team effort inside and outside the
classroom , we feel enorm ous pride. They
m ake us realize that with determ ination and
strength we can achieve anything. It is with
pride and gratitude that we write this letter.
Black History M onth is ending and we will
not h ea r m uch ab out “g re a t” A fricanAm ericans until next February. However, we
should feel pride in knowing that two of
African A m erica’s very best are right here at
SIUE.

Housing management goes to great
lengths to help solve student problems
I have been living at Tower Lake A partm ents since N ovem ber 1994. D uring my stay here I
have heard a lot of negative com m ents and criticism about m anagem ent both at the Commons
building and the main Housing Office.
I have dealt with the Housing Office on a few occasions. I have found them to be very prom pt
and helpful, going to great lengths to solve the problem s and accom m odate the needs of the
student.
I just want to take this opportunity to praise the m anagem ent at the H ousing Office and
Commons building. Their services are caring, efficient and excellent.

Campus Comments
What do you think should happen to the people arrested for phone fraud?

“They should lose phone
privileges for 20 years.”

“They should be led
clothed in loin clothes into
the Quad and flogged with
phone cables.”

“I believe that they should
be fined for their phone calls,
but not kicked out of
school.”

“ Everyone was given the
opportunity to come forward.
Those who chose not to take
advantage o f amnesty
deserve what they get.”

“I believe that they should
be jailed if the policy says
so.”

T hree S IU E educators
have recently released a
book titled “P aren ts and
Teachers as Partners: Issues
and C hallenges,” dealing
with parental involvement in
education.
R o b ert
E.
Rockwell,
professor
and
program
director of Early Childhood
E ducation in the departm ent
of
C urriculum
and
Instruction,
collaborated
with SIU E alumni Lynda C.
A ndre, now a kindergarten
teacher for the Edwardsville
C om m unity Schools, and
M ary K. Howley, a B irth to
Five resource specialist, over
the past three years in writing
the book. Both women were
form er students of Rockwell.
T he book was written to
fill the need for an organized
system to introduce teachers
to
th e
benefits
of
constructive communications
with parents.
“E arly
childhood
program s m ust not only
welcom e
p arents,
but
actively encourage and seek
th eir particip atio n in the
education of their children,”
Rockwell said. “Teachers and
adm inistrators must have the
skill and desire to involve all
families in meaningful roles
within the school community.
P arents of cultural, ethnic,
and familial differences must
perceive the school as ‘their’
school.”
R ockw ell feels th at the
book has been released at an
opportune time.
“This book is coming out
at a time th at it is really
needed. I’ve w ritten many
books, but this is the one I’ve
always w anted to w rite,”
Rockwell said.
T he
book
discusses
traditio n al
m eans
of
communicating with students
subjects such as report cards
and
p aren t/teach er
conferences. It also explores
volunteerism , field trips and
even video communication.
“We focus on a multitude
of strategies that aren’t textbookish— they are all field
tested betw een the three of
us,” Rockwell said.
While all teachers may not
utilize all of the techniques
found in the book, Rockwell
hopes to see teachers using
w hatever m ethods they feel
are most helpful.
1 “It’s like getting in a boat.
Pull on one oar and you go in
circles. Pull on both oars and
you can reach a com m on
goal.
T h a t’s
p arental
involvem ent to m e,” said
Rockwell.
The book was published
by H arcourt Brace College
Publishers and is available in
the SIU E bookstore.

A nother change Vanzo has discussed is
keeping the University C enter parking lot
open all of the time.
“We kept it open over break and charged

said.
Vanzo also said that none of the increased

But th at’s not how Bob Vanzo, director of
Adm inistrative Services, looks at the increase.
“We didn’t set o ur prices to com pare to
other universities,” he said,” it was was just
used as a m easure of reasonability.”
Not only will students have to pay m ore to
park, faculty, and that includes
Chancellor Belck, will have to
start paying for parking.
“In the fall, all uraversity
vehicles will have to pay to
park,” Vanzo said. “They might
not buy a decal for the vehicles,
but they will have to pay a fee
for parking.”
Also, Vanzo said th at there
will be a fee assessed to those
organizations that ask that no

event they are holding.
“Many organizations ask for

to pay a small fee to do so,” he
said.

issue that will be dealt with.
Also in the bond proposal package was the option
for a shuttle bus, but this was later dropped.
“It was just going to be used for evening classes and
basically it was another measure of security, but the
cost of the bus would have increased the parking prices
another five dollars,” Vanzo said.
The bond proposal is not carved in stone yet. The
proposal still has to await approval from the board of
trustees and President Ted Sanders. Then, if they get
approval, they will have to interview for an
engineering firm, hopefully by February of next year,
to do the work.
“We hope to be able to bid in February because that
is one of the slow months for asphalt companies and
hopefully that would increase the am ount of
engineering companies wanting to bid for our project
and possibly decrease our cost a little bit,” Vanzo said.
Vanzo also pointed out that if the bids went out for
the entire project, instead of one or two lots at a time,
the bid could be decreased and more firms would be
interested in the total project.
“Everyone has to realize that there is no money
coming from the state for this project. Everything
generated must come from within—fees, fines and
meters,” Vanzo said. “If we see that we have been too
conservative (set the prices too high), we can still lower
the rates at any time. But in the same token, we can
also increase the prices if something drastic beyond
our control happens.”

Lighting the candles of hope
By Darryl Howlett
Lifestyle Editor
They were small in number, but large in spirit. It was
cold outside, but the flames of dedication and
celebration were enough to warm them.
On Tuesday, several SIUE students
attended a candlelight march,
documentary and discussion
entitled “Eyes On The Prize.”
However, not only the past
was discussed, but also
the present and future
of African-Americans.
DeMarcus Miller,
along with the Black
History Programming
Committee,
sponsored the first
annual event.
“The purpose of
this evening is to
pay our respects
to the great
leaders who have
helped us light
our way to
college,” Miller,
who is majoring in
political science
said. “We want
everybody to know
and understand that
they were people
who fought hard to
get us here. We need
to bring spme unity of
the past back on this
campus,” Miller said.
The cold, chilling winds
diminished any attempt to
light candles for the march, but
the students were determined to
light candles as the vigil was brought
inside the Commons TV lounge. With
the successful lighting of the
candles, a stirring rendition of
the Black National Anthem
“Lift Every Voice And Sing”
was sung while the light of
every candle shined. Each
student sang in unison as
the last of the song came:
“ ... let us march on until
victory is won ...”
The documentary “Eyes
On The Prize” is a highlyextolled project which has
aired on PBS in recent
years. The students reacted
to the speeches on Malcolm
X, Martin Luther King, Stokely
Carmichael, with eyes focused.
Then came the speeches of the Black
Panthers and the view of the Watts Riots. Students
were actually grimacing as they watched marchers

being ridiculed and beaten on their
march to Jackson, Mississippi to take
up the march of James Meridith,
who became the first AfricanAmerican to enter the University
of Mississippi.
After the film,
students gave their
impressions of
the past and
compared it
to the
present.
“I

know,
outside of
America,
control of
government is different in
other countries. In my
country of Barbados, we
control the government we
are a majority. When I
look at this country, I see
the great leaders such as
Malcolm X, Martin Luther
King. However, I do not
see a leader today to
capture the attention of
African-Americans,”
Andrew Carrington said.
Carrington, 3 0 , is a grad
student who is now trying to
get a degree in finance.
Another student, Chandra
Crudup, saw a similar problem
in the African-American
community.
“During that time period,
political leaders provided different
ideals, but they still reached for a
common goal. Today it will be hard to
get everyone to move in the same direction.
In the process we are watching our
communities fall from grace,” Crudup said.
“Also, back then it was blatant racism and now we
have a type of institutionalized racism. So it must be
handled differently than before. Instead of one person
or leader to make change, it is everyone’s job.”
Other subjects covered during the discussion included
economic empowerment of the black community, lack of
participation on campus and the breakdown of the
family in many African-American communities.
After the program, all those who attended felt the
importance of the event.
“Overall, the program went very well. But I believe
more participation was needed from our AfricanAmerican brothers and sisters. But I do believe that we
need to keep organizing programs like this,” Stacey
Keith said.
Those who left the first-time event rededicated
themselves with spreading the word of the need of unity
and cooperation with those last verses of “Lift Every
Voice And Sing,” still ringing in the hearts and minds of
the students.
II
Let us march on until victory is won.”

SIUE teams excel at Schick Super Hoops regional event
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor

Jerem y Paschall/A/esf/e

Da Chronic poses for a picture in the jackets they
received for their championship. (I to r) W oodrow
Shivers, Dan W illis, Mo Rodgers and Keith Barnes.

Sunday is supposed to be a day for rest, but for two
groups of SIU E students, last Sunday was anything
but restful.
D a Chronic and C ourt Masters, two basketball
team s from the SIU E intram ural program , travelled
Sunday to the U niversity of Illinois-Chicago to
com pete in the midwest regional of the Schick Super
Hoops 3-on-3 basketball tournam ent and both teams
were successful in their efforts. D a Chronic captured
first place while C ourt M asters finished third.
D a Chronic knocked off a team from Michigan
State in the semifinals while Court M asters lost to a
team from the University of Illinois. Da Chronic then
went on to beat the U of I team in overtim e for the
championship.
“We had to play seven games between about 10:30
and 3:30,” Mo Rodgers of Da Chronic said Wednesday
afternoon. “It was tough, I started to cramp up during
the last game.”
Rodgers was joined by D an Willis, Keith Barnes
and Woodrow Shivers on the team that last year
finished second at the same competition. The Court
M asters team was m ade up of Shawn R oundtree,
Dwayne Jones, Marvin Childs and Marcellus Walton.
D a C hronic has played in four tournam ents
representing the SIU E intram ural program and have
reached the championship game in every one. In the
intram ural league, their success is unm atched as
they’ve only lost two games in their nearly four years

together. B oth those losses have come to the Court
M asters with one of them being the championship
game of the SIU E Schick tournam ent on Feb. 10.
The team ’s success is no coincidence. The players
know what it takes to be successful.
“We play good together, everybody knows their
roles,” Rodgers said. “O ver the years w e’ve lost some
players, but w e’ve been able to find others to fill their
roles on the team .”
Willis was quick to add, “We know how to win ball
games. D efense wins and we m ake sure we play good
defense.”
H e went on to say that with a great scorer like
Rodgers, who played with Shivers on the SIU E
Cougar team for two years in the late 80s and early
90s, everybody else can concentrate m ore on the
defensive end.
W hen asked who their go-to-guy is, both Willis and
B arnes quickly respond, “Mo, without a doubt.”
“H e ’s the point guard and we want the ball in his
hands to m ake the decisions,” Willis continues. “He
always m akes good decisions.”
The C ourt M asters were form ed from Da Chronic
in an effort to try and help out the SIU E intram ural
league a few years back. R oundtree and Shivers split
from D a Chronic to form the foundation for the Court
M asters. Now, the two of them rem ain as that
foundation, but Shivers still plays with D a Chronic in
some tournam ents and R oundtree still joins them in
some league com petition around the area.

Evans chasing record
as Lady Cougars enter
final week of season
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter
The SIU E w om en’s basketball team has seen its ups and
downs the whole season. With only one senior on the team,
the younger players have seen their share of minutes. H ead
C oach W endy H edberg said in h er office on Tuesday
afternoon th at the experience received by the younger
players will help them better their record next season.
The Cougars have two rem aining games left on their
schedule.They host St. Joseph, who are just above them in the
conference standings and IU PU -Ft. Wayne, who owns the
second best record in the conference.
“We have trouble beating the team s above us,” said
Hedberg. “ I would like to finish the season on a good note
and a win against either of those team s will be extremely
satisfying. We lost to both team s earlier this season by close
margins so 1 have confidence that we can do i t ”
A big story for the team this season has been the play of
senior guard Terri Evans. She is the team ’s on court leader
and has a chance to set the career scoring record at SIUE.
She needs only eight points in the rem aining two games to
pass the 1,621 points of form er A ll-A m erican Lori Sebastian,
who played for the Cougars from 1987-1991.
Evans said Tuesday, “ I had an idea of where I was, but I
haven’t been concentrating on it.”
“This (record) speaks a lot o f Terri,” said Hedberg. “She’s
capable of scoring, but there are so many m ore things that she
does well. H er free throw percentage and her assists rank
am ong the top on the team .” .
H edberg said that she would like to see the women work
on their free throw shooting during the off season.
“Free throw s are what killed us at times. We lost games by
two or three or four points that we could have- won.”
►
The Lady Cougars will play at hom e against St. Joseph on
Thursday evening and IU PU -Ft. W ayne on Saturday.

Don't blink or you may miss him streaking
across the floor. I’m talking, of course, about
Shaun Smoot, the Cougars fleet-footed point
guard. The self-proclaim ed “m agician” is
m aking his first appearance in the the Cougar
C orner for his play against Bellarmine.
Smoot, a transfer student from Natchez,
Miss., looks like he is finally becom ing
com fortable with the C ougar’s offense. Even
though Shaun is not the focal point of the
offense, he put up some impressive num bers
last Saturday.
Smoot was 10-12 from the free throw line
w here he usually only shoots 68 percent.
Those ten points along with five field goals
gave him twenty points for the evening.
H e wasn’t done there though. H e also
padded the stat sheet with five rebounds and
nine assists. C oach M argenthaler had this
explanation for Sm oot’s sudden production.
“ We stepped up the pace and that
benefitted Shaun. They w eren’t too aggressive
on him and he took advantage of that,”
M argenthaler said.
The point guard isn’t expected to put up
big num bers in M argenthaler's offense, but is
expected to do other little things.
“H e ’s learned the system and slowed down
a bit. H e doesn’t turn the ball over as m uch as
he used to and his free throw shooting has
really im proved,” M argenthaler said.
Congratulations Shaun.

please see SCHICK, next page

Role Player. This term is often looked
dow n upon, yet every good team needs
quality role players to be successful.
This weeks m em ber of the Cougar Corner,
Cathy Wells, has had the unenviable task of
backing up Terri Evans at the point guard
position for the Lady Cougars.
“T here’s a bit o f pressure when I come into
the game for Terri because 1 have to be the
ball handler. I think my ball handling has
gotten better though and I’m making better
decisions,” Wells said.
Wells sees about eleven minutes of action
each game but she m akes the m ost of it by
playing a solid, m istake-free game. Wells has
wisely used h er tim e on the bench
productively. W hile waiting her turn, she
watches Evans and has picked up some things
that can help her own game.
‘T erri is very quick. She’s a good leader
and when we need som eone to step up, Terri
does,” Wells said.
Cathy knows her turn will come though
and sh e’s eagerly awaiting the challenge.
“We should have a good season next year.
It will be tough without Terri, but I’d like to be
som eone to step in and hopefully fill the role
she’s had,” Wells added.
Congratulations on your first time in the
Cougar C om er, Cathy.

Roundcount breaks school
record at Knox Invitational
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
Led by senior Travis R oundcount’s record
breaking perform ance in the 1,500-meter run,
The SIU E m en’s and w om en’s track team
traveled to Knox College and put up some
strong performances.
R o u n d co u n t’s tim e of 3 m inutes, 59.1
seconds, not only earned him a first place finish
but also broke a school record. The old record
stood at 4:1.5, set by Rudy Rocha, a form er AllA m erican in the 5,000 meters.
“It was an excellent race,” H ead Coach
D arryl Frerker said. “He took it from the gun
and never did let up.”
Also perform ing well for the men in the
1500 were Gus C oronado and Chris Wolf who
ro unded out th e top three positions.
C o ro n ad o ’s 4:4.2 second run placed him
second and Wolf followed real close behind
with a 4:4.6 second run.
“With Gus and Chris com peting well, this
was a very good intrasquad race,” F rerker said.
Wayne Bloem er also finished high in the
1,500 as he placed seventh to give the Cougars
four runners in the top ten of that race.
“Wayne is also running real strong. A nd he

Schick_____________________

Although D a Chronic and Court M asters
have played each other many times since they
divided up and are very competitive on the
court, many of the team m em bers are still
good friends off the court.

also doubled down with the o th er three
runners (R oundcount, Coronado and Wolf) to
break a field house record in the four by 800
relay and that was just awesome,” Frerker said.
On the wom en’s side, Colleen Casey once
again had a solid perform ance coming off her
record breaking run a weekend ago.
In the 1,500, Casey placed third with a time
of 4:55.9 seconds. Just four seconds off of
breaking another SIU E record.
“She also ran a strong race. She started off
fast but just got beat down the stretch,” Frerker
said. “Last time she broke the record in the
1,000 m eter and she wanted to come out and
break the school record in the 1,500 meter.
A nd she just missed it.”
O ther good races were from Kendra Newell
who finished third in the 800 m eter and Becky
H agenbruch who also finished third in the 400
meter.
Vickey Johnson finished a strong fourth in
the 3,000 m eter and Jacqi Vazquez came in
sixth in the 1,500 meter.
Also the 3,200-meter relay came in third
with Johnson, Newell, Casey and Hagenbruch.
“It is good to see the competitiveness out of
all the athletes that ran. It it is good indication
of the upcoming outdoor season,” Frerker said.
All of the players said that the ultimate
goal in Chicago was for an all SIU E final and
when the U of I team prevented that from
happening by beating C ourt M asters, it
provided extra incentive for Da Chronic to
beat them. The extra incentive was needed for
them to get through the cram ping and
weariness and bring home the crown.
