College students
should beware of
deadly meningitis

Dan Dorrance and Gay-Ann Blondell perform, along with the Gateway Horn Choir
quintet, Wed. during an event in the Goshen Lounge. It was sponsored by the
University Center Board during its “Center Stage ” series.

A recent report by the American College Health Association
recommends that college students consider pre-exposure vaccinations
against meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis.
Dr. Lee Johnson of the University Health Services said that
meningococcal meningitis is the most common of the two diseases.
Meningococcal meningitis is transmitted through the air via sneezing
or coughing and direct contact with persons infected with the disease.
It is extremely important to detect symptoms before they progress
because it can cause inflammation of the membranes surrounding the
brain and spinal chord.
Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis may include: a rash,
fever, nausea, vomiting, severe sudden headache accompanied by
lethargy and a stiff neck.
The use of an antibiotic called ciprofloxacin or rifampin is
recommended for those who have been exposed to the disease.

Belton appointed as new editor in chief of the Alestle
The position is finally filled after being vacant for almost an entire semester.
■ BY ZH ANDA
JO H N SO N
NEWS EDITOR
D anielle
Belton
was
approved
Friday
by
the
U niversity Publishing Board
Committee to take on the position
as the A lesile''s editor in chief.
The editor in chief position had
been vacant since Septem ber
1997 when the former Editor in
C hief
R ebecca
H opkins,
resigned.
Belton is a sophom ore

m ajoring
in
mass
communications. She has worked
for the A lestle since August 1997.
“ I started off as a news
reporter and two days later I was
news editor,” Belton said.
Belton said she is very happy
to be editor in chief. The position
will help her with her major
(mass communication) and give
her excellent experience.
Belton also said that she has
always loved to write and always
had an inquisitive mind. She said
she has the tendency to be nosey.

Growing up Belton watched
“60 Minutes,” which made her
want to be an investigative
reporter, and was fascinated by
journalists such as Mike Wallace
and Ed Bradley.
“I really have a deep passion
for w riting and reporting,”
Belton said.
Belton is from St. Louis, Mo.
She graduated from Hazelwood
Central High School in which she
also worked for the school
newspaper entitled “Hawk Talk.”
There she wrote for the editorial

page. She didn’t enjoy it
however, because the paper
didn’t represent the student body.
“It turned me off of
journalism for a while,” Belton
said. “However, nothing can keep
me from my true love.”
Belton’s goal for the A lestle
is to work toward making it an
“A ” newspaper. She wants to
give a top quality paper to
students, staff and faculty.
“I want it to be a reflection of
the
university
and
the
community,” Belton said.

In the
future,
B e l t o n
hopes to get
a
n
Danielle Belton
internship
in either
r a d i o ,
te lev isio n
or
print
journalism
and
eventually
to
graduate
from SIUE.
“I’m proud to be part of this
campus and part of the A lestle,
and I’m here to stay,” Belton

Various Greek organizations here at SIUE have many
different activities planned for the new year.

With the start of a new semester several SIUE
Greek organizations have many events and
programs planned. Although some of the events are
specifically geared toward fraternity and sorority
members, most of them have been developed to
involve all students.
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. has several
events planned for the spring semester. This
Saturday the sorority will host the Central

Regional U ndergraduate Leadership Seminar.
Alpha Kappa Alpha members from colleges in the
Central Region which includes 111., Ind., Iowa,
Ky., Mo., Minn, and Wis. will be involved in this
event held in Collinsville, 111.
“The skills that the sorors will develop will
lead Alpha Kappa Alpha into the next millennium,”
Vice President Meisha Lyons said.
Although the seminar is just for AKA’s, there
will be a party after the event which anyone can
attend. The party will take place Friday

Good intentions can go a long way for the environment
A few good intentions and
personal motivation can help the
com m unity
as
a
w hole.
Conservation o f the environment
is a very popular slogan all over
the world, but it is becoming
more difficult day by day. Simple
m atters often create com plex
problem s due to overuse and
misuse o f our natural resources,
but we can minimize all those
problems if we just use a little
effort. For example, municipal
solid waste management is an
immediate, critical problem in
our society. Its collection,
processing and disposal is
becoming an acute problem and it
is increasing day by day because
the amount of municipal solid
waste generation is going up and
the life o f landfills is becoming
short; setting up new landfills
is difficult because o f public
opposition.
In the USA, we are
producing an average of 6.09 lbs.
of waste per capita per day and in
1990, a total am ount o f 190
million tons of municipal solid
waste was generated. This figure
is alm ost double the am ount
generated in 1960 and is rising at
a rate of slightly over one percent
per year (Office of Technology

A ssessm ent. Facing A m erica’s
Trash: What Next for Municipal
Solid Waste. Washington D.C.,
1989). Across the country, the
cost o f solid waste collection,
processing and disposal is the
fourth highest category of
m unicipal
budgets.
The
Environm ental
Protection
Agency (EPA), state and city
authorities and private companies
are investing money to find out
the
best solution
to the
m anagem ent
problem s
of
m unicipal solid waste. Upon
discussion, the Madison County
Solid
Waste
C oordinator
concluded that increasing the
w aste
collection
bill
per
container is the only way to
reduce
the
generation
of
municipal solid waste. To control
the m unicipal solid waste
management problem, the EPA
adopted an integrated solid waste
management hierarchy composed
o f the following elements: source
reduction,
recycling,
waste
combustion and land filling. The
main objectives of the hierarchy
is the reduction o f m unicipal
solid waste generation and the
extension of landfill life. To solve
the m unicipal solid waste

problem ,

was found that

d id n ’t
think
about how it
might be a way
to reduce the

of

A study was carried out on generation. The average use of

majority of research involves
finding ways to reuse, recycle

generated due to the use of paper
tow els, w hich is about 1.05
percent o f total municipal solid
w aste generating (2225) per
capita per year. The results of
economic analysis (see graph)
show s a big financial benefit
from the use of handkerchiefs.
The cost for paper towels is
$39.21 for the same period, yet
by using handkerchiefs, it is
possible to minimize the rising
rate (1 percent per year) of
municipal solid waste generation.
The amount that could be saved
is $36.60 for each member of the
family per year. There may be
some questions that arise. For
exam ple, handkerchiefs need
frequent washing. Yes, but if we
are willing do a little extra work
in response to our feelings and
responsibilities to the problems
of the nation then there will be no
question
concerning
the
conservation of the environment
nor the survival o f the next
generation.

Letters to the e d ito r--------------------------------------------------------SIUE workers defend themselves against claims of incompetence
In response to Ellen Cottingham ’s comment about the
icy walkways, (“Ice, Ice Everywhere..., Jan. 13, 1998”),
Facilities M anagem ent is divided into different
departments with different responsibilities and duties.
Ellen, icy walkways are handled by the “Grounds and
Moving Service.” Janitors (excuse me) “Custodial
Service” or “Building Service Workers,” maintain the
interior of University buildings. Also, “Grounds and
Moving Services” are provided with the proper clothing
and footwear for working outside. The several people you
watched drinking coffee were probably part of “Building
Services Workers” and are responsible for the safety of
SIUE students and employees inside the buildings. If
yo u’re confused about the reason why the tuition
continues to increase, try getting involved in the Student
Governm ent, the U niversity Center Board or the
University Housing Committee. And I do agree, the
university probably needs to budget more money, so that
we can have the “Grounds and Moving Service” provide
around the clock safety outside. If you really want to get

Tonya Griffin
Student Worker, “Facilities Management”
Sophomore, Early Childhood Education
In response to Ellen Cottingham’s Letter to the Editor
in the Jan. 13, 1998 issue of the A lestle, “Ice, Ice
Everywhere...,” we would like to clarify some of the
incorrect information in her letter. First of all, ice and
snow removal is done by grounds personnel. Custodians
(janitors) have nothing to do with snow and ice removal.
Grounds personnel which once numbered in the 20s is
now down to a crew of seven with more roads, buildings

and parking lots to take care of. On the morning in
question, we started at our normal time as we were not
called out early. The crew is on call-out basis after normal
working hours. The workers seen drinking coffee were
custodial personnel and had not yet started their shift. We,
the grounds workers, put in hong hours (16, 20 or 24 hour
shifts) during snow and ice storms. With our crew down
to so few, we doubt that your rising tuition costs are due
to us. Two of our crew are currently tuition paying parents
and we do not want to see abuse of our tuition dollars any
more than Ellen Cottingham. We feel we do a good job
with the personnel available. It wotild be nice to receive a
pat on the back once in awhile instead of constant
criticism. We do our best.

Springer----------from page 8

Wilkos said he uses necessary
force when he intervenes
onstage. “This last show, a
woman was grabbing hair, and
women are hard to separate. But,
if you apply pressure to the wrist,
they’ll let go,” Wilkos said.
Being on the show has also
aided him at his other job as a
patrolm an. “I got a call last
night, dom estic, the whole
family is fighting. And we got
there and they’re like, ‘Oh,
you’re on Jerry!’ and they forget
about their problems. They want
to know if they can get tickets, t-

shirts, all that. I t’s kind of
making me a m ini-celebrity,”
Wilkos said.
W ilkos’ primary job on the
show is to protect Springer. But,
would he take a bullet for his
boss? “O f course I w ould,”
Wilkos said. “For one, Jerry’s
been very good to me, and not
too m any policem en get to
appear on a national TV show.
Second, I take a chance o f taking
a bullet everyday when I go to
work. So, o f course, I’d take one
for Jerry.”
Schultz defends the show

against accusations that it’s trash
television. “T hat’s what people
want to see. W e’ve always been a
wild, crazy show,” Schultz said.
“It’s fun now, let’s ride the wave
and see how long we can ride it.”
As a final thought, the “Jerry
Springer Show ” encom passes
many unique elements onstage
and backstage. Sure, it can be
wild and even a little bit trashy.
But, it never takes itself too
seriously. And it always ends on
a positive message from Jerry:
“Take care o f yourself, and
each other.”
