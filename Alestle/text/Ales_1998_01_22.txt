College students
should beware of
deadly meningitis

Dan Dorrance and Gay-Ann Blondell perform, along with the Gateway Horn Choir
quintet, Wed. during an event in the Goshen Lounge. It was sponsored by the
University Center Board during its “Center Stage ” series.

A recent report by the American College Health Association
recommends that college students consider pre-exposure vaccinations
against meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis.
Dr. Lee Johnson of the University Health Services said that
meningococcal meningitis is the most common of the two diseases.
Meningococcal meningitis is transmitted through the air via sneezing
or coughing and direct contact with persons infected with the disease.
It is extremely important to detect symptoms before they progress
because it can cause inflammation of the membranes surrounding the
brain and spinal chord.
Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis may include: a rash,
fever, nausea, vomiting, severe sudden headache accompanied by
lethargy and a stiff neck.
The use of an antibiotic called ciprofloxacin or rifampin is
recommended for those who have been exposed to the disease.

Belton appointed as new editor in chief of the Alestle
The position is finally filled after being vacant for almost an entire semester.
■ BY ZH ANDA
JO H N SO N
NEWS EDITOR
D anielle
Belton
was
approved
Friday
by
the
U niversity Publishing Board
Committee to take on the position
as the A lesile''s editor in chief.
The editor in chief position had
been vacant since Septem ber
1997 when the former Editor in
C hief
R ebecca
H opkins,
resigned.
Belton is a sophom ore

m ajoring
in
mass
communications. She has worked
for the A lestle since August 1997.
“ I started off as a news
reporter and two days later I was
news editor,” Belton said.
Belton said she is very happy
to be editor in chief. The position
will help her with her major
(mass communication) and give
her excellent experience.
Belton also said that she has
always loved to write and always
had an inquisitive mind. She said
she has the tendency to be nosey.

Growing up Belton watched
“60 Minutes,” which made her
want to be an investigative
reporter, and was fascinated by
journalists such as Mike Wallace
and Ed Bradley.
“I really have a deep passion
for w riting and reporting,”
Belton said.
Belton is from St. Louis, Mo.
She graduated from Hazelwood
Central High School in which she
also worked for the school
newspaper entitled “Hawk Talk.”
There she wrote for the editorial

page. She didn’t enjoy it
however, because the paper
didn’t represent the student body.
“It turned me off of
journalism for a while,” Belton
said. “However, nothing can keep
me from my true love.”
Belton’s goal for the A lestle
is to work toward making it an
“A ” newspaper. She wants to
give a top quality paper to
students, staff and faculty.
“I want it to be a reflection of
the
university
and
the
community,” Belton said.

In the
future,
B e l t o n
hopes to get
a
n
Danielle Belton
internship
in either
r a d i o ,
te lev isio n
or
print
journalism
and
eventually
to
graduate
from SIUE.
“I’m proud to be part of this
campus and part of the A lestle,
and I’m here to stay,” Belton

Various Greek organizations here at SIUE have many
different activities planned for the new year.

With the start of a new semester several SIUE
Greek organizations have many events and
programs planned. Although some of the events are
specifically geared toward fraternity and sorority
members, most of them have been developed to
involve all students.
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. has several
events planned for the spring semester. This
Saturday the sorority will host the Central

Regional U ndergraduate Leadership Seminar.
Alpha Kappa Alpha members from colleges in the
Central Region which includes 111., Ind., Iowa,
Ky., Mo., Minn, and Wis. will be involved in this
event held in Collinsville, 111.
“The skills that the sorors will develop will
lead Alpha Kappa Alpha into the next millennium,”
Vice President Meisha Lyons said.
Although the seminar is just for AKA’s, there
will be a party after the event which anyone can
attend. The party will take place Friday

Good intentions can go a long way for the environment
A few good intentions and
personal motivation can help the
com m unity
as
a
w hole.
Conservation o f the environment
is a very popular slogan all over
the world, but it is becoming
more difficult day by day. Simple
m atters often create com plex
problem s due to overuse and
misuse o f our natural resources,
but we can minimize all those
problems if we just use a little
effort. For example, municipal
solid waste management is an
immediate, critical problem in
our society. Its collection,
processing and disposal is
becoming an acute problem and it
is increasing day by day because
the amount of municipal solid
waste generation is going up and
the life o f landfills is becoming
short; setting up new landfills
is difficult because o f public
opposition.
In the USA, we are
producing an average of 6.09 lbs.
of waste per capita per day and in
1990, a total am ount o f 190
million tons of municipal solid
waste was generated. This figure
is alm ost double the am ount
generated in 1960 and is rising at
a rate of slightly over one percent
per year (Office of Technology

A ssessm ent. Facing A m erica’s
Trash: What Next for Municipal
Solid Waste. Washington D.C.,
1989). Across the country, the
cost o f solid waste collection,
processing and disposal is the
fourth highest category of
m unicipal
budgets.
The
Environm ental
Protection
Agency (EPA), state and city
authorities and private companies
are investing money to find out
the
best solution
to the
m anagem ent
problem s
of
m unicipal solid waste. Upon
discussion, the Madison County
Solid
Waste
C oordinator
concluded that increasing the
w aste
collection
bill
per
container is the only way to
reduce
the
generation
of
municipal solid waste. To control
the m unicipal solid waste
management problem, the EPA
adopted an integrated solid waste
management hierarchy composed
o f the following elements: source
reduction,
recycling,
waste
combustion and land filling. The
main objectives of the hierarchy
is the reduction o f m unicipal
solid waste generation and the
extension of landfill life. To solve
the m unicipal solid waste

problem ,

was found that

d id n ’t
think
about how it
might be a way
to reduce the

of

A study was carried out on generation. The average use of

majority of research involves
finding ways to reuse, recycle

generated due to the use of paper
tow els, w hich is about 1.05
percent o f total municipal solid
w aste generating (2225) per
capita per year. The results of
economic analysis (see graph)
show s a big financial benefit
from the use of handkerchiefs.
The cost for paper towels is
$39.21 for the same period, yet
by using handkerchiefs, it is
possible to minimize the rising
rate (1 percent per year) of
municipal solid waste generation.
The amount that could be saved
is $36.60 for each member of the
family per year. There may be
some questions that arise. For
exam ple, handkerchiefs need
frequent washing. Yes, but if we
are willing do a little extra work
in response to our feelings and
responsibilities to the problems
of the nation then there will be no
question
concerning
the
conservation of the environment
nor the survival o f the next
generation.

Letters to the e d ito r--------------------------------------------------------SIUE workers defend themselves against claims of incompetence
In response to Ellen Cottingham ’s comment about the
icy walkways, (“Ice, Ice Everywhere..., Jan. 13, 1998”),
Facilities M anagem ent is divided into different
departments with different responsibilities and duties.
Ellen, icy walkways are handled by the “Grounds and
Moving Service.” Janitors (excuse me) “Custodial
Service” or “Building Service Workers,” maintain the
interior of University buildings. Also, “Grounds and
Moving Services” are provided with the proper clothing
and footwear for working outside. The several people you
watched drinking coffee were probably part of “Building
Services Workers” and are responsible for the safety of
SIUE students and employees inside the buildings. If
yo u’re confused about the reason why the tuition
continues to increase, try getting involved in the Student
Governm ent, the U niversity Center Board or the
University Housing Committee. And I do agree, the
university probably needs to budget more money, so that
we can have the “Grounds and Moving Service” provide
around the clock safety outside. If you really want to get

Tonya Griffin
Student Worker, “Facilities Management”
Sophomore, Early Childhood Education
In response to Ellen Cottingham’s Letter to the Editor
in the Jan. 13, 1998 issue of the A lestle, “Ice, Ice
Everywhere...,” we would like to clarify some of the
incorrect information in her letter. First of all, ice and
snow removal is done by grounds personnel. Custodians
(janitors) have nothing to do with snow and ice removal.
Grounds personnel which once numbered in the 20s is
now down to a crew of seven with more roads, buildings

and parking lots to take care of. On the morning in
question, we started at our normal time as we were not
called out early. The crew is on call-out basis after normal
working hours. The workers seen drinking coffee were
custodial personnel and had not yet started their shift. We,
the grounds workers, put in hong hours (16, 20 or 24 hour
shifts) during snow and ice storms. With our crew down
to so few, we doubt that your rising tuition costs are due
to us. Two of our crew are currently tuition paying parents
and we do not want to see abuse of our tuition dollars any
more than Ellen Cottingham. We feel we do a good job
with the personnel available. It wotild be nice to receive a
pat on the back once in awhile instead of constant
criticism. We do our best.

Springer----------from page 8

Wilkos said he uses necessary
force when he intervenes
onstage. “This last show, a
woman was grabbing hair, and
women are hard to separate. But,
if you apply pressure to the wrist,
they’ll let go,” Wilkos said.
Being on the show has also
aided him at his other job as a
patrolm an. “I got a call last
night, dom estic, the whole
family is fighting. And we got
there and they’re like, ‘Oh,
you’re on Jerry!’ and they forget
about their problems. They want
to know if they can get tickets, t-

shirts, all that. I t’s kind of
making me a m ini-celebrity,”
Wilkos said.
W ilkos’ primary job on the
show is to protect Springer. But,
would he take a bullet for his
boss? “O f course I w ould,”
Wilkos said. “For one, Jerry’s
been very good to me, and not
too m any policem en get to
appear on a national TV show.
Second, I take a chance o f taking
a bullet everyday when I go to
work. So, o f course, I’d take one
for Jerry.”
Schultz defends the show

against accusations that it’s trash
television. “T hat’s what people
want to see. W e’ve always been a
wild, crazy show,” Schultz said.
“It’s fun now, let’s ride the wave
and see how long we can ride it.”
As a final thought, the “Jerry
Springer Show ” encom passes
many unique elements onstage
and backstage. Sure, it can be
wild and even a little bit trashy.
But, it never takes itself too
seriously. And it always ends on
a positive message from Jerry:
“Take care o f yourself, and
each other.”

scenes look at America’s
■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
The tension has peaked. The audience
is hungry for blood. A terrified young man
is about to tell his perky girlfriend that he
has not only been cheating on her for the
last four months, but it has been with a
(gasp) m ember of the opposite sex. She
responds with a sharp siap to his face. The
mob cheers, and thus begins the well-oiled
m achine that is “T he Jerry Springer
Show.”
Ratings for the popular talk show have
soared in the last year, and frequently give
Oprah, the top-rated syndicated talk
show, a run for the money.
Much o f its success has
to do w ith the
outrageous nature
and o f course,
the
hard
working staff
behind the
scenes.
T h e
a u d ie n c e
for
the
show
is
warmed
up
and
led, like a
pack
of
l o y a l
sheep,
by
Todd Schultz,
stage m anager
and
post
p r o d u c t i o n
supervisor.
“You see me
because
I ’m

breaking up fights, telling the audience
what to expect, when they need reaction,
stuff like that ... I give instructions to be
loud and obnoxious, but only when I ask
them to,” Schultz said.
Schultz came to the show in early 1994
as a production assistant and became stage
manager in April, 1995. He leads the
audience in “oohs” and “ahhs” for added
drama on the show, and quiets them when
their chants of “Jerry, Jerry” carry on too
long. He is also the last person to see the
show before airing, and has the job of
m eticulously bleeping all o f the foul
language that the guests spew.
Guests on “The Springer Show”
have to sign various waivers in
order to appear. One states
that if a guest is not
telling the truth
they could be
liable for the
cost o f the
episode,
ar ound
$80,000. If
■ guest is
going on
to
find
out
a
surprise, a
v e r y
popular
“S p rin g e r”
show style,
they have to
read and sign
a list o f 20
possible
surprises.

Surprises range from a reunion, to
finding out that their girlfriend is a man.
They also have to sign a waiver saying
their likeness on video can be used for
anything, including appearing in videos
like Springer’s “Too Hot For TV!”
Some of the guests need special care
before a taping begins. For any
television program
m ake-up and
wardrobe is used and the “Springer”
show is no different. According to a
production assistant, some guests arrive
with missing teeth, and can be sent to the
dentist, per request. White-out is used for
guests who have gold teeth.
Once the taping starts, Steve Wilkos
job begins. He is the director of security
for the show, and a Chicago police
officer on the side.
“I’m almost like an audience member,
except I interact if there’s a physical
confrontation,” Wilkos said.
Wilkos said his favorite type of show
is the relationship show that they do all
of the time
“The show was successful [before],
but now it’s really taking off,” Wilkos
said. “I think it’s the nature of the show.
We do relationship shows. They’re very
confrontational. They’re very explosive,
and I think people want to see that. And
I think it’s something that people can
relate to.”
Wilkos hires other Chicago police
officers for the show if needed. “If w e’re
doing a KKK show or having 20 guests
and it might get confrontational, I bring
in other officers for assistance,” he said.

Not Too Hot’, not too cold
■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
Success in the entertainment industry
inevitably
m eans
one
thing:
merchandising.
“The Jerry Springer Show ” is no
different. Lately, commercials have aired
during the show hawking a video tape
entitled, “Jerry Springer: Too Hot For
TV!” The tape promises to feature clips
that are too racy and outrageous to air on
regular television.
The claim is mostly true, but the results
are a bit disappointing. The tape features
45-m inutes o f clips from episodes of
“Springer.” Most of the clips feature fights
from the popular relationship shows,
which don’t seem any more outrageous
than the normal episodes (which are
outrageous, but free).
The rest of the tape contains clips which
feature partial female nudity. These are
the only parts of the tape that could
actually be construed as “Too H ot.”
Besides being funny, they could also be
construed as sexist.
The show would have been more
honestly marketed as a “Greatest Hits”
(get it — fights, hits) collection. All in all,
for die-hard Jerry fans, or those looking for
a fun party tape, it’s worth the $20.

SPORTS REPORTER
The w om en’s basketball team
is packing away their home
colors after edging W isconsin
Parkside and losing to Lewis
University in the last two games
of a four game home stretch.
Last Thursday, the C ougar
wom en hosted a W isconsinParkside team who were 1-6 in
the conference and 2-12 overall.
SIUE was down at the end of
the first half due to a defense that
was full o f holes. The non­
capacity crow d w atched the
Rangers run an offense that
centered from the post to passes
on baseline. Parkside made the
cuts, got the rebounds and had
the Cougars down 40-30 going
into the locker room.
“I told them that we can’t
afford to spot teams a lead and
then come back in the second
half,” Cougar head coach Wendy
Hedberg said. “We seem to have
that type of game with Parkside
every year.”
The second half struggle for
SIUE started with defense and
rebounding. Each team played
w ell on the boards with
P arkside’s _ Katie
M orrissey
pulling down 10 and SIU E’s Kim
Lowe, having a Dennis Rodman
type night, fighting for 19
rebounds. Eight o f the boards
were on the offensive end.
SIUE picked the defense up
and paid the price. Leslie Phillips
and Misi Clark fouled out, but
not before Clark knocked down
two crucial free throws to put the

game into extra minutes.
“We
definitely
w eren’t
w orking hard on defense,”
H edberg said. “Our problem s
throughout the game were all
basic, fortunately we came
back.”
In the final minute of
overtime, SIUE guard Erica Cory
hit two free throws to make it 7370 and then made a long pass up
court to a wide open Christina
Loomis. Loomis got fouled on
the play and went to line to nail
down the game. She missed two
and the score stayed at 73-72 and
Parkside got a chance to end it.
With some six seconds on the
clock, Parkside inbounded the
ball and made their way up court
The ball went into the hands of

Heather
Bogenschneider.
A questionable call, which
was commonplace in this contest,
arose when Bogenschneider was
fouled at the buzzer. The referees
said it was after the clock read
zero.
Clark led all scorers with 22
points and three assists. Alicia
Harkins, Erica Cory and Kim
Lowe all ended in double figures.
Parkside had three players in
double digits with Bogenscheider
putting in 16 and generously
giving out nine assists.
S aturday’s game had SIUE
against a Lewis University team
that is now 6-2 in the conference
after beating the Cougars 86-76.
The loss for the Cougars was
not without effort. Four SIUE

Kellie Harmas combined for 53
points and kept the Cougars on
the downside of their 12 point
halftime deficit.
“We couldn’t leave those two
players alone,” Hedberg said. “If
we did they’d shoot the three, and
if we pressured them they would
drive and get fouled.”
As a team, the Flyers shot 51.1
percent from the floor and 86.1
percent from the free throw line.
Harmas hit 11 of 13 and Jewell
hit 9 o f 10 from the charity stripe.
Clark went 4 of 8 for SIUE

put in some good work on the
glass having more of a Charles

“Offensively we played good.
We need to convert free throws
and some of our players need
to shoot a little more,” Hedberg
said.
The Cougar women are going
to tackle a tough schedule for
their four game road trip starting
on Thursday with Indianapolis.
