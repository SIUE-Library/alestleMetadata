Region II program. The program, associated with the United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc.,
came to SIUE Tuesday to participate in Region II boys soccer camp. The camp included young boys
from all other the Midwest and northern Midwestern region, with boys from fourteen states.

SIUE housing director, Michael Schultz
released a letter, via university email, this week
detailing the newest feature in SIUE’s current

Williams retires after 25 years of service as campus police captain
■
BY RAY
THOMPKINS, JR.
FOR THE ALESTLE
After 25 years of service,
Edward A. Williams of the
Campus Police Department
says
“good-bye”
to
the
SIUE community.
Williams began his career
with the SIUE police back in
1974. John Rendleman, the
chancellor at that time, was
laying the groundwork for

Edward A. Williams
an SIUE that
grow today.

continues

to

Williams remembers those
days well and spoke candidly
about the years he spent helping
make SIUE a safe place to work
and study.
Williams
experienced
many exciting and valuable
experiences as a police officer
at SIUE.
“It was back in 1974,”
Williams said, recalling his first
day on the job when two armed
bank robbers walked away from
the Bank of Edwardsville with
$50,000. Along with this

incident,
Williams
also
remembers when the SIUE
campus hosted the infamous
“Mississippi River Festival,” an
event which headlined national
recording acts and attracted
crowds numbering up to an
estimated 35,000.
“Those experiences were
unforgettable, and I wouldn’t
exchange them for anything,”
Williams said.
Williams possess a desire to
help others that he was able to
fulfill in his work, and hopes to

continue to fulfill in the future.
“I’d like to help today’s
youth, either by counseling or
coaching high school athletics.”
SIUE chancellor, David
Werner, and his wife and
family, along with various
members of the campus and
community, helped bid him
farewell in his retirement.
Although Williams admits,
he’s retired on paper only, hoping
to always remain active.

Teens today start smoking for the same reason teens always have: it’s cool
AURORA, 111. (AP) — Smoking is stinky, hazardous
and expensive, but the one thing it has going for it no
legislator or parent can extinguish: It’s cool.
Smoking was cool 50 years ago when Lee Spieler
transferred to a city high school in Pittsburgh. And
cigarettes were still cool nine years ago when Ira Potter
asked the big brother he idolized for a smoke.
Spieler is a 60-something mother of three who
gardens and power walks. Potter is a 19-year-old who
loves Frisbee golf, Gatorade and heavy metal music.
So different in many ways, except in the way they
feel about smoking. Both started as teen-agers. Both now
detest the habit. Both don’t want to be smokers. Spieler

succeeded in quitting almost 15 years ago. Potter is
still trying.
Though they're two generations apart in age, Potter
and Spieler’s smoking stories are strikingly similar.
Fashions come and go, but a teen-ager’s desire to act and
look like an adult is nothing new.
Spieler was 16 when she took her first puff.
“I was a cheerleader and [in] the in crowd smoked. So
I tried it, and before I knew it I was smoking.
Weight gain is one of the reasons a lot of teens don’t
want to quit smoking once they start, Spieler, who
researched teen smoking while she was a board member
for the American Cancer Society, said.

“We have to face the fact that nicotine burns
calories,” she said.
Teens have to be taught how to exercise and eat right
so they can minimize weight gain when they quit, she
advised. Those are the kinds of issues authorities should
be looking at, not banning cigarettes, hiking the price or
blaming tobacco companies, Spieler added.
“What have you ever priced out of the market for
kids? They wear $150 Nike’s. Poor kids do, too. They’ll
steal them if they have to. It’s a dope. It’s a form of dope.”
She offered another solution to curb teen smoking.

Prosecution’s case falters in racial beating
CHICAGO (AP) — When
three young white men were
accused of beating a black 13year-old who had ventured into a
mostly white neighborhood, the
outlines of the case seemed clear.
Even President Clinton spoke of
a “savage, senseless assault
driven by nothing but hate.”
Sixteen months later, though,
prosecutors are struggling simply
to bring the case to trial.
One key witness is dead and
another is the target of a
nationwide manhunt. The trial
has been delayed twice, and
Illinois’ speedy-trial law presents
prosecutors with a looming
deadline to bring the defendants
to trial or turn them loose.
While city leaders from
Mayor Richard M. Daley on
down insist the prosecution will
go
forward,
some
black
leaders are afraid the politically
and racially charged case is
falling apart.
“I think there's a little bit of
apprehension in terms of the
witness not being available and
his whereabouts not being
known,” Rep. Danny Davis, D111, said.
At the center of the case is a
boy who was apparently looking
for a basketball game and instead
became a symbol. Lenard Clark
rode his bicycle across a racial
dividing line on March 21, 1997,
traveling from his home in an all­
black housing project into the
adjacent,
mostly
white
Bridgeport neighborhood near
Comiskey Park.
There he was beaten,
allegedly by Frank Caruso, 19;
Michael Kwidzinski, 21; and

Victor Jasas, 18, all Bridgeport
residents. Police said Clark
was attacked because he was
black. All three defendants
were charged with attempted
murder, aggravated battery and
hate crimes.
Each of them could get up to
41 years in prison if convicted on
all charges.
Clark recovered from the
beating, but cannot remember it.
So prosecutors expected to rely in
large part on the testimony of
Richard DeSantis, 19, who is
believed to have seen the attack.
But DeSantis’ family moved
from Chicago to Scottsdale,
Ariz., and DeSantis himself has
been missing for months, forcing
two delays in a trial that was
scheduled to begin in April.
Police and FBI agents are looking
for him.
Another witness, Michael
Cutler, was fatally shot in May in
what police said was a gangrelated robbery attempt unrelated
to the Clark case.
The trial is now scheduled to
begin August 7. At that point,
state law would allow Cook
County State’s Attorney Richard
Devine to request a further delay
of only 60 days.
Devine expects to bring the
case to trial even if DeSantis is
not found, spokesman Bob
Benjamin said. “We think we
have a case that we can take to
court, with or without this
witness,” he said.
The case became more
complex last week when the
Chicago Sun-Times quoted
unidentified law enforcement
officials as saying that the fathers

SMOKING --------

toxic chemicals he's inhaling
every day.
“I might as well wrap my
lips around a muffler,” he said.
“It’s all carbon monoxide
and a bunch of chemicals.”
Parents, too, are worried
about the growing number of
teens smoking. Maria Garcia
doesn’t smoke, but her 11-yearold son does. Like millions of
parents around the country,
Garcia is concerned, and she
doesn’t know what to do.
“I keep telling him not to and
I really worry about it,” the
Aurora woman said. “My mother
died of lung cancer. He doesn't
remember it, but she went
through a lot of pain. He was only
5 years old.
“When she was dying it was
terrible — she couldn’t breathe.
It was like somebody was
choking her.”
Adults
smoke
because
they’re addicted. Kids smoke for
more
complicated
cultural
reasons, Kenneth Kissler, a
psychologist
at
Apogee
Psychiatric Care in Aurora, said.
Kids say to themselves,
“This is an accepted thing, and if
I don’t do it I’m odd man out,”

from page 1

“Kids have to really talk to
people who have had a lung
removed, and they have to talk to
people who are dying.
“You're never going to stop
teen-agers from experimenting.
That’s part of being a teen-ager.
Why do they have sex without
protection? And why do they
commit so many suicides? Teen­
agers are a breed in themselves."
Potter puffed on his first
cigarette at the tender age of 10.
He was in the garage with his 13year-old brother.
“I’d always try to act like
him and be like him,” he said.
The
teen’s
parents
discovered he was smoking when
he was about 12.
“My dad wanted me to write
an 11 -page paper on the effects
of smoking and lung cancer,”
he said. “He even gave me
a deadline.”
Potter procrastinated until
his father forgot about the paper.
Potter now wishes he had
fulfilled his assignment. It’s
only been in recent years that
he’s learned about all the

of both witness DeSantis and
defendant
Caruso
were
associated with organized crime.
Chicago Crime Commission
Executive Director Thomas
Kirkpatrick pointed to a report
published by the commission
last year listing Caruso’s father,
also named Frank Caruso, as a
labor-union associate of the
Chicago mob.
Caruso is an official of
the Laborers’ Union, described
by the Justice Department as
a mob-dominated group. But
Kirkpatrick also noted that
Caruso
was
not
among
those ousted in a recent
housecleaning designed to rid the
Chicago Laborers Council of
mob influence.
Caruso defense attorney Ed
Gensen would not comment on
the case or on the allegations
concerning the elder Caruso.
The Sun-Times described
DeSantis’ father, also named
Richard DeSantis, as being
involved in organized crime as
well. It noted that the elder
DeSantis was convicted of
gambling six years ago.
A Scottsdale phone number
for the elder DeSantis was
disconnected at week’s end. The
Sun-Times reported that he was
reached
at his home there and had
<9
no comment.
Davis said that despite black
community concern about the
future of the case, he believes that
it will go to trial, and that Devine
will put on a strong case.
To put on a weak case, Davis
said, is “too risky for him
politically, and it’s too risky for
the community as a whole.”
Kissler said.
“What we need to do is make
it not a cool thing and not a
glamorous thing to smoke. It has
to be something that’s not
exciting. As we begin to chip
away at the glamorous image, we
will reduce the percentage of
people who smoke. Right now,
it’s like a little factory, as the
adults quit the teens start.”
The solution to the teen
smoking dilemma seems to he a
matter of approach, Denise
Palumbo, chair of Lindenhurst
Committee on Tobacco Use, said.
The committee formed
last summer to tackle teen
smoking. At first, the group
considered
crafting
local
ordinances to fine teens caught
smoking and require them to do
community service. Teens who
talked to committee members
said cracking down on kids won’t
get them to stop smoking.
“It’s a lot more complicated
than we originally thought,”
Palumbo said.
The key is to somehow get
kids to realize what adults
eventually learn, said Palumbo,
who was a teen smoker, herself
before she quit in her 20’s.
“You think you look so cool
and grown up, and in fact you
look ridiculous.”

Mirror, mirror: what we don’t see
is as important as what we do see
Where was all this “Mulan” and stuff like that when I was growing up? Parents often
don't realize what their children don’t see on television affects them just as much as what they
do. They often don’t notice the more subtle forms of brain washing performed on their children
by their teachers and peers.
Some effects are obvious. When my cousin was five his favorite show was “Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles,” therefore he ran around my grandmother’s house kicking people. This is
Danie/lo a very obvious effect television has on some children, but it isn’t across the board. My sisters
Belton and 1 loved “Voltron,” (which to this day 1 still believe that “Power Rangers” is a live action
version of “Voltron”), but that didn’t make us want to be like the characters on “Voltron.” (Wait,
1 take that back: my little sister did want to be the princess on “Voltron.”) Which brings me to a much larger
issue.
Growing up, 1 had some pretty skewed perceptions of white people. Not like some of you readers are
thinking; I grew up believing white people were perfect. I lived in a nearly all black suburb, all my friends
were black, everyone in my family was black, I went to a black church, and I attended a black school with
white instructors. Therefore, my only interaction with white people came from television. And on television,
there were only white people. Sure there was Fat Albert, but everyone was ugly on “Fat Albert.” I wanted
to be pretty, and I didn’t want to look like them. In other words, I didn’t see any black people on television
for the most part when I was growing up, and I, like most of us who grew up in the eighties, watched a lot
of television.
I remember that I didn’t understand that the people I made up in my imagination could be black. It never
occurred to me to make up black characters or to draw black people. Sure, when I drew myself I was black,
but in my coloring books, I colored all the people white. I remember the reason why I did was because it
was a Barbie coloring book, and on the cover the Barbie was white and blonde with blue eyes. Therefore
growing up, that was what I was measuring beauty by, because I believed that was the way it was supposed
to be. After all, they wouldn’t have made her white on the cover if she wasn’t meant to be white.
My father seeing this one day asked if he could color with me. And I said sure, because I loved to draw
and color, and my father was a very good artist as well. He colored his Barbie brown with black hair, and I
proceeded to wear out the peach colored crayon on my Barbie. Then I remember looking over and noticing
that my father’s Barbie was brown with black hair. And my father said to me, “Now Danielle, isn’t she
pretty?” And I remember thinking, “Yes, she is so pretty,” and then thinking at the same time, “You can color
them in something other than white?” As a kid, I was a big rule person. If there was a certain way things
were, I never thought you could change it if you didn’t like it.
After realizing a black Barbie was just as pretty as a white one, I began to color all my Barbies black,
because I thought that made them prettier than the ordinary ones I colored before, but this didn’t change the
effects of television totally. I still thought white people were perfect up till I went to junior high. I might not
have thought that if everywhere I looked I wasn’t told that black people were awful. At school we were told
at least every other day how we were the worst school in the Hazelwood school district, that we were awful
children and kids in other schools (those other school being mostly white) were better behaved. Then there
was the fact that I knew no actually white people my age till I enter the gifted program in Hazelwood where
I was one of the ten black people there out of the entire section for the fifth and sixth grade. That only
reinforced my belief that all white people were smart. I remember that I still didn’t understand racism then.
Majority of the kids in Galactic didn’t speak to me, and I was obviously different. But 1 didn’t think much
of it. No one at my home school spoke to me either. Then there was the teacher that almost got happy every
time I missed class so she could give me and F for the day when I was home with chicken pox. She was the
one that always lost everything and forgot that I was sick all the time. But she never seemed to forget the
other children. She seemed nice. I couldn’t see what the problem was. My mother knew better. And if she
had known that I had the most distorted vision of what black and white people were, she would have set me
straight. But I never talked to her about it till I was older.
I used to wish I had smaller lips and blue eyes. I used to think all white people were like “Family Ties”
and “Three's Company.” I guess it’s kind of like how due to syndicated American television, most foreigners
think all Americans are like “Melrose Place" and “Baywatch.”
But I was finally set straight in tire seventh grade. I had a friend named Naomi who was white. She
almost fit the profile . She was blonde and very nice. Then I saw her report card. She had four D's; I had
three A’s. I would be lying if I didn’t say I was beyond shocked, but that was how warped I was at the time.
It’s like north wasn’t north anymore, like it was east now or something. That was the beginning of the end
of my wide-eyed naivety. Within six months my family would leave our old neighborhood for one filled
with white people, and it slowly dawned on my that white people were pretty and ugly, smart and
dumb, just like black people. In some aspects they were just like black people, and some days worse than
black people.
It was one of the many times in my life I would be wrong about something. But if you thought me
comprehending race was funny, you should hear how long it took me to understand sex.
But that’s a whole other story.

Letters to the editor
U .S’s World Cup Exit
How to explain the United
States’ 2-1 loss to Iran in soccer
and its embarrassingly early exit
from the World Cup?
The United States became
the fifth team to be eliminated
from the field of 32, joining such
other athletic superpowers en
route home as Jamaica, Japan,
South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
To say that soccer is not
a big-deal sport in America
is to rely on a tired, worn-out
rationalization. We Americans
must
view
the
loss
in
broader terms.
The
Iranians
were
sportsmanlike and gracious in
their victory, which was also a
triumph for the moderate, proWest policies of new President
Mohammed Khatami. Iran also
became the first Asian team to
win a World Cup game, a much
needed morale boost for a region
beset by financial crises and
nuclear testing.
Think of the loss not as a
sports defeat but as a foreign
policy victory.

Federal Tobacco
Legislation
The
demise
of
the
federal tobacco ill is bad news
for Oregon.
The measure that the U.S.
Senate scuttled last week would
have allowed the Food and Drug
Administration
to
regulate
nicotine, restricted tobacco
advertising aimed at youth and
penalized tobacco companies if
teen smoking failed to decline
substantially.
In addition, millions of
dollars would have flowed
to Oregon and other states
for
tobacco-education
and
health programs.
Oregon now loses all those
powerful tools, which could have
helped thousands of Oregon
teens and adults quit smoking
each year.

In addition, emboldened by
their victory in the Senate, the
tobacco companies may be even
more aggressive in fighting
existing anti-smoking or tobacco
education programs in Oregon
and elsewhere.
Oregon voters can do their
part by keeping a close eye on
political donations this year to
see which candidates and causes
are backed by tobacco interests.

Shorter School Days
Irritable teen-agers have a
new champion, and it isn't a
misunderstood rock star or a
gangsta rapper.
It’s U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a
California Democrat who thinks
American high school classes
begin way too early. She has
introduced
legislation
to
encourage school districts to
delay those classes after 9 a.m.,
because she thinks rising as early
as 5 a.m. to beat a 7 a.m. bell is at
odds with the national circadian
rhythms
of
American
adolescents.
Stanford University sleep
researcher William Dement,
who supports Rep. Lofgren’s bill,
maintains that students’ body
clocks change at puberty.
They tend to remain alert late at
night and are drowsy in the
early morning.
Rep. Lofgren's legislation,
dubbed the “Z ’s to A’s bill,”
would not shorten school hours,
but it would offer grants of up to
$25,000 to help school systems
defray the cost of shifting to an
academic day that begins a
couple of hours later.
Sure, it’s a drag to get out of
bed at dawn. But rather than ask
parents, teachers and younger
adults to revamp their own
schedules to
accommodate
sleepy teens, there’s a simpler
solution: take a nap.

h íY/i the reigning king o f adult cinema:

Ron Jeremy has had quite an Teaching, or F.A.R.T. That I made up, but
illustrious career fo r a man whom some I actually was a teacher.
What subject did you teach?
would call a smutmonger.
Special education. I got a degree in
He has appeared in over 1,500 adult
films, directed John Wayne Bobbit is his special ed., a degree in education and a
life story, had roles in film s like “Killing degree in theater. So I taught special ed.,
Zoe,” and the upcoming “Orgasmo,” and I was a sub for regular education.
W hat m ade you get out of the
done stand-up comedy and taught high
school kids. All this with a hairy back teaching business?
I wanted to act all my life. I had to give
and a protruding gut.
Jeremy unleashed the low down on it a shot now. Teaching was an ace in the
the world o f skin flicks and celebrities hole, and I was doing too much of that. I
wanted to act. I starved Off-B roadway
during his recent visit to St. Louis.
What convinced you that the adult
film industry was the career for you?

Nothing really convinced me. I was
doing theater in New York and saw how
horrible the job market was. It’s so
difficult for actors to get jobs acting, so I
did “Playgirl” magazine when I had
something called a waist in 1978 and went
out to make adult movies. And now I get
offers from “Field and Stream” magazine.
They want me to be a beached whale. I’m
kidding. It’s a joke.
How did the ladies treat you in
high school?

Pretty good. I was in a lot of plays. I did
a lot of theater in high school, like a lot of
actors did when they were young. I was
actually doing a lot of studying. I got a
masters degree. I went to Queens College.
I got a teacher’s license. There’s an
organization of Fathers Against Ron

T -rid eij/.

and saw what it was like to be an actor
that makes no money. Pom was a thing I
could at least make money at while I was
doing it.
So, where did the
“Hedgehog” come from?

nicknam e

Hairy back. Bill Margold thought it up.
A1 Goldstien from “Screw” magazine’s
trying to change it. I was swimming in his
pool. I can swim really well under water. I
can go many minutes under water, and I
can do fancy dives, a lot of fancy flips off
the diving board. And I’m a Pisces. So he’s
changing my name from Hedgehog to
Manatee. He thinks I’m a fat, ugly fish
creature that’s in danger.
Is there anything you wouldn’t do in
a movie?

Uh, you. I don’t do guys. Nothing
wrong with it. I just don’t get a rise in my
Levis for it.
do

What
you

consider

a lot. Not so
much advice. He
was asking me a
1
o
t
about the porn
business. Me and
Veronica Hart,
who’s also in the
film (she plays
the judge) had
a s k e d
him about the
character
The
Colonel, which
doesn’t exist in
out business, the kiddie pomographer. He
wanted to put it in. You know he didn’t
have to be politically correct.
The whole cast was great. I hung out
with Mark Wahlberg a bit, Burt Reynolds.
The only one that was a bit weird, nice but
weird, was Heather Graham. She was a
little uncomfortable with the whole thing.
Julianne Moore was great. She’d be on the
set watching a sex scene, laughing,
cracking jokes the whole thing. But
Heather Graham, from what I understand
was not all the innocent in Hollywood
either. She was looking at me like I
belonged in a museum. Whenever I’d see
the cast like a year later, we’d be at the Sag
Awards or something, they’d always give
me big hugs hello. And Heather would too,
but she’d look at me like I'm a museum
piece. I felt like saying, “Hey, fu*k you.
I’ve got six years of college, more than
you’ve got.” But I never said that to her.

romantic?

W hat kind of crazy sex stories did
Rodney Dangerfield share with you?

Flowers, a nice
c a r p e t ,
fireplace,
beautiful
scenery, and
your mom. I
had to ruin it,
didn’t I?

His funniest joke with me, true story. 1
took him to the Erotic Awards in Las
Vegas. And we go to these parties. All
these goddamn parties are all men. There
are a few porn stars in the room and like
30, 40 guys. So Rodney goes, “Hey I love
your party Ron. There’s 10 guys for every
guy.” That’s an exact quote from Rodney.

What
kind of advice
did you give to
Paul Thomas
Anderson
[director

Nights”]?

H
e
Porn king Ron Jeremy and Lifestyle Editor Corey Stulce came to my set
demonstrate that size does matter.

do

you

run

into

All the time. That’s one of the greatest
thrills. One of the greatest advantages of
what I do is getting well-known. For
example, last week Sam Jackson on Jay
Leno gave me a great plug. And I went to
a Planet Hollywood opening in Las Vegas,
and I met everyone there, including
George Bush. Except for him, everyone

said “Hi, Ron.” No one even had to know
my name; they knew it all ready. Only
George Bush. I shook his hand, and he was
friend;y. He smiled. His wife was there
too. They had a lot of secret service people
there in Vegas. Either he didn’t know who
I was, or he acted like he didn’t know who
I was.
Describe your bedroom at home.

Messy. Posturpedic mattress. Very
comfortable bed to sleep in. I love where I
live. It’s a beautiful condo right in the
heart of Hollywood. A lot of celebrities
live there, like Sage Stallone lives there.
W hat’s the best food toy use for sex?

None. There isn’t one. I don’t buy that.
Most men don’t like to eat before sex.
Some girls do. They say girls get in the
mood after a nice dinner. Me, when I have
a nice dinner, I want to watch HBO, burp,
roll over and sleep till Spring ... I like
having sex when I’m really hungry, when
my stomach’s flatter. Skinny or heavy,
when you eat, your stomach looks a little
bigger. When you’re heavy and you eat
food, you look down and can’t even see
your di*k. I wanna see my di*k when I
have sex. Have a nice meal after you have
sex. After you make this noise,
“Ooonhahhh,” then eat. That’s when you
really get hungry too.
W hat’s the shortest am ount o f time
you worked on one film?

An hour ... Walked in, seen a pretty girl
there. She was already in make-up. I
wasn’t. You walk in, hide the bacon,
goodbye. Those are the best ones. Your
day is still free.^

This year, through the Royal D utch Soccer
Federation, H olland has sent their youth team
over, and then next year we will send a US
youth team to com pete in Holland.
The Olympic D evelopm ent Program (O D P)
of the U nited States Youth Soccer Association
identifies and trains prem ier soccer players for
the US National Teams and US Olympic Teams.
Then, from the 14 state teams, a Region II team
is selected at each age group.
These players will then move on to player
other team s in other regions for spots on the US
N ational Teams.
“It’s a feeder system,” SIU E head soccer
coach and R egion II field coordinator Ed
H uneke said in the U C Tuesday afternoon.
“C urrently the players are on state teams. That
can lead to regional team s that travel around
the world. Eventually that can lead to the
national team .”

m

H uneke also said th at this is a stepping stone
to better opportunities.
The SIU E campus has been hom e for Region
II for four years.
“SIU E and the M ET R O Soccer Club are
continuing to m ake field im provem ents to the
16 field cam pus com plex,” R egional O D P
adm inistrator, Lyle Ward said. “I think it is
im portant to do everything possible to bring in
these thousands of prom ising college-bound
students onto the SIU E campus, w here we can
provide the best com bined housing, dining and
training facilities in the M idwest.”
If players are lucky enough to advance to the
regional level, they get to travel the world and
play against other nations.
W ard, also assistant d irec to r of the
University Center, supervised regional team s at
tournam ents last year throughout the U nited
States, C oasta Rica, Holland, Belgium, France
and Spain.
The next age group will start Sunday, July 12
and go through July 17. The team s will be the ‘81
and ‘82 team s of the 14 states.
