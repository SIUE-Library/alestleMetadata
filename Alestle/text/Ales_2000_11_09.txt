Cuban government Election returns still in question
postpones SIU trip I
BY MAUREEN HAGRMAN
NEWS REPORTER
Cuban government officials
have indefinitely delayed SIU ’s
mission to Cuba two days before
the planned departure.
Thirty-one faculty members,
adm inistrators and researchers
from
SIU
Edw ardsville,
Carbondale and the m edical
school in Springfield and several
state and local officials had
planned to go on the trip to Cuba,
which was designed as a
humanitarian trip.
U niversity
spokesperson
Scott Kaiser said, “We wanted to
meet with various Cuban officials
in
governm ent
to
discuss
agriculture,
biotechnology,
education
and
establish
relationships
that
will
be
beneficial in the long run to SIU
faculty and students.”
Cuban government officials
notified SIU officials Tuesday
that “the Cuban government has
postponed the Southern Illinois

University mission trip to Cuba
due to unplanned and unforeseen
situations that have arisen beyond
their control.”
The delegation was supposed
to
leave
Thursday.
Some
members of the delegation were
to stay in Cuba for six days, while
another group was to stay for 12.
Reportedly,
the
Cuban
governm ent left hope for the
mission to be rescheduled.
“It is in the interest of the
Cuban government to have this
visit come to fruition and host the
delegation from Southern Illinois
University,” the notice said. In
addition, the notice said a new
date would be offered within 10
days to two weeks, according to
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Kaiser said he does not know
what the unforeseen situations in
Cuba might be.
“We’re hoping to re-plan at
this
point,”
K aiser
said
W ednesday. “W e’re trying to
work with people’s schedules.”

SIUE attempts to boost
minority faculty, staff
BY KATIE BENNETT
FOR THE ALESTLE
SIU E ’s
percentage
of
minority faculty is under scrutiny
after the Illinois Committee on
Black Concerns in H igher
Education reported unsatisfactory
numbers in the state’s 12 public
universities.
The com m ittee’s “report
card” showed there are only two
state institutions w here 15
percent of the faculty is AfricanAmerican. The two schools are
Chicago State U niversity and
nearby
G overnor’s
State
University.
The committee o f educators
is calling for m ore diversity
among administrative and faculty
members.
A ssistant
Provost
for
Cultural and Social Diversity
Rudy W ilson said those two
schools have a 15 percent
A frican-A m erican
faculty
because they’re so close to
Chicago.
“Chicago is 85 percent
African-American,” Wilson said.
“These
are
predom inantly
minority colleges.”
Wilson said SIUE meets the
criteria for national standards in
terms of its faculty. “The national
norm for m inority students in
predominantly white institutions

is between 12 and 14 percent and
our minority faculty is between
12 and 14 percent,” he said. SIUE
has
39
A frican-A m erican
teachers.W ilson said SIUE needs
more minorities on its staff. “The
more people you have who are
diverse, the better understanding
our students will have in the
world they’re trying to enter to
work,” he said.
According to SIUE’s 2000
Fact Book, the 1999 faculty was
5.7 percent black, non-Hispanic;
5.4 percent Asian; 1.3 percent
Hispanic; and 86.7 percent white,
non-Hispanic. The 1999 student
body was 10.9 percent black,
non-H ispanic;
0.5
percent
American Indian/Alaskan Native;
1.6 percent Asian; 1.3 percent
Hispanic; and 82.7 percent white,
non-Hispanic.
The Illinois Committee on
Black Concerns in Higher
Education
has
issued
recom m endations
on
ways
universities can boost their
minority faculty figures.
W ilson said SIU E had a
major recruiting drive last year
that resulted in hiring three

Though Werner was

FACULTY---------------------

from page 1
He said SIUE is having trouble finding new
faculty members because of the lack o f minority
students graduating with a degree in education.
“We’re competing with the private sector and
we can’t win because we can’t compete with the
salaries,’’ Wilson said. “When you start talking
about the small percentage of African-American
faculty with graduate degrees and so on, not many
are going into education because it involves
teaching, grading papers, dealing with student
conflict, working for eight hours and taking it home
with you. Why would graduate students go into
teaching when they can make $90,000 going into
the industry?”
To help recruit more minority faculty members,
SIUE works with two program s that m entor
potential faculty members. The Illinois Minority
G raduate Incentive Program and the Illinois
Consortium for Education Opportunity Program
give scholarships and grants to m inorities
continuing in higher education from the m aster’s
degree to the doctorate level. IMGIP and ICEOP
encourage students to teach in Illinois by paying
their loans after they have taught in the state for two
years.
“We have a couple of faculty members here at
SIUE who are part of that program,” Wilson said.
He will be speaking at the IMGIP/ICEOP Joint
Fellow s Conference Friday at the Sheraton
Northshore Hotel in Northbrook. The theme of the

conference is “Diversity and Collaboration: Staffing
the Future.”
SIUE is searching for a dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences and a dean o f the School of
Education. A ccording to W ilson, each search
committee chair has received a copy o f a book titled
“Successful Staffing in a Diverse Workplace” by
M aureen C. Orey. The book is designed to assist
m anagers, supervisors and hum an resource
professionals in preparing for, selecting and
retaining a more diverse workforce. Wilson said he
hopes the search com m ittee will achieve this
objective.
According to the Illinois Committee’s report
card, an increase of black faculty would help recruit
and maintain black students. Wilson said he was not
sure that statement is true because historically black
universities have white faculty members.
“I think that students are looking for a faculty
that’s sensitive and aware of them,” Wilson said.
“They don’t want to be seen as token students but
rather as a part of the total picture of the college
campus.”
He said SIUE is slowly gaining more minority
faculty members.
“The great thing about our campus is that it’s
dynamic, not static,” Wilson said. “It’s constantly
changing and evolving to reflect the 21st century’s
diverse climate.”

I was going to talk about campus life today,
but there is not much to talk about.
It seems as though students don’t care
about what’s going on at SIUE. It shows when
I’m the only student at a concert in Cougar Den
or when I go to a volleyball game and I can
count the number of SIUE students on two
hands.
I know that SIUE is a commuter campus
and people have lives outside school, but a little
support here and there won’t hurt anyone. 1
can’t say that I go to every event on campus, but I do attend the ones
that interest me. Sometimes I even have fun.
I have a question to ask everyone, and I want serious responses.
What can I,
or anyone on this campus, do
to boost campus
SIUE?
Different sporting events and programs are on campus every
week. In many cases if these programs simply stopped happening, I
don’t think anyone would even notice.
The only answer 1 w on't accept is that SIUE needs a football
team. You might as well save your time. I’ve been thinking about
football on campus for a while. At first I thought it was a great idea,
but then I realized that students don’t support the sports we have now.
Based on student support of the other teams, a football team makes
no sense.
Other than football, anything is fair game as far as I’m

concerned. I want to know what you, individually, need to spark your
interest in w hat’s happening on campus.
I look at other universities around the country and I see their
traditions and how much spirit other schools have. I really want that
here. I don’t see significant differences between SIUE and any other
school. We’re a commuter school, but if we are close enough to drive
to school every day, then we are close enough to come to the events
on campus.
Think about this. If you were on a sports team or put on a campus
program, how would you feel if nobody showed up? Honestly, put
yourself in that position. It would be as if you threw a party and none
o f your friends came.
So write me or call the sound-off line and let me know what
interests you. Our address and e-mail adress can be found at the
life
at left-hand column o f this page. The sound-off number is at the
bottom
bottom. Hopefully you'll send in some good responses. I want to
make this campus better for everyone, but I can’t do it alone. If there
is something I can do to fix the problem, just let me know.
I urge students to get out and attend campus events. Check
Campus Scanner in the Alestle or look at the kiosks in front of
buildings. Just get out and do something.
And let me know what I can do.

determine their states’ electoral ballots. The
remaining states award the whole enchilada to
the candidate with the greatest popular vote
tally.
Theoretically, up to 49 percent o f a
state’s
electorate
can
go
w ithout
representation in such a system if the
opposition candidate garners the remaining
51 percent. The Electoral College system
does not reward candidates who make strong
showings in hotly contested races - it treats
them the same as candidates who are soundly
defeated.
Another negative effect of the Electoral
College is the lack of representation it gives
third-party candidates.
In 1992, H. Ross Perot received 19
percent of the national popular vote, but not a
single electoral vote, since he failed to capture
a majority in any state. An electoral process
that completely disregards one-fifth of the
electorate cannot be called a representative
system.
The 538 votes in the Electoral College,
one for each o f a state’s congressional
m em bers and three for the D istrict of
Columbia, do not paint an accurate picture of
the American population.
Based on 1990 census data, each
electoral vote from A laska represents
approximately 112,000 eligible voters.
In contrast, each elector from New York
represents 404,000 eligible voters. It does not
take a math whiz to figure out that New
Yorkers are getting less bang for their buck
when it comes to electing the president.
Americans have proven to be capable of
directly electing their representatives and
senators. W hat is wrong with each American
finally getting an equal say in electing the
president?
California, which has only 11 percent of
the national population, holds 54 electoral
votes - 20 percent of the 270 votes needed to
win the presidency.
The candidate who captures California is
already one-fifth of the way to victory. Only
the 11 most populous states are needed to win

the election.
Federalism is an important concept that
is brought up again and again in the
Constitution. A system that allows a minority
of states to negate the vote of the 39 others is
not compatible with states’ rights.
The main defense of Electoral College
supporters is invariably that it is “what the
framers had in mind.” There is no dispute that
the writers of the Constitution wanted to keep
the ill-informed masses from directly electing
their leaders.
T heir
reasons
have
been
well
docum ented and lauded by num erous
scholars throughout the years. The Electoral
College was a solution that fit 18th-century
America well.
However, inform ation is now easily
accessible to the public through television,
newspapers, the Internet and other media. The
electoral process should no longer fear the
influence of the “ignorant masses.”
In truth, the masses have been in the
know for quite a while now.
Fortunately, America has not felt the
need to stick to the fram ers’ intentions when
it comes to other areas. If it had, the voters
Tuesday would have been all white property
owners.
The Constitution is a living document.
W hat the forefathers truly had in mind was a
document that could be adapted to address
new issues as the United States evolved.
The principles established in 1789 were
the beginnings of a new nation, not the final
blueprint.
In the end, the Electoral College it is an
antiquated
system
that
discourages
participation and distorts the will of the
people.
Two hundred years ago, it was good idea.
Today, its merits are heavily outweighed by
its drawbacks.
It is time for the American form of
government to become more representative.
It is tim e for the political elite to
relinquish its power to the people.

W hen Stephen and Gail Fine
lost their 26-year-old son Daniel
in 1998 to melanoma, a type of
skin cancer, they set out to inform
others about the disease.
In an e-m ail m essage to
C hancellor D avid Werner, the
couple wrote, “Our son would
likely be alive today if he had
received this kind of information
about a disease which is much
more common and serious than
most people realize.”
The
Fines
encourage
everyone to visit the Internet site
w w w .skincheck.org. The site
focuses on early detection of
m elanom a
through
selfexam ination. It also tells the
Fines’ story.
A 1996 survey conducted by
the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention showed 74
percent o f individuals in the 18to 24-year-old
age group had
little or no
know ledge of
melanoma.
Among the next highest age
group, 25 to 29 years old,
melanoma is the most prevalent
cancer.
The
incidence is
increasing 4 percent every year,
faster than any other cancer.

A mosaic of cultures came together
Saturday night in the M orris University
Center at the well-received International
Night ’00.
Peace and love m ingled in the air of the
Meridian Ballroom as student performers
floated, stomped and spun across the stage in
colorful traditional dress, showcasing the
cultures o f their homelands
“There was energy flowing,” said
Govinda Pai, International Student Council

w v ? rt* d

president and chair of the University Center
Board recreation committee. Pai was also
the first recipient o f the International
Student Leadership Award.
The ballroom was filled to capacity.
Extra chairs and tables had to be brought in
to accommodate the crowd. Twenty to 30
people were left standing or sitting in the
back of the room with plates and napkins
balanced on their laps

A total of 550 tickets were sold for
International Night. Twenty to 30 people had
to be turned away, according to Pai. The
people left standing will
have their money refunded.
The night began with a
flag cerem ony o f the
countries represented at
SIUE as techno artist
M oby's transic “Porcelain”
played. A dinner featuring
foods
from
several
countries was also served.
Students performed dances
and sang songs from their
native countries, and a
Chinese

was
dem onstrated
to

“Psalm.” Instructor Paula Beals categorized her work as a “tribute to
her time with the M artha Graham Dance Company.” She added this
year’s Dance in Concert will focus on the more traditional side of
Dance in Concert in its modem era. Beals has helped choreograph
Dance in Concert since 1986.
SIUE theater and dance department professor J. Calvin Jarrel
has also contributed a dream-full of his own work this year in his
medley “Through the Space of Time Sleeps the Dream.” Specially
designed costumes, lighting effects and even a fig h t sequence will
be included. This portion of Dance in Concert 2000 will be featuring
Andrew Lackey, a freshman majoring in theater performance.
Cerebral palsy has not kept Lackey from the dance floor by any
means. Instead he can be spotted at center stage with the other
dancers in Jarrel’s medley.
Choreography of this year’s performance will be complemented
by the expertise of many SIUE theater and dance program alumni
who are now professionals. Darla K. Adree, class of 1984; Mary
Ann Rund, 1986; Heather A. Reynolds, 1995; and Rachel Brady,
1993, have all tapped their creative genius in choreographing a piece
for Dance in Concert 2000. These graduates have combined their
field experience with their
education at SIUE to take
part in this year’s event.
Eighty-five years of
com bined
teaching
experience and the success
of many students in the
world of dance add to the
delight of Dance in Concert

It is time for a night at the theater. Since before 1970, the
department of theater and dance has been having its annual Dance
in Concert, and this year’s Dance in Concert 2000 promises to be
spectacular.
Performances will be modem dance numbers with some jazz
and ballet influence, with music by composers ranging from Aaron
Copland to Harry Partch. Intricately designed costumes and hightech special effects and lighting are sure to add to the excitement of
each performance.
In tribute to 25 years in the department of theater and dance,
associate professor Kerry J. Shaul has put to life one of this year’s
biggest num bers. “Silver Rem iniscing ...” will feature seven
choreography excerpts of Shaul’s work at SIUE in part through live
performance and in part as a multimedia presentatioh. “Silver
Reminiscing ... ” is a retrospective look at the joys of a career in
dance and dance instruction.
Another piece of the dance faculty’s choreography will be

2000 .
Performances will be at
7:30 p.m. Thursday through
Saturday and at 2 p.m.
Sunday in the Dunham Hall
theater. Each show will
include
a
15-minute
interm ission,
and
Saturday’s
perform ance
will feature a post-show
discussion with faculty and
performers. Tickets are $5
for students and $7 for

Veterans to lead the way for Lady Cougar team
Women's basketball team returns 11 players from last year's
squad, all-tim e leading scorer and co-Player o f the Year
BY KUMAR BHOOSHAN
ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR
Experience
makes
expectations high for the 2000-01
SIUE wom en’s basketball team.
The Lady Cougars, coming
off an 18-9 overall season and
13-7
G reat
Lakes
Valley
Conference record last year, will
be returning 11 players from last
year’s team which finished fourth
in the GLVC.
The Lady Cougars will be
led by senior Misi Clark.
Clark, the G LV C’s CoPlayer of the Year for the 19992000 season, also received
honorable m ention to
the
Daktronics Inc. Division II AllAmerica team.
Along with making her third
All-GLVC team , Clark also
becam e the all-tim e leading
scorer in SIU E history, with
1,676 points, and set the record
for career free throws made and
attempted.
A lso her 21.4 points per

game average last year was an
SIUE record, which included a
40-point game against Kentucky
Wesleyan College.
She also ranks in the top five
among Lady Cougars in six other
offensive categories.
“Misi is the best point guard
in the GLVC,” coach Wendy
Hedberg said. “We will look to
her for leadership on our team.”
SIUE will also be led by and
Crystal Gladson and Sarah Cook.
Cook, a 6-1 center, played
her sophom ore and freshm an
seasons at the U niversity of
Toledo and transferred to SIUE
where she ranked second only to
Clark with 10.7 points per game
and led the team in field goal
percentage and blocked shots for
the 1999-2000 season.
Gladson, a 6-foot senior, led
the Lady Cougars in rebounds
last year and finished fourth
overall in points per game on the
SIUE squad.
To add to the experience, this
Lady C ougar squad also has

some new faces on the team in
Kristen Boss, Jessica Robert and
Jaque Howard.
Boss, an All-State and AllConference player at Carrolton
High School, was ranked in the
top 20 among all players in
Illinois.
“Kristen is a very skilled
athlete for a player her size,”
Hedberg said. “She will see some
tim e this year but is playing
behind two seniors, so this will
be a year to get her ready for next
year.”

BY RICK CROSSIN
SPORTS EDITOR
It’s deja vu all over again for
the SIUE volleyball team in the
Great Lakes Valley Conference
Tournament.
The Lady Cougars, for the
second year in a row, will face
Northern Kentucky University in
the GLVC Tournament.
“Again,” coach Joe Fisher
said. “If not the first round, then
in the second round. You have to
get through them sooner or later.”
Since the start of the 1998
season; the Lady Cougars have
lost four straight m atches to
Northern Kentucky.
In the two team s’ only
meeting this season, Northern
Kentucky dominated, winning in
straight games by scores of 15-7,
15-7 and 15-12.
But T hursday’s m eeting
could have quite a different
outcome.
Last
season,
Northern
Kentucky came into the GLVC
tournam ent on a 21-m atch
winning streak. But this season,
the Norse com e into the
tournament in slightly different
fashion, having split their last

two conference matches of the
season.
The one loss came at the
hands of conference bottom
dw eller St. Joseph’s College,
w hom SIUE handled rather
easily earlier this season.
“I t’s unusual for them ,”
Fisher said. “I think in years past,
Northern Kentucky goes through
the
conference
schedule
undefeated and nobody really
tests them. This year is different.
“With two losses to Lewis
(University) and not playing well
against the second-worst team in
the conference and losing, it’s
unfam iliar ground for them ,”
Fisher said.
D espite
Northern
K entucky’s
vulnerability
entering the tourney, SIUE has
had its share of problems with
the Norse in the past, but Fisher
has confidence that N orthern
Kentucky is beatable.
“I think they are,” Fisher
said. “I don’t think they have the
offense that they did last season.
This year, if you play good
defense against them, that’s what
keeps you in the match.”
According to Fisher, passing
and blocking will be keys to their

m atch
against
N orthern
Kentucky.
“W e’ve got to pick up balls
that w ould norm ally hit the
floor,” Fisher said.
Unfortunately, history again
is not on SIUE’s side when it
comes to first-round games in the
tournament.
Over the past three seasons,
the Lady Cougars have only
advanced past the first round of
the tournament once, losing to
N orthern Kentucky in the
semifinals.
“I really don’t think it’s the
pressure,” Fisher said. “Honestly,
I think it’s a credit to the
competition in the conference.”
A win could put a positive
spin on w hat has been a
frustrating season.
“I think a win will make us
feel a little better about how
things have gone,” Fisher said.
“To know that things really
didn’t go our way this season, but
we can play with the best teams,
that’s the big thing.”
This year’s tournament will
be
at the
University
of
Indianapolis in Evansville, Ind.,
and SIUE’s match will start at
2:30 p.m. Thursday.

Hockey club seeks first
win of season at Wash U.
BY NEAL HAMM
•SPORTS STRINGER
Still looking for a win, the
SIUE Cougar ice hockey club
heads back to W entzville. Mo.,
to play W ashington U niversity
Friday.
SIUE is 0-4 overall this
season, but help may be on the
way.
SIUE faced Wash U. twice
last season, producing a tie and
a win.
"Last year, when we went to
play them at their place, we tied
them because we took som e
stupid penalties," team captain
Scott Cloin said. "We're a better
team than them , though. We
expect to beat this team."
Cloin said that even though
he expected a Cougar win. the
players can't be overconfident
going into the game.
"If we go to the gam e and
act (overconfident), ' they're
going to get the best o f us. but if
we go into the game and ju st
play like we know we can, then
we'll win," Cloin said.
The Cougars are trying to
forget about last w eekend as
they head into their gam e
against Wash U. at 9 p.m . at the
Wentzville Ice Arena.
Last weekend, the Cougars
saw a loss to both the University
o f M issouri-St. Louis and the
B lues A lum ni. The B lues
A lum ni gam e was a charity

game, but the Cougar loss to
UM SL was disappointing.
"We pretty much knew that
we were going to lose against
the B lues A lum ni because
they're the Blues Alumni, but we
were really hoping for a win
against UMSL," Cloin said.
L ast Saturday's gam e in
W entzville ended in a 9-2 loss
for the C ougars. The Cougars
scored in the first period as Brad
M aggio won a face-off in,
UM SL's end, passing the puck
to the point, w here Bobby
M eszaros slid it between the
legs o f the goalie.
Late in the seeond period, a
pass by Cloin to the front of
U M SL'net was met by Ty SuhreT
w ho flipped it into the goal for
the Cougars' second and final
goal of the game,
UM SL won the game 9-2
and outshot the Cougars 58-15.
Late in the third period
when the score was out o f reach
for the C ougars, the game
started to get out o f hand. With
16 seconds left to go in the
game, a fight broke out between
players on each team,
R eferee Gary Byrd, unable
to determ ine who started the
fight and who was inyolved,
gsive all five skaters on both
team s a 10-minute m isconduct
penalty. The game ended with
the clock counting down and
both goalies standing in their
nets.

Sports at SIUE slowly
becoming a family affair
BY BRANDEN PETERSON
SPORTS REPORTER
SIUE sports has become a
family tradition.
There are five sets of siblings
playing SIUE sports this season.
The m en’s soccer team alone
has three pairs of siblings.
Matt and Brian Horan have
been playing soccer together
most of their lives.
“I’ve played with him my
whole life so I came here to play
with him,” Brian Horan said.
Matt Horan, a sophomore,
started every gam e for the
Cougars this season. Brian
Horan, a freshman, played in 17
games for SIUE.
Josh and Bret Richardson are
another set of brothers on the
m en’s soccer team.
The
tw ins
w ere
AllConference at M ount Vernon
High School in Indiana.
Josh Richardson was Most
Valuable
Player
and
AllConference at M ount Vernon as a
midfielder.
Bret Richardson was also
All-Conference at M ount Vemon
and an Academic All-Stater in

goal.
W hile Josh Richardson saw
limited time on the field for SIUE
this season, Bret Richardson took
over the No. 1 goalkeeper spot
late in the season for the Cougars.
Justin and Sean Huneke are
two brothers who have deeper
ties than the other siblings on the
m en’s team.
Edw ardsville High School
graduates freshman Sean Huneke
and junior Justin Huneke are also
the coach’s sons.
For Sean Huneke, having his
older brother playing here helped
him adapt to college soccer.
“My brother taught me a lot
about college soccer,” Sean
Huneke said. “He made it easier.”
For head coach Ed Huneke,
having his sons play for him is a
great pleasure that sometimes
requires him to be reserved when
his sons do well.
“It is a nice feeling having
two o f my sons out there on the
team and especially when they
play well,” Ed Huneke said.
But the Hunekes playing at
SIUE also has its benefits.

This season, Cream er again
led the team in scoring with 10

She is ranked fourth this
season in the GLVC in that
respect. She also racked up five
assists on the side.
“C olleen,

“We had a really good
