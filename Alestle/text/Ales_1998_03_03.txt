Students and fa c u lty a t the Black Student A ssociation Renaissance Celebration
socialize before en jo yin g entertainm ent provided b y SIU E students and the su rrou n din g

As a closing for Black
History Month, the Black Student
Association presented the third
annual Renaissance Celebration
on Friday in the Redbud Room in
the University Center. The event
was a formal affair.
The program included a

variety of talent by students and
members of the local community.
According to Terrance Gaddy,
president of the Black Student
A ssociation,
this
y e a r’s
Renaissance Celebration had the
largest turnout.
“I am very enthusiastic about
the program, this is the third time
that we have done it and each
year it’s grown and becom e
bigger and better,” Gaddy said.

New music television network gets support from students
■ BY AMANDA
BARTON
NEWS STRINGER
SIUE students, who are not
allowed to vote concerning
additions of cable channels, were
given the opportunity to express
their opinions on Feb. 19, 20, 26
and 27.
Representatives from the
Much Music USA Co. were
available during these days in
the University Center Goshen
Lounge and Woodland Hall
Lobby from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and
from 4 to 7 p.m.
They were there for students
on campus to question them about

what their company has to offer.
Also they were hoping to
persuade students to sign a
petition
urging
Charter
Communications to include their
channel in its new line-up.
According to Much Music
executives, it is state of the art
music television featuring a
diverse play list with live,
spontaneous,
interactive
programming. The “all music all
the time” network provides an
unprecedented showcase for
emerging and established artists
from around the world. The
programming consists of musical
series, concerts and videos for an
eclectic audience ranging from

rock, pop, alternative, blues,
metal, rap and folk.
George Hillier, director of
Much Music’s Regional Center in
Chicago, said he talked with more
than
400
students
while
on campus.
According to Hillier SIUE
students are highly dissatisfied
with the MTV network and were
excited to hear about a station
whose main purpose is to play
nothing but music.
“No one spoke well about
MTV, many students told me they
feel as if MTV’s programs insult
their intelligence and they are
unhappy with the lack of music
they play,” said Hillier.

The Caribbean Jazz Project brings new variety of
music as part of the ongoing Arts & Issues series
■ BY RENEE H O L L E R
NEWS STRINGER
The Caribbean Jazz Project,
with it’s unique blend of
im provisational jazz,
Latin
finesse and Caribbean grooves, is
scheduled to appear Sunday,
March 8, at 4 p.m. in the
Meridian Ballroom of University
Center. The Jazz Project is being
brought to campus as part of the
ongoing Arts & Issues series for
1997-1998.
The Project will feature the
musical styling of saxophonistclarinetist Paquito D ’Rivera,

steel-pan legend Andy Narell,
and
vibist-m arim bist
Dave
Samuels. Joining the principal
trio
for
this
event
will
be pianist Dario Eskanazi,
bassist
Oscar
Stagnaro,
percussionist Luis Conte and
drummer Mark Walker.
“I’m excited about bringing
this group to Southern Illinois
because of the blending of the
various musical styles,” Arts &
Issues
Coordinator
Richard
Walker said. “They blend the
steel pans, the marimba and the
clarinet into Caribbean, Cuban,
Brazilian and Latin classical jazz.
The sound of this group is so

unique, I know our audiences
will appreciate the excitement
generated by the Caribbean
Jazz Project.”
The
Project has
been
described as
m elodic
and
percussive, explosive in spots,
while passionate and romantic in
others. The Project’s music is
about
tropical
pleasures,
seductive atm ospheres and is
easily one of the most vibrant and
dynamic ensemble interactions of
any jazz group. Together they
create as feisty a fiesta as
instrumental music can offer.
see CARIBBEAN, page 2

“I have never been more
impressed with a group of
students as I was with those at
SIUE,” said Hillier. “All of the
students I spoke with showed
much maturity and visiting the
campus was a very positive
experience for me,” Hillier said.
Lisa McKirgan, editor of
“Community News”, a housing
publication, said the petition is a
way for students to tell the cable
network what they want even
though they are not able to
officially vote on the matter.
“This is exactly how we were
able
to
get
the
Black
Entertainment Television channel
a few years ago,” McKirgan said.

“The Edwardsville com m unity
outside the campus may not think
certain things should be added,
but SIUE residents do and they
should be able to choose also.”
During the month o f March,
Much Music programming will be
shown on UHTV-6. The programs
will feature such artists as
No Doubt, Sarah McLachlan and
Jewel.
The
programs
will
preceed the 8 p.m. movies on
selected evenings.
Much Music will be available
again from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and
from 4 to 7 p.m. on March 5, 6,
and 12 in the University Center
Goshen Lounge and Woodland
Hall Lobby.

“The
Renaissance
Celebration is an opportunity for
the students and faculty to
learn more about AfricanAmerican
contributions
to
America and society as a whole,”
Nance said. “It is a celebration
of the arts, politics, economics
and education.”
Nance said that he hopes
there

a

though he is graduating he plans to
come back and see a well attended
event and a more diverse crowd.

The festivities began with
Melody
Graves
singing
a
rendition of the Black National
Anthem, “Lift Every Voice and
Sing”. There was a variety of
entertainment from SIUE students
and the surrounding community.
The
entertainm ent
included
African dances, soulful tap
dancing, short stories, songs,
poetry recitals, dramatizations and
piano concertos.
Artwork from students in the
form of oil paintings, ceramic
sculptures, figurine collections
and collages was exhibited
throughout the room.

with the group’s first CD.
According to D ’Rivera, the
group’s sound is a “melting pot,
throwing together south of the
border rhythm s from Latin
America, Brazil, the Caribbean,
Cuba and slowing it up for a
waltz or two.
“We mixed the island sounds
that Andy (Narell) plays into a
jazz language,” D ’Rivera said.
“Caribbean and Latin music
share the same roots, but are very

different. The whole thing about
interacting with the sounds of
other cultures is learning to pay
respect to the music.”
“Caribbean defines part of
what we do and jazz defines the
other part,” said Samuels.
Tickets for the M arch 8
concert are $12 for the general
public and $6 for students and are

C om m entary ------------------------------------------------------

Only Congress can declare
Perhaps the tim e has com e for the
Congress of the United states to exercise its
constitutional responsibility and declare war
on Saddam Hussein’s government. While the
American people may find it unusual to
declare war, it is a contractual responsibility
found in the Constitution. President Clinton
believes that Saddam Hussein is dangerous to
the long-term security of the United States.
Has pointed out that Saddam Hussien has
boldly used poison gas on citizens of Iraq and
Iran. He has attempted to construct nuclear
weapons. He has actually constructed
biological weapons. He has constructed and
bought missiles to deliver biological and
chemical weapons as far as 2000 miles. He is
expected to soon have missiles that can strike
anywhere in the United States. Since Saddam
Hussien has shown a willingness to use these
weapons on his neighbors, the president
believes he is ju stified in thinking that
someday Saddam Hussien might be willing to
use them on Americans.
More than half a century has passed since
FDR spoke of Dec. 7, a day “which will live
in infamy.” Since that tim e the public
seemingly has forgotten the words of its most
basic contract. The president’s constitutional
duties during war are laid out in Article 2,
Section 2, Clause 1: “The President shall be
Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy
of the United States.” But, the president’s
war-making powers are supervised by the
Congress as stated in Article 1, Section 8,
Clause 11, which states that Congress shall
have the right “To declare War (sic).” It
further states in Clauses 12 through 14 that
Congress shall “raise and support Armies, but
no appropriation of money to that use shall be
for a longer term than two years; provide and
m aintain a Navy; make rules for the
government and regulation of the land and
naval forces.” Clause 18 states that Congress
shall “make all laws which shall be necessary
and proper for carrying into execution the
foregoing powers, and all other powers vested

by this Constitution in the government of the
United States, or in any departm ent or
officer thereof.”
The president must lay out a self-evident
case requiring the use of American military
power. The Congress having heard these selfevident reasons must authorized the use of the
military by declaring that a state of war exists
betw een the U nited States and the
government of Iraq. If the president uses the
military without of a declaration of war, then
the Congress has abandoned its constitutional
responsibilities. It might as well disband and
let the president decide what other laws are or
are not to be enforced.
Since the end of World War II, American
presidents have been allowed a larger role in
deciding when and where to deploy military
assets. Military reaction time in some cases is
now so short that Congress no longer has a
moment to debate. They have given the
president, in his role as Commander-in-chief,
the War Powers Act to respond immediately
and protect American interests. But when
there is time to debate, as in the current case
of Saddam H ussein’s Iraq, the Congress
should assert its war-making role and decide
yes or no.
The Founding Fathers wished to limit the
president’s war-making ability. That is why
they gave only the Congress the power to
declare war. They also gave Congress control
of the purse strings by declaring that “no
appropriation of money to that use shall be for
a longer term than two years.” The president
must come back to Congress regularly to get
his “allowance.”
President Clinton has declared his
intention to reduce Saddam Hussein’s ability
to produce weapons of mass destruction. To
accomplish this task the press assumes that
the president will use air power and missiles
to destroy suspected m anufacturing and
storage sites. The Secretary of Defense states
at the Columbus/CNN meeting that he is not
considering the use of ground troops. The

public believes that the objective of this
military action should be to “kill” Saddam
Hussien rather than bomb his people. Yet, no
one in the “legitimate” press has thought to
tell the people that they should be demanding
that his or her congressman make a decision
and instruct the president as to which course
they have decided.
Without a national consensus, President
Clinton
and
the
members
of
his
adm inistration may soon be constantly
dogged by screaming protesters. If the war
with Iraq lasts longer than expected, the
president may find his popularity ratings
dropping fast. High popularity ratings are
currently protecting Mr. C linton from
impeachment talk.
Mr. Clinton would do well to heed the
voice o f the people. He should go to Congress
and a get a declaration. Then from the Oval
Office, get on television and tell Saddam
Hussien that he is the person doing most of
the harm to the Iraqi people. Tell the world
that he must give up his weapons of mass
destruction because we will never allow him
to use them on people ever again. Then, look
straight into the camera and tell Saddam
Hussien that unless he complies immediately,
we are coming to get him with all forces
necessary. That will have an effect. He does
not care if we kill millions of Iraqis. He does
care about his personal safety.
If the dictator of Iraq is a threat to the
well-being of the United States, then the
Congress should declare him an outlaw,
declare war, and the president should send the
military to bring him back for trial or kill him
if he resists.

Families bury victims of Florida tornadoes
APOPKA, Fla. (AP) — Penny
Hall and Kevin Taylor planned to
be together in marriage. Instead,
they were united in death, buried
side-by-side Saturday, a week
after they perished in a fierce
night of tornadoes.

More than 300 mourners came
to the funeral for the couple and
H all’s parents, Ed and Debra,
who also were killed when a
twister demolished the fam ily’s
mobile hom e early M onday
morning.

H all’s
5-year-old
daughter,
Ashley Himes, the only survivor
in the house, is hospitalized in
stable condition with a ruptured
spleen and bruised lung.
Another funeral service was
held Saturday in nearby St. Cloud
for 9-m onth-old Niles David
Bourke, who was sucked from
his father’s arms and dumped 300
feet from his mobile home.
He lay in a white casket
trim m ed w ith blue lace. The
white “Sesame Street” socks he
wore had the words, “W hy?
Why? W hy?” printed on them. A
new brown teddy bear sat beside
him to replace the one he lost in
the storm.
Karen and Guy Bourke wept
quietly for their son.
“As I tried to close the (closet)
door, the floor lifted up and threw
me against the wall and slapped
me against the ceiling. When I
woke up a half hour later, Niles
was gone and my jaw was just
hanging there covered with
blood,” Bourke said.
Bourke’s brother found Niles’
body under a pile of debris 14
hours later.
Heavy sobs punctuated the
hourlong service for the Hall
family, which opened with the
song, “The Rest is Mine,” by
country artist Trace Adkins:
“There is no guarantee w e’ll
see tomorrow, H eaven only
knows how long we have.”
The Rev. Robert Welch, pastor
of Orlando Church of God of
Prophecy, said that he stopped
earlier in the day to visit Ashley

at the hospital. She told him her
mother and grandparents had
died and were in heaven.
“She’s handling this perhaps a
lot better than us,” Welch said,
asking for silent prayer for the
brave little girl who was found
wandering dazed in the woods
after the tornadoes struck.
He read from Scripture, talked
of mortality, resurrection and
eternal life.
“Death at any hour is sad. It’s
difficult to deal with and
especially so when it comes
without warning,” Welch said.
Will Frost knelt and cradled
his arm around his wife, Barbara,
Debra Hall’s only sister.
A carpet o f white carnations
draped Penny H all’s pink casket,
which sat at the front of the
chapel between the cherry wood
caskets of her parents, each also
adorned with carnations. Floral
crosses stood among the dozens
of flower baskets.
State officials said 40 people
died when the tornadoes swept
through central Florida late
Sunday and early Monday.
Rescuers in Osceola County gave
up the search Saturday for a
missing man in Kissimmee. H e’s
believed to have been killed with
his roommates when a tornado
demolished their mobile home.
Several families buried their
dead in services Friday and
Saturday. Others spent the day
trying to secure belongings as
heavy rain moved into the area
for the first time since the
tornadoes.

Maria Quadros, manager of
the Ponderosa Park Campground,
the RV tourist park which was
nearly leveled by a tornado, said
residents were busy trying to take
cover from the thunderstorms.
“A lot of people are worried
that another tornado will come,”
she said.
After that one night of terror a
week ago, only piles o f splintered
lum ber and shattered glass
remained of the Hall fam ily’s

As the funeral for Ms. Hall
and her parents ended, a hearse
carrying Taylor’s remains from a
separate memorial service inched
by slowly through the rain. All
four were buried in a joint
graveside service at Greenwood
Cemetery in nearby Apopka.
“We have no insurance on life.
The blink of an eye and you’re

and friends
to smoke pot
arraigned
BERKLEY, Mich. (AP) — A
m other w hose teen-age son
brought friends home to smoke
and buy m arijuana during
Berkley High School lunch hours
has been arraigned on drug
charges.
Joanne Conley, 47, of Berkley,
was arraigned Tuesday on
charges of delivery of marijuana
and
contributing
to
the
delinquency of minors.
The Conley’s 15-year-old son
also is expected to be charged in
juvenile court with manufacture
and delivery o f marijuana.
O fficers raided the Conley
home Feb. 11 after five weeks of
surveillance. Eight marijuana
plants in a closet and eight
marijuana pipes — one three feet
tall — were seized, Anger said.
Investigators say as many as
30 students visited Ms. Conley’s
home daily during school lunch
hour. In a statement to police,
Conley admitted that she knew
her son was selling bags of
m arijuana,
said
Berkley
Detective Sgt. Raymond Anger.
“She told him he shouldn’t do
it,” Anger told The Daily Tribune
of Royal Oak. “But sales
continued even inside.”
Conley’s son and his friends
would smoke marijuana in the
family room and on the patio on a
nice day, police said.
Ms. Conley and her husband,
Robert, appeared in Oakland
County juvenile court on Monday
on a child neglect petition from
Protective Services but police say
the boy w on’t be taken from the
parents’ home.

posts, all the while peering with
envy into the ornate Capitol
office where two Republican
governors have presided over the
state.

candidates are testing each

tow ard a M arch 17 prim ary
showdown and a shot at ending
22 years of Republican rule.
One of them is taking a second
run at making some history of his
own: in a comeback bid, former
Attorney General Roland Burris
is trying to become the state’s
first black governor.
Burris is running against
former U.S. Attorney Jim Burns,
who made headlines fighting
gangs and political corruption in
Chicago; form er U.S. Justice
D epartm ent
official
John
Schmidt, an ally o f Chicago
Mayor Richard M. Daley; and
U.S. Rep. Glenn Poshard, whose
roots run deep into Southern
Illinois. Burris, Burns and
Schm idt all hail from Cook
County, where the remnants of
Chicago’s Democratic machine
can still tip a race.
Republican Gov. Jim Edgar

put his office up for grabs last
summer with a surprise decision
to retire at the end of his second
term in January 1999. But Edgar
warned the D emocratic Party
needs more than an enthusiastic
primary fight.
“They might be hungry for the
governor’s office,” Edgar said.
“But if you don’t have the right
candidate, they’ll be hungry for
four more years.”
The Democratic contest will
decide who will run against
Secretary of State George Ryan,
the presum ptive Republican
nominee for governor.
Burris is in the comeback role
because, as incumbent attorney
general, he lost the 1994 primary
race for governor. On the night of
his defeat, Burris made a speech
that sounded as if his political
career was over.
Only a few m onths later,
however, Burris launched a
quixotic independent bid to beat
Chicago M ayor Richard M.
Daley. He got trounced.
Despite the poor showing,
Chicago politics often split along
a racial divide, and Burris comes
with a base of minority support
that is an even more valuable
commodity in a four-man field.
Further, Burris is the only
Dem ocratic
candidate
for
governor who has won statewide
office. He served three terms as

comptroller and one as attorney
general before he failed in trying
to move up to governor. In 1984,
Burris lost a primary bid for U.S.
Senate.
Burris’ long record of having
his name before the public has
helped him connect with wouldbe voters in early public opinion
polls.
Without even advertising on
television, Burris held a 2-1
advantage over Poshard, his
closest challenger, in a Chicago
Tribune poll of 698 likely
Democratic
prim ary
voters
surveyed from Feb. 6-9.
In an early debate, the
confident Burris allow ed the
other three candidates to beat on
each other.
“I sat back, w atched and
laughed,” Burris said.
It was unclear, however, how
much Burris might be hurt by a
gaffe that surfaced last week. He
said in a speech taped and aired
several weeks ago over a Chicago
cable television channel that his
three opponents were “non­
qualified white boys.”
The statem ent caused an
uproar when W LS-TV aired a
copy of the tape last week. Burris
apologized, saying it was his
“emotional response” to critics in
the media who said he should
drop out of the race. His

opponents accepted his apology
and said it was time to move on.
Poshard has reached beyond
his downstate power base to build
a coalition. He picked up the
backing of H ouse Speaker
M ichael M adigan, D -Chicago.
And with M adigan’s critical help,
Poshard snagged the Illinois
AFL-CIO, the umbrella group for
organized labor.
Poshard has long had a strong
gun rights stance that reflected
his downstate district, but his
recent softening on that position
acknow ledges
the
anti-gun
sentiments o f the Chicago area,

where he must draw a significant
chunk of votes to win.
Poshard also is a strong
opponent of abortion while the
other three candidates are all
abortion-rights supporters. To
counter any potential backlash,
Poshard points to his work on
behalf
of
w om en-friendly
programs like Head Start and the
Women, Infants and Children
nutrition program.
Even so, Poshard’s opponents
have ham m ered him over his
abortion opposition, collecting
support from abortion rights
groups.
Schmidt, for exam ple, has
garnered the endorsement of the
Illinois chapter o f the National
Organization for Women. He also
has the backing of Dawn Clark

A l e s i l e

Netsch, the state’s former
com ptroller who was handily
defeated by Edgar after her own
come-from-behind victory in the
1994 primary.
As is often the case for Mayor
Daley, he has not given a formal
endorsement to Schmidt but has
spoken highly o f his former chief
of staff.
To varying degrees, Schmidt,
Bums and Burris trumpet their
law-and-order backgrounds.
Schmidt held the third-highest
post at the
U.S. Justice
Department, serving as a point
man in President C linton’s
program to put 100,000 new cops
on the beat.
Burns, in a 46-month tenure as
U.S. attorney in Chicago, snared
a long list of high-profile crooks

— including a string of political
figures and a roster of gang
members.
Burris touts how the General
Assembly passed legislation
during his tenure allowing for
statewide grand juries that can
pursue drug offenses anywhere in
Illinois.
All four say they have the
recipe to reverse more than two
decades
of
Democratic
disappointm ent
as
the
Republican Party methodically
knocked down gubernatorial
opponents one-by-one.
The last Democrat to hold the
job was Daniel Walker, an
independent elected in 1972 and
defeated in a primary battle four
years later after warring with
Chicago’s first Mayor Daley, the
current m ayor’s father.
That set the stage for
Republican James R. Thompson,
another former U.S. attorney in
Chicago whose lanky size, crime-

busting headlines and gregarious
persona earned him the nickname
“Big Jim .”
Thompson beat the Democrats
four times, beginning in 1976.
When he retired after a 14-year
reign that made him the state's
longest-serving governor, Edgar
stepped up from secretary of state
and beat the Democrats twice
more.
Edgar, o f course, said the
current Democratic free-for-all
will help the Republican string of
victories run to seven with a Ryan
victory in November.
“The more you have on a
ticket, the greater the chances
you have a faction within the
party that can get you enough
votes to w in,” Edgar said. " I
would say that is not always a
good omen for always being
assured you’re going to nominate
the strongest candidate for the
fall.”

Presidential hopefuls speak out about Clinton allegations
BILOXI, Miss. (AP) —
Potential Republican presidential
candidates directly attacked
President C linton’s m orality
Saturday, accusing him o f
em barrassing the nation and
withholding facts from the
public.
Conservative radio talk show
host Alan Keyes, speaking to the
1,600 delegates at the Southern
Republican
Leadership
conference, demanded that GOP
leaders in Congress force Clinton
to discuss what he called the
moral
issues
of
his
administration.
“As we stand today with a
president sitting in the Oval
Office who is m urdering the
conscience of America by telling
us that these things no longer
matter, we cannot be silent,”

Keyes said. “We must explain to
the people of the nation what is at
stake.”
Keyes, who ran for president
in 1996, said political polls and
consultants have apparently kept
Republicans from “speaking the
truth to our people ... kept us
from providing the only kind of
leadership that is worthwhile.”
Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, who also failed to get
the GOP nomination in 1996,
said he was troubled by polls
showing C linton’s approval
rating still high and by the
number of Americans who seem
to believe moral leadership does
not matter.
“What has been happening in
the Oval Office is embarrassing,”
Alexander said. “Bill Clinton is
the wrong man to have in the

White House as president of the
United States.”
Most
speakers
avoided
mentioning Monica Lewinsky by
name, and did not directly speak
about allegations that Clinton had
an affair with the former White
House intern and lied about it.
However on Friday, former
Vice President Dan Quayle
needled Clinton by joking to the
crowd that he had a new crime
proposal.
“Three interns and you’re
out,” Quayle said.
On Saturday, Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., preached
caution, saying it would be wise
for Republicans “not to be
dragged into ... this latest scandal
coming out of the White House.”
However,
Thom pson
indicated he would not stay silent

forever.
“I say if it becomes apparent
that this White House is intent on
investigating and digging up dirt
and dragging through the mire
anybody who criticizes what they
are doing, if this White House is
intent on phony claim s of
executive privilege as a means to

Two men found slain in Franklin county
ROBERTSVILLE, Mo. (AP)
— An O ’Fallon, Mo., man has
been charged in the shooting
deaths of two men here Saturday.
Rick G. Beatty, 39, was
charged with two counts of
second-degree murder, said the
Franklin
County
sh eriff’s
department. Beatty was being

held in the county jail in Union in
lieu of $400,000 bond.
The victims were identified as
Richard K. Rau, 29, and Mark L.
Hall, 27, both of the Lonedell
area.

Author Doug De Bias gives advice to college
students in his book “Coming of Age in Babylon”
■ BY STEPH EN W H ITE
LIFESTYLE REPORTER

■ BY C O REY STU LCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
cstulce@ siue.edu

I spent a good part of
Saturday night w atching old
MGM Tex Avery cartoons with
some friends. Oh, how that
brought back memories of me as
a young boy in little cotton-poly
“Star Wars” pajamas, up before
dawn, watching countless hours
of animated mayhem. Yeah, I
sure miss 1994. But watching
those cartoons got me thinking. I
was wondering why now that my
friends are grown they still don’t
watch cartoons?
It didn’t take me long to find
the answer. Our generation’s
cartoons sucked.
Between the years of 1970
and 1985, there w asn’t one
consistently good cartoon series
produced. They were all thrown
together and unoriginal garbage.
Now, it’s som eone’s turn to
yell, “W hat about Scooby-Doo,
you jackass!” All right, I’ll give
you this much, Scooby-Doo was
a decent cartoon. But have you
watched any old Scooby’s
lately? You might notice that it
has poor animation and each
episode has the same plot.
Example: Scene one: The kids
are on the road. It’s nighttime.
They pull into a small,
mysterious town where someone
has a distant relative.
Scene two: They learn of
some mysterious being that has
been haunting the town.
Scene three: The kids split up.
Shaggy goes with Scooby, and
Fred takes the ladies. W hen he’s
not in the mood for a menage,
Velma goes with Shag and
Scoob.
Scene four: Shaggy and
Scooby see the m onster and try
to trick it with some odd
vaudeville act.
Scene five: The kids set a
trap. They catch the monster, and
discover (gasp!) that it’s Mr.
Crothers and he would have
gotten away with it if it hadn't
been for...yadda yadda yadda.
You see, no originality.
s e e RANTS, page 11

Ancient Babylon was a city of
great
wealth,
power
and
knowledge. But it was also a city
capable of great stupidity,
perversion and hypocrisy.
“The original Babylon was the
greatest civilization of its time,
with incredibly rich people,
slaves and technical advances
beyond those of any other city,”
Doug De Bias, the fifty-year-old
author of “Coming of Age in
Babylon” said.
“Nowadays,
Babylon
has
became
a
postm odern
term
for
contemporary civilization.”
W hatever you call today’s
world, it can be an awfully tough
place for a person coming of age
to grow up in. That’s why De Bias
— a first time author from
Princeton, New Jersey who
describes himself as an “idealistic
college student who never really
grew up” — has w ritten a
common sense guidebook for 18
to 25 year olds.”
“When I was 13, my dad took
me on a fishing trip,” De Bias
said. “He told me that it was
ultimately my responsibility to
decide my own reality.”
The fishing trip was a seminal
experience in his young life.
When he was in college in the late
’60s and early
’70s, the
fram ew ork for “Com ing of
Age...” was beginning to emerge
in De Bias’ mind. It w asn't until
about five to 10 years ago that he
began writing. But during the last
25 years he has been writing the
book in his head, so to speak.
“Coming of Age...” is not a
preachy self-help book. It’s a
collection of short essays written
in a humorous, colloquial manner
and it encourages young people to
“take their time,” “get off the
treadm ill” and to “experience

new things.” It all sounds rather
cliché, but De Bias has an
interesting way of weaving some
very simple concepts with
historical anecdotes, pop-culture
references and snappy, lyrical
writing. He doesn’t have all the
answers but neither does anyone
else and the nice part is that
he doesn’t claim to have all
the answers.
The central theme of this
simple but insightful book could
possibly be summed up in one
phrase: Be true to yourself,
regardless of what anyone else
wants you to be.
The dichotom y one faces
between exercising his or her own
free will and finding a way to live
in relative harmony with society
is
a
running
them e
in
the book.
De
Bias
believes
in
individuality but he doesn’t
believe in always going against
the status quo. In one essay, he
used an example of the “turn on,
tune in, drop out” movement led
by Timothy Leary in the ’60s.
“The whole counter-culture
became too m uch of an “us”
versus “them ” thing on both
sides,” he said. “We were
supposed to drop out of “the
system,” but the damn “system”
was what grew the food, built the
houses, kept our sorry asses warm
in the winter time, gave us bread
to get high, look cool and buy
Dead album s... It was like,
‘Don’t breath that polluted air,
man. You’ll be selling out, man.’”
Sometimes, the author said,
it’s necessary to buy into the
system, work your way up, then
try to change it, like Mikhail
Gorbachev, who worked his way
up the ladder in a totalitarian
government, then pulled the plug
on it.
De Bias has something to say
about nearly everything, from

Endearing ‘Tribe’
■ BY JIL L STEVENS
FOR THE ALESTLF.
In a non-typical role, Richard Dreyfuss
plays an anthropologist who is a single dad
trying unsuccessfully to raise his three kids
in the movie “K rippendorfs Tribe.” He has
been living off grant money that he was
supposed to use to study an “undiscovered”
tribe in New Guinea.
Now he has to give lectures and film
footage of his research. His lectures are a hit

politics, to religion, to drugs, to
homosexuality and even that most
private of subjects, masturbation.
“The
D eclaration
of
Independence calls upon you to
masturbate,” De Bias states in his
book. In another passage of the
essay on masturbation, De Bias
talks about his fears of “lightning,
hairy
palm s,”
and
“the social pathology that
accompanied the moniker “jerk
o f f ’... I was a jerk off for
not jerking m yself off! Good
thing I wasn’t hung up about
nose picking. I’d have really
gone crazy.”
As far as drugs go, De Bias
takes a fairly liberal stance on
their use. He believes that drugs
are an intrinsic part of our society
and therefore their use needs
to be balanced against the unique
predispositions
of
each
individual. De Bias recommends
in his book four basic rules of
drug etiquette: Never try to
persuade someone to take a drug

if they have never taken it before;
don’t do what you don’t think you
can handle, by the time you
realize that you can’t, it is way too
late; never put another person at
risk with your drug-related
stupidity; and don’t get caught
with more than you’re willing to
pay for.
“All of these things are simple,
but if you put them together, they
create an understanding,” De Bias
said. “This is a really simple
book, because life is complicated
enough. We have so much
information out there today, but
there’s not much understanding.
That’s really a problem.”
De Bias is not just another
crack pot philosopher. He
understands young people and he
has some genuine wisdom to
impart, although at times his book
gets a little crude.
“Coming of Age in Babylon”
is published by New Spring
Publications and is available at
book stores now.

as he bluffs his way through by
using his own family as a model
for the fictitious tribe. He begs his
children to help him in the scheme
by acting as tribe members for the
film footage.
This is a very endearing
comedy.
It
is
particularly
interesting and comical how North
American society was portrayed in
the context o f primitive cultural
rituals. This made for some very
outlandish
scenes.

Women’s hoops place second at GLVC
Tourney; get bid for NCAA Div. II Tourney
■ BY JASON TRIPLETT
SPORTS RF.PORTER
The G reat Lakes Valley
Conference wom en’s basketball
tournament did not end the way
the Cougars wanted, but second
place was good enough for the
women to get a bid to the NCAA
Division II tournament.
Cougar head coach Wendy
Hedberg thinks the team deserves
the bid.
“Every week the pressure
was on us to w in gam es,”
Hedberg said.
SIUE stomped over Kentucky
Wesleyan College in the first
round of the GLVC tourney last
Tuesday, Feb. 24. Next up was
No. 7 St. Joseph’s College
who upset the No. 2 seed

Lewis University in their first
round game.
The stage was set for the final
four in the GLVC tourney which
also included the University of
Southern Indiana and Northern
Kentucky playing on the other
side of the bracket.
SIUE senior Alicia Harkins
made her presence know n in
Evansville, Ind. by totaling 27
points in Friday’s 80-68 win. She
went to line 12 times where she
hit 11 free throw s in her 30
minutes of play.
Four Cougars scored in double
digits. Along with Harkins, junior
Kim Lowe and freshman Misi
Clark paired up for 30 points,
each scoring 15. Erica Cory, an
Indiana native, bombed the Lady
Pumas by hitting three of six from

the three-point line on her way to
17 points.
The win was not without a
fight. St. Joe forw ard Angie
Hupfer shot 68 percent from the
floor heading to her 27 point
display. Hupfer, without much
help, led her team with only
two other Lady Pum as in
double digits.
Southern Indiana supported
their assertion that the first game
with SIUE was a fluke by
jum ping all over the Cougars
early in their 83-70 championship
win on Saturday. SIUE never led
in the game.
In the first half, SIUE shot 36
percent from the floor and their
ever reliable three-point game
never showed up. The Cougars
shot 14 threes throughout the

Cougars end season with trip to semi-finals;
Margenthaler has best season of SIUE career
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
In a do or die situation, the
SIUE m en’s basketball team
hung tough, but could not get
past one of the n atio n ’s top
teams in the semi-finals of the
Great Lakes Valley Conference
tournament.
The Cougars ended their
season with a 95-81 loss to
top seeded Kentucky Wesleyan
College
on
Friday
in
Owensboro, Ky.
One of the shining statistics
for SIUE was the fact that they
out-rebounded one o f the nation’s
top rebounding teams.
“It was great to see us outrebound them,” head coach Jack
M argenthaler said. “You can ’t
help but to be proud when you

play the No. 4 team in the country
on their home court and make a
good showing.”
Although they didn’t shoot as
well as they usually do from
three-point range, Margenthaler
liked the way his team shot from
the field.
Once again,
SIUE
had
a balanced offensive attack
with four players scoring in
double figures.
Sophomore Travis Wallbaum
went eight of 12 from the field
for a team-high 19 points. He also
added nine rebounds in a losing
cause. Senior Rusty Sarnes ended
his SIUE career with an 18-point
perform ance and w orked the
glass for 12 boards.
“Rusty proved that he can
shoot from the perim eter this
season,” M argenthaler said about

his top scorer. “W e’ll miss his
aggressive play. He made one of
the greatest turnarounds that I’ve
ever seen from his junior to his
senior year.”
E ffingham ’s N athan Kreke
said farewell to the college game
with 15 points and six rebounds
against Kentucky Wesleyan.
“Nathan carries the total
package,” M argenthaler said.
“He works hard in the classroom
and on the basketball court.
He plays the total game. I
couldn’t have asked for any
more from him.”
D e’Vale Johnson pitched in
with 14 points going a perfect
five for five from the field.
The back court combination of
Shaun Smoot and M arlin Clark

contest and made only three. A
bright spot for the Cougars was
Harkins continuation of her play
from the St. Joseph’s game. She
played 40 minutes, scored 24
points and helped to hold USI’s
starting center Cathy Tepool to a
single point.
USI outscored the Cougars by
11 points in the first half. By
the time SIUE got their
composure, a stronger second half
was not enough.
The Screaming Eagles spread
the wealth as five players hit
double digits in scoring and only
one did not get on the board.
SIUE lacked the consistency to
keep up with the disciplined
Southern Indy squad. USI outrebounded their opponents 47-30
despite a 10 rebound game from

SIUE’s Lowe.
SIUE may have to face USI
once more this year. The Cougars
will play Michigan Tech in the
first round of the Great Lakes
Regional Tournam ent which
begins Thursday. The winner of
the Michigan Tech game will
play, you guessed it, top-seed
Southern Indiana.
This
is
SIU E’s
second
appearance in the tourney and
second meeting with Michigan
Tech. In the first contest, Tech
sent SIUE packing in the
69-57 loss.
Hedberg thinks her team is in
the right frame of mind for the
tournament.
“They believed they could get
to the playoffs, but to do it we had
to win,” she said.

‘Holy Cougar!’

The 1998 Cougar baseball season opened this weekend
with two road games. The Cougars return home tonight to
face the McKendree Bearcats at 2:30 p.m. at Roy E. Lee
Field.

Cougar softball open season with 2-1 record at Southern Classic
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Looking outside you w ouldn’t think it would be time to
oil up your glove and start swinging a bat, but softball
season is here.
The SIUE softball team kicked off their 1998 season
by hosting the Southern Classic last weekend.
Quincy University, Blackburn College and University
of Nebraska-Keamey joined SIUE in the round robin
tournament where the Cougars finished with a 2-1 record.
SIUE opened the tournament by thrashing Blackburn
25-0 in a five-inning affair on Saturday.
Sophomore Sara Obrecht picked up the two-hit victory
as she hurled five strikeouts in the game.
Peoria, 111. native Sarah Sollberger made an opening
game statement with her bat going five for five and adding
eight RBIs. Third baseman Erica Connett went four for
four with three runs scored and two RBIs and left fielder

Kim Messinger had three hits and knocked in three.
Junior Jessica Silbe followed up Obrecht’s shutout
with a shutout of her own against Quincy.
Although the game was scoreless after three innings,
SIUE turned it on in the bottom half o f the fourth. A fiverun inning gave SIUE a comfortable lead as they went on
to defeat Quincy 9-0 to move to 2-0 in the tournament.
“They threw their No. 1 pitcher and we still had 10
hits,” head coach Sandy Montgomery said.
M essinger had a three-hit game and scored a run.
Sophomore Kari Franzen, of Rantoul,Ill., went two for
three and scored twice while Kim Wagner, a Burbank, 111.
native, had two hits and an RBI.
The Cougars faced their first real test of the season
against the No. 5 ranked team in the national pre-season
poll, Nebraska-Kearney, in the final game of the classic.
Nebraska-Keamey jum ped out to a two-run lead in the
second before Gwen Jackson scored the first SIUE run in
the fourth.

The Cougars could not get a rally going as they ended
the game with only two hits. Nebraska-Kearney added an
insurance run in the bottom of the sixth to secure a
3-1 victory.
“We didn’t play that badly,” M ontgomery said. “Their
pitcher just threw a great game.”
Wagner and Messinger had the only two hits against
Nebraska-Kearney, who finished the Southern Classic as
the top team with a 3-0 record.
SIUE will host the Cougar Classic next weekend. It
will include the University of Southern Indiana, who are
5-0 so far this season, South Dakota State University and
the University of North Alabama.
Montgomery is happy to see her team doing well after
losing seven players from last year’s squad.
“This early you need to see what your team can do,”
M ontgomery said. “We only have one returning starting
outfielder and one returning starting infielder, so w e’re
still trying to adapt to the changes.”

also played their final game for
SIUE last Friday.
“Shaun will be tough to
replace,” Margenthaler said of his
team’s assist leader. “H e’s been
our point guard for the last three
years. H e’s such a good leader
out on the court.”
Clark has been with the team
the last two seasons after
transferring over from a junior
college.
“M arlin’s definitely our best
defensive player,” Margenthaler
said. “He’s picked up his game
dramatically this season.”
Tim Holloway is another
senior who hung up his red and
white jersey for the last tim e after
Friday’s game.

“Tim
always
gave
us
an
aggressive
attitude,”
Margenthaler said. “He played
with a lot of emotion and led
this team with his actions rather
than speech.”
The Cougars ended the season
with an 18-9 record, the best that
Margenthaler has seen as head
coach at SIUE.
“We made great strides this
season,” Margenthaler said. “Our
main goal was to make it to the
conference tournament and we
did that. It was great to see us
surpass that and have an
opportunity to play one of the
best teams in the country. The
program certainly made a giant
step this year.”
