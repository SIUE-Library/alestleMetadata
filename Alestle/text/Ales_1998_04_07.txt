three-day conference on the
contribution and struggles of
the
African
American
community in the state of
Illinois will begin tomorrow at
SIUE. The conference is being
sponsored by the department of
history, the College of Arts and
Sciences, the Office of the
Chancellor,

Graduate
School and the Office of the
Vice Provost for Social and
Cultural Diversity of Southern
Illinois
University
at
Edwardsville;
and
the
departm ent
of
African
American
studies,
the
department of history, and the
College of Arts and Sciences of
Western Illinois University.
“The purpose o f the
conference is to inform people
about Illinois African American
heritage and to celebrate
Illinois African A m ericans,”
said
Shirley
Portwood,
professor of historical studies
and a co-chair of the planning
committee for the conference.
Portwood said she would
like for people who attend

U.S. S ecretary o f Education holds round-table forum
on C linton’s program, “ America Reads Challenge”
■ BY D AN IELLE
BELTON
NEWS REPORTER
U.S. Secretary of Education,
Richard W. Riley, held a round­
table forum in the University
Center Meridian Hall at SIUE
on Monday to promote President
Clinton’s
America
Reads
Challenge. He lead the discus­
sion on helping American
elementary students and teachers
in their classrooms, while allowing
the students that made up the
panel a chance to tell their own
experiences with the program
as tutors.
According to Riley, the
program is now at over 900
colleges and universities. SIU’s
president Ted Sanders was one of
the first twenty who worked to
implement the program in their
university.

The pamphlet distributed at
the event stated that the America
Reads
Challenge
program’s
purpose is to recruit Federal Work
Study students to “tutor children to
read well and independently by the
end of the third grade.”
The students, most of whom
are early education majors, relayed
their stories with the students
they tutored and the things they
learned from the students while
working there.
“Any good teacher will tell
you they learn from their students,”
said Riley in response to one of the
students stories.
Some students relayed stories
of problematic students who had
trouble accepting them as their
tutors while others told stories of
students who had made it to the
third grade, but were unable to
read. One student told of her
disappointment when the school
held a open house to show the

parents what their children were
doing after school and out of the 25
students only two parents came.
Riley stressed that parental
involvement
is
extremely
important if improvement is ever to
take place in the education system,
citing
his
own
childhood
experiences as an example.
“When I was in the first
grade,” Riley said. “I remember
my mother coming to my
school in Greenville, (North
Carolina). That means everything
to a child.”
Riley sympathized with many
of the student’s problems and
triumphs with the children. He
discussed how all students learn
on different levels and how often
the short attention spans of children
can be difficult to manage while
an adult’s attention span is
much longer.
During the meeting, Riley also
discussed the need for education

students
to
have
these experiences in the classroom
with good teachers. He stressed
that the way for a student to learn
to become a good teacher is to
work closely with one, as many of
the students in the tutoring
program had.
“The way doctors have
always learned to be good doctors
is to work with good doctors,”
Riley said.
Using this analogy, Riley
further explained the importance of
the influence of good teachers over
education students.
Students also spoke of how
the children had helped enrich their
own lives. One female student
said that, “What I learned from
these kids, I could take wherever
I go for the rest of my life.” This
was the sentiment of a majority
of the students participating in
the program.

A critical essay on society
and our American culture
This is a m ost interesting world that we live in. As wondrous and beautiful as it appears
to be, there lies a certain amount of danger in it that can be nearly as seductive as it is deadly.
The beauty often lies behind the warmth of a mother’s touch, the love of a friend’s smile,
warm summer nights and sunshine after the rain. The seductiveness lies in the violence and
darkness of the world. Our American culture for all it’s glory and durability, hides behind a
Danielle seedy underbelly that gives way to the violence and anguish in our society.
Belton
This violence is painful and we often don’t wish to look at it because it is ugly, but it
is still there screaming "look at me, acknowledge my existence.” This ugliness is seen in the
eyes of the poor and desolate, the forgotten and the prisoner, and in the innermost workings o f our own
souls when we are forced to view it at uncomfortable times. It’s like when a woman sees a homeless man
on the street and instead o f pity, feels contempt and wishes he w asn't there. She’s wishing that she didn’t
smell his stench, that he didn’t invade her hallways and streets, thrusting his dirty hands in her face,
begging for a dollar, a quarter, anything. The paradox is that the woman knows she is wrong for feeling
the contempt because she has been raised to feel otherwise, but the feeling is still there. The paradox
causes a feeling o f shame, but she just shrugs it off eventually with thoughts of, “Oh well, what can you
really do about it?” That’s why they bussed the homeless people out of Atlanta in 1996 before the
summer Olympics began. Shame told them they were in the wrong, but they surely couldn’t have
the world think that America is a place made up of beggars and people caught in the threshold of
capitalist poverty.
That is our society today. We are the society of “we know better, but we do it anyway.” We know
that it’s really not right to feel contempt for the poor, but we do it anyway. We know that it’s not right to
eat that Big Mac at M cDonald’s but we do it anyway. We know that racism, sexism, fascism, and all other
bigotry is wrong, but we live in a world full of these behaviors anyway. None of these are disappearing,
and there is no quick solution to fix the problem.
People say that I must be sitting on a high horse envisioning perfection when I write, but I admit to
my faults. I know that I am not right all the time, and just like everyone else, sometimes I wish things
just weren’t there. If they w eren’t there, a person would never have to deal with it. And that it is what is
seductive. Denial is seductive. It’s like the man who says that there is no need for Affirmative Action and
the playing field is now level, when it’s obvious that racism and sexism still exist. How can a playing
field be level when white females are a majority of America’s population, but only make up a minority
of CEOs, managers, workers and entrepreneurs? Racism and sexism still exist, lurking around the
underground as bottom feeders, only occasionally resurfacing to rear their ugly heads among a nation of
denial filled sleepers.
Violence is treated the same way in our society. More prisons are built every day to house criminals,
big and small, but little rehabilitation is offered. The root to the problem is never brought to the surface
because to deal with the problem at the root would be to admit the problem exists, and historically and
psychologically, most people do not admit when they have a problem. Acknowledging that there is a
problem is the first step to solving a problem. In our country, we often offer solutions to problems that
we haven't even admitted were truly problems yet. There are people today that will say “Blacks were
happier when they knew their place.” That is denial; if they were happy they never would have rebelled
against the position they’d been placed in by society. And there is a shame in this when we know things
are wrong and we argue the contrary because of that denial. This shame results in nameless voices
shouting accusations, but having no solid ground to stand them on. That is our society and that is what
is most seductive about it. It is what is most violent and most peculiar. It is our denial of our problems.
The real world has always been an awakener of dreamers. It’s good that we come to college and
leave our safe, cozy worlds to search out new ones where we encounter the infinite wonders of our world,
but also must deal with the harsh realities of the violence and cruelness of our society. It is a bitter pill
to swallow. Ralph Ellison’s novel, “Invisible Man” is like that. A person realizing the result of their own
denials and acknowledging the same problems that before they would have denied that ever existed.

Computer network flaps raise
issue of free speech vs. taste
PORTLAND, Maine (AP) —
University of Maine sophomore
Casey Belanger sat down at the
computer in his dorm room and
typed a nasty, threatening
message to a fellow student he
had never met.
Using a slur for homosexuals,
he wrote that if he saw the
student, “I’m gonna shoot you in
the back of the (expletive) head.”
Inadvertently, he sent
the
message onto campus computer
bulletin boards, including one run
by a gay-lesbian group.
A week later, the state attorney
general slapped the 19-year-old
with a hate crim e law suit,
accusing him of violating the
civil rights of homosexuals.
“I don’t even know the guy,”
Belanger said in a telephone
interview from the campus in
Orono. “I was just mouthing off.”
On the Internet and via e-mail,
threats and offensive jokes fly
through cyberspace betw een
anonymous users, often without
repercussions.
But when such expressions
appear on college and university
com puter networks, they can
trigger com plaints or even
criminal investigations. They can
also set off a debate pitting First
A m endm ent
rights
against
campus administrators’ authority
and responsibilities.
“Universities are concerned
about libel and slander,” said
Peter Burke, an attorney.in the
corporate technology practice
group at Powell, G oldstein,
Frazer & Murphy, an Adanta and
W ashington law firm. “ By
operating e-mail systems, does
the
university
becom e
responsible for what gets posted
there?”
In some cases, Burke said,
universities and colleges are
walking the tightrope between
censorship and free speech.
“Some
universities
are
overreacting. T hey’re treating
electronic mail differently than
they would treat communications
using a pen and paper,” said
Barry Steinhardt, president o f the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
San Francisco-based online civil
liberties organization.
Steinhardt said colleges don’t
appear to care where students
send their mail via the U.S. Postal
Service, but with e-mail and the
Internet there is a trail they can
follow.
The University of Maine case
is one of many:
At Cornell U niversity in
Ithaca, N.Y., four freshmen sent a

K n o w

derogatory “joke” about women
to their friends through e-mail.
The message was sent in 1995 to
20 of the students’ friends, who
then passed it along to countless
Internet
e-mail
addresses,
prompting angry responses from
across the country. The four were
required to attend rape awareness
classes.
At the University of North
Carolina, officials closed an emai! account belonging to a
form er student after a racist
message from that account was
posted on at least 10 Internet
news groups. Anyone reading the
joke about “why all blacks should
go back to Africa” could see that
it originated at the university.
At Virginia Tech, a student
was punished for posting a note
on the World Wide Web page of a
gay organization that suggested
gay men be castrated and killed.
At Bates College in Lewiston,
Maine, a student used the
com puter network to type an
obscenity-laced message saying
she hated white people. Bates
officials called the message
“offensive and divisive.” The
college’s Hate Crimes and Bias
Com m ittee said the incident
alerted it to other student postings
— “sexist, racist, homophobic”
— and condemned them all as
“inappropriate in any context.”
Offensive or not, many would
argue such postings are free
speech, especially on campus,
where ideas are continuously
debated, Burke said.
“Do we have people deciding
what ideas are good or bad?” he
said. ‘“ Don’t say that, it might
offend somebody.’ ‘We’d rather
you speak good ideas so
everyone is happy.’”
David
M erkowitz,
a
spokesman for the Am erican
Council
on
Education,
a
W ashington-based
trade
association for 1,800 colleges
and universities, said incidents on
campus are forcing more and
more educators to reassess e-mail
and computer use policies.
“But the extent that it’s a
problem is difficult to gauge,” he
said.
At A merica Online, its 10
million subscribers must agree to
the terms of service: No
obscenities, no threatening, no
harassing.
If they fail to comply, they
lose their account, and in some
instances law enforcem ent is
alerted. AOL learns about
violations mainly through other
members, but it does not

reprimand users for the quality of
their e-mail jokes.
“There is an infinite amount of
information and communication
within the AOL community.
There is no way to monitor each
and every word, nor should we,”
said AOL spokeswoman Trish
Primrose.
Some businesses m onitor
employee
e-mail
content,
Steinhardt
said.
“Private
companies pretty much have a
carte blanche to control the use of
their own resources,” he said.
But public universities cannot
legally punish students for what
they say on the campus computer
network, Steinhardt said, unless
the mail constitutes a violation of
the law, like the Belanger case.
That incident started when
Belanger stated on his resume on
a student bulletin board that he
“disliked fags.” That prompted a
barrage of anonymous e-mail, he
said.
He sent the threatening
message to the person he thought
was sending the anonym ous
messages. But his message ended
up going to 10 other students as
well as the Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual
public conference folder and
three other computer folders.
Soon after, students alerted
campus security, w ho then
forwarded the matter to police
and the state attorney general’s
office.
“It all just got blown out of
proportion,” Belanger said.
The university ordered him to
serve 30 hours o f community
service and suspended his
com puter account. The state
w aived a $5,000 fine when
Belanger signed an agreement
prom ising not to harass or
threaten others.
Belanger said he would never
have said in-person w hat he
wrote while hidden behind his
screen name.
“It was just a spur o f the
moment thing,” he said. “Given
the
opportunity,
I
would
definitely go back and reword it.”
Maine A ttorney
General
Andrew Ketterer said there’s an
easy way to know when speech is
inappropriate
and
possibly
illegal: People should not be
scared by a message they receive
through their computer.
“I think that people may say,
‘Hey, I got a First Amendment
right to say whatever I w ant,” ’
Ketterer said. But he added: “It
does not include the right to
threaten.”

House passes bill giving Missouri $663 million annually
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Missouri would get $264 million
for specific highway projects —
and $3.5 billion overall for the
next six years under legislation
passed in the House.
“How many times have you
hit a pothole in the road, or heard
the horror stories about our
school buses scraping against the
tractor-trailers on a bridge that is
too narrow to cross?” said Rep.
Jo Ann Emerson, R-M o., a
m em ber
of
the
House
Transportation Committee.

“Building and improving
roads is one of the wisest
investments we can make
to improve the quality of life
for people right here at home,”
she said.
Under
the
m easure,
Missourians, who currently get
back 82 cents of every dollar they
pay in federal gasoline taxes,
would get back 95 cents on
the dollar.
The $217 billion measure
funds federal highway, bridge
and mass transit program s

through 2003. Missouri would
get nearly $663 million annually.
Emerson noted Missouri ranks
sixth in the nation in the number
of deteriorating bridges.
In addition, the bill earmarks
$264
million
in
specific
projects, including $45 million
to widen U.S. 63 in Randolph
and Boone counties, $40 million
to widen Missouri 21 in Jefferson
County and a total of $3.7 million
— in both highw ay and bus
funds for a bus exchange and
parking lot at the M issouri

Botanical Garden in St. Louis.
The
last
six-year
transportation plan expired last
fall. A provisional program ends
May 1, leaving less than two
weeks for House and Senate
negotiators
to
reach
a'
compromise upon returning from
the spring recess.
Other differences between the
two versions include:
The House bill separates the
highway trust fund, which is
financed by gas taxes, from the
general budget. The Senate bill

keeps the trust fund in the
general budget.
Senators did not opt to
designate special projects. The
House set aside 5 percent, or
$9 billion, for about 1,500
projects lawmakers requested for
their districts.
The
Senate
includes
a
provision to slash federal funds
for states that fail to establish
.08 percent blood alcohol content
as the drunk driving standard.
House leaders would not allow
a vote on the .08 percent
national standard.

Former gang members have ta tto o s removed during laser surgery
DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Allison breathes deeply
then lets out an expletive as the laser snaps and sparks against
her skin.
The laser is vaporizing the pigment left behind when she
allowed a gang member to tattoo her — using India ink and
a needle and thread on a playground at her
middle school.
For years, the black cross with teardrops on her hand and
the cryptic “A” between her breasts have symbolized her ties
to a gang, her bad decisions, her delinquency.
“I was horrible,” she said, breaking into quiet tears as she
recalled being an eighth-grader who hung out with gangs. “I
was really disrespectful to my mom. We got in actual
fistfights. I would run away from home all the time, wouldn’t
come home at night, wouldn’t let her know where I was.”
There is clear remorse in the voice of this now 17-yearold, who has gone from skipping school nearly every day to
earning A’s and B’s on her report card. Allison, who spoke on
condition her surname was not used, longed for a chance to
start fresh, for a clean slate.
Both literally and symbolically.

It led her to Delray Beach plastic surgeon Gary
Rosenberg, who has donated his laser skills for the
past six years to remove the tattoos from dozens of former
gang members who have vowed to go the straight
and narrow.
Black marks on the fingers, necks and faces of former
members can scare off potential employers or friends —
even if the individual has left the gang life behind, Rosenberg
said.
Removing
the
tattoos
can
be
the
last hurdle.
“Also, it’s a way to sever the ties,” he said.
“It’s symbolic.”
An assistant principal at a local high school originally
referred the former gang members to Rosenberg. But in
September, Rosenberg joined forces with Palm Beach
County authorities and local hospitals to launch a one-year
pilot program which he hopes will serve as a model for other
communities.
The new program has the approval of the court system
because all participants must submit to being photographed
with their tattoos in case they ever fall back into criminal or

$Unin 6tteet <£ufe

gang-related activity, he said.
The procedure, which usually costs from $1,200 to
$1,600, is free to adolescents under 19 who sign a contract
to stay away from gangs, complete their high school
education — or if they’ve already completed it, to go on to
college or a job.
The procedure usually takes three to four 15-minute
sessions with the laser. And while Rosenberg said the surgery
hurts no more than an elastic band snap, some of his patients
heartily disagree.
Take Jane, the former girlfriend of a gang member who
left her an indelible reminder of their relationship: his initials
tattooed just above her pubic hair.
“It made me realize what a mistake it was because it
doesn’t feel too good getting it off,” said the 17-year-old
woman, who asked that her real name not be used.
Several U.S. cities have well-established gang tattoo
removal programs while other areas have doctors, such as
Rosenberg, who donate time individually, according to the
National Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.

Lawmakers seek to put legal reins on the internet
SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) —
Many users of the Internet have
found how easy it is to buy
liquor, gamble, find pornography
or get cheated over the global
computer network. Too easy, in
the eyes of Illinois lawmakers
who want to impose controls.
At least 17 bills have been
introduced in the G eneral
Assembly to regulate aspects of
the Internet, a new
and
freew heeling industry as yet
largely untouched by state or
federal regulations and taxes.
Many of the bills are aimed
at keeping pornography away
from children or providing
consumer protections for users of
Internet services.
Gene Rose, a spokesman for
the National Conference of State
Legislatures, said the Internet

was “definitely at the top of the
list” when the group compiled a
ranking of issues likely to face
legislatures this year.
“It’s such a rapidly growing
industry and som ething that
people have a lot o f concerns
about,” Rose said.
David Banisar, staff counsel
for
the
W ashington-based
Electronic Privacy Inform ation
Center, thinks law m akers are
attracted to cyberspace issues
because they are trendy and seem
to invite political intervention.
“Up until about two years ago,
most people didn’t know what
the Internet was, including state
legislators,” Banisar said.
“The Internet is nearly
mainstream now, as scary as that
is, and the censors and the taxers
say,
‘Hey, this
is really

happening.’ They think they can
control it like they do zoning.”
While the Internet is new, the
legislative process it provokes is
old-fashioned. Typically, an
established lobby seeks a bill that
then is pushed by sympathetic
lawmakers.
For instance, services that sell
liquor through the mail or on the
Internet would be curbed under a
bill sought by the Associated
Beer Distributors of Illinois and
sponsored by Rep. Jay Hoffman,
D-Collinsville, and Rep. Angelo
Saviano, R-River Grove.
“It’s nearly im possible to
control what our children are able
to access through the Internet,”
said Hoffman.
Saviano added, “Many kids as
young as 16 have debit cards with
their checking accounts that work

TATTOO--------------

In his program , w hich is
among the most comprehensive
in the country, the children are
screened by the courts and
psychologists. T hey’re also
required to perform 20 hours of
community service for each laser
treatment.
"This is really the carrot that’s
kind of held out at the end of the
long process,” Ptak said.
Such program s are not
without risk for the doctors, who
often are erasing pow erful
symbols of death or hatred or
violence.
Rosenberg admitted to being
scared by a couple of young
men who wanted him to

remove their tattoos.
“You can see hate on their
faces,” he said. “If they come in
and they’re hateful and spiteful
and show no remorse ... I usually
won’t operate on them.”
For the most part, though, the
youngsters are a delight, he said.
And they feel the same
about him.
“I think it’s very good
there’s somebody actually out
there that will say, ‘Hey, I
know they were bad kids,
but they can turn around,” ’
Allison said. “H e’s an excellent
guy
for
noticing
it
—
realizing there are kids who
want to change.”

from page 7

The association had sought to
coordinate all the efforts into
a national cam paign, but that
effort has failed so far because
the programs rely so heavily on
local support.
Jeffrey Ptak, a Phoenix
plastic surgeon, has worked with
about a dozen doctors to
successfully treat 100 children
since mid-1994. His program has
removed tattoos from children as
young as age 8 who have been
forcibly marked by older gangbanging siblings.

just like a major credit card.
Children are able to order alcohol
through the Internet or a catalog
and it’s delivered right to their
doorstep.”
Their bill, which passed the
House unanim ously and is
pending in the Senate, would
require consumers to prove they
are at least 21 before receiving
the liquor. Also, beer and liquor
sellers would have to get Illinois
liquor licenses, pay taxes here
and arrange for deliveries
through local businesses.
Louis Amoroso, president of
Beer Across America Inc., based
in Lake Bluff, said, “Young kids
don’t order alcohol from the
Internet.
The
product
is
expensive and the minor doesn’t
know when the product is going
to be delivered, maybe at

5:15 p.m. right when mom and
dad get home from work.”
Amoroso, who has battled
with liquor-control officials in
Utah and Florida over shipments
to those states, said of the Illinois
bill, “I don’t really think there is
a need for it, but the legislation as
it is doesn’t really bother us.”
Not all the proposals would
curtail Internet commerce. A bill
pushed by Attorney General Jim
Ryan and sponsored by Rep. Jim
Durkin, R-W estchester, would
boost it by making electronic and
digital signatures as legally valid
as written ones.
“Businesses will flock to
states that have laws that treat
electronic documents the same as
written docum ents and that
provide a stable set of rules that
govern electronic transactions,”
Ryan said.

So, part one of the great
Clinton sex-fiend scandal has
ended. Paula Jones won’t be
getting her trial after all. She
might still get her photo spread
in “Hustler,” though. We’ll keep
our fingers crossed.
Boy, I am so sick of hearing
about the president’s supposed
sexual antics. W hat is the big
deal? So, the man likes sex, and
not always with his wife. H e’s
certainly not alone in that boat.
Why is it news? I would prefer a
sexually satisfied president to a
repressed one any day.
Without the occasional run
through the lilies, he would be
on edge. He would have to get
satisfaction elsewhere, like
picking fights with smaller, more
defenseless countries.
It’s like the school bully. H e’s
usually a big, frightening, ugly
kid. He doesn’t have many
triends, much less a girlfriend,
so his sexual frustration is
worked out by beating up the
smaller kids. It’s a vicious cycle.
Besides, why is it any of our
business anyway? My biggest
fear right now is becoming
famous and having the world
discover my deviant sexual
behavior. (So afraid, in fact, that
I share more of it than I should
with my readers.)
The entire world has become
that nosy middle-aged neighbor,
with the hair constantly in giant
pink curlers, cat-eye glasses, a
flowered mu-mu, and binoculars.
She’s always got her head stuck
through the curtains, looking for
gossip. It’s disturbing, because
that is her life’s pleasure. Which
means, other people’s sex lives
have become our pleasure.

At least “Lost in Space’’ had one big first:
making Gary Oldman appear completely
normal (and boring). Other than that, there
was nothing new under the sun. It’s very
unfortunate. “Lost” had the potential to be a
fun sci-fi franchise.
The film is based on the old cheese-ball
television series from the ‘60s, which tells the
tale of the Robinson family who, in an effort
to save Earth, get lost in the outer reaches of
uncharted galaxy. Along for the ride are
peppy pilot Major Don West, the diabolical
Dr. Smith (Oldman) and Robot, who utters
the catchphrase of the show and film,
“Danger, Will Robinson.”

The movie is lost from the get-go. It can’t
decide what it wants to be, the campy show
from the ‘60s, a serious sci-fi adventure, or a
fam ily-bonding experience. All three are
attempted, and all three fail for the most part.
There is a very slow start to establish the
characters and the mission for the family.
That is forgivable, but even after the action
begins it feels slow. The special effects are
great in number, but nothing seems new. The
computer effects do not seem realistic enough
to get the audience to believe that the
Robinsons are in any real danger.
The only semi-believable part of the story
is the mixed-up children. Dad (William Hurt)
has been working on this project for years,
apparently, and his kids are starving for
attention. Judy (Heather Graham) became a
doctor in order to work side-by-side with her

father. Penny (Lacey Chabert) becam e a
rebellious pre-pubescent. And Will (Jack
Johnson) experim ented with space and
time to get appreciation from dear old dad.
O f course, none of them are very interesting.
The entire look of the film is dark and
bleak, and the action sequences bring
long yawns.
The biggest crime of all had to be stifling
poor Gary Oldman. Dr. Smith could have
been a great showcase role for him, but
instead he spends much of the film locked in
a small room. We know Oldman can be
brilliantly evil, so let him. Unfortunately, the
filmmakers thought it would be a great idea to
have him turn into a giant com puter­
generated bug. But by that time, the story is
lost, and the audience doesn’t care any more.

New David M am et film p u ts gum shoes to th e te s t
NEW YORK (AP) — A police
van pulled up outside the posh
screening room where some of
New York City’s most illustrious
gumshoes had a murder to solve,
a celluloid killing, courtesy of
David Mamet.
“The Spanish Prisoner,” a
Mamet mystery opening Friday
in New York, was previewed a
day early for the detectives, who
were challenged to s o lv e 'th e
mystery before the film ended.
“If we can’t solve this, nobody
can. Because w e’re the best,”
said a confident Bo Dietl, who, as
a city detective, cracked a
notorious case of a sexual attack

on a nun and now heads Bo Dietl
Investigations.
The twists and turns o f the
Sony Pictures Classics release
had the pros scratching their
heads when producer Jean
Doumanian stopped the film 15
minutes before the end. The top
cops had three minutes to come
up with the mastermind behind
the crime, a telltale clue — and
the ending.
No suspense here. All the
detectives solved the whodunit,
although
each
nam ed
a
different clue.
The film centers on an
elaborate confidence game.

Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) has
invented “the process,” a topsecret formula that has his boss
(Ben Gazzara) seeing gobs of
money. He flies Joe to a secret
meeting on a Caribbean island,
but remains vague about how
much of the profit Joe will see.
Joe meets Jimmy Dell (Steve
Martin), a mysterious jet-setter,
and confides he’s worried about
getting his share. Jimmy offers
to help.
Joe soon loses faith in his
company, his colleague George
(Ricky Jay), Jimmy, and even the
secretary with an obvious crush
on him, Susan, played by

M amet’s wife, Rebecca Pidgeon.
Before long, there’s a murder.
“It was a classic bait and
switch. Steve M artin gave it
away with a comment he made
early on. I guess I got two-thirds
of it,” said Sly Francis, a
detective in the Brooklyn District
Attorney’s office.
A1 Sheppard, a former Major
Case Squad detective and one of
the most decorated cops in New
York Police Department history,
fingered the perp right away. But
he admitted the ending threw him
for a loop.
“It was,” he said, “very cute.”

and Jackson’s spokesman, did not immediately
return telephone calls seeking confirmation of the
birth. A woman answering the phone at the Beverly
Hills clinic refused to comment.
Jackson and his wife, a nurse for one of his
doctors, were married in N ovem ber 1996 in
A ustralia. Their first child, Prince, was born
Feb. 13, 1997.
Last year, Mrs. Jackson said her husband was
excited about a second child.
“H e’s picking out clothes already to dress her up.
He loves kids,” she said. “I hope we have a lot of
kids together. H e’s such a great dad.”
She said the singer enjoys fatherhood and being
at the ranch with Prince.
“It’s heaven. It’s heaven. It’s where he can get
away and be a dad and be a kid — with his kid,” she
said. “Oh, whenever the baby is awake, he is with
the baby the whole time. When the baby is napping,
that’s when he steals away to work, to write music,
to dance.”

within reason.
I w ouldn’t
encourage anyone to start staking
out the playgrounds. That’s sick
and depraved. But, if being led
around on a dog leash with a
banana hanging out of your
posterior gets you through the
day without having a breakdown,
I say just do it. I w on’t be lurking
in the comer taking pictures for
“The Globe,” so you don’t have
that to worry about.

And for the rest of you out
there who “tsk tsk” those who
aren’t afraid to get creative and
enjoy their bodies, get a hobby.
There are plenty of other ways
you can kill time. Or if you feel
the need to make the world a
better place, instead of worrying
about people’s sex lives, you can
spend some time and energy on a
worthwhile cause: getting old
people off the highways.

S o ftb a ll adds th re e m ore conference v ic to rie s to te a m s ’ record
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Add three more conference
victories to the SIUE softball
team ’s record after a solid
performance from the pitching
staff last weekend.
The Cougars are peaking at an
opportune time as the regular
season starts to wind down.
SIUE has won seven of their last
eight with one more weekend of
games to play before the
Great Lakes Valley Conference
tournament begins.
A 3-0 win over Bellarmine
College set the tone for a
productive weekend. Junior
pitcher Jessica Silbe threw a no­
hitter in recording her seventh
victory of the season.
Junior Niki Mitts, of Morton,
hit a home run and sophomore
Kari Franzen not only caught
Silbe’s no-hitter, but also
doubled.
“Jessica pitched an excellent
game,” head coach Sandy

M ontgomery said.
“We played solid
defensively
and
really
stayed
focused the entire
game.”
It was Deanna
Sm ith’s turn to
continue
SIU E’s
stellar pitching as
she picked up the
win in a 4-1 victory
over the University
of Southern Indiana
in the second game
on Sunday.
The
Cougars
were out-hit 7-6,
but were
more
productive
than
their
opponents.
Mitts crushed her
second homer of
the day and fourth
of
the
season.
S o l l b e r g e r
contributed a double
and hit her teamleading eighth long-

ball of the season.
“We hit the ball
well and played
sound defense,”
Montgomery said.
“Sollberger
and
Mitts showed their
offensive abilities
and Erica Connett
made some big
plays for us at
third base.”

Men’s tennis ups record to
10-1; ranked 14th in nation
■ BY SARAH FINLEY
SPORTS EDITOR
The SIUE m en’s tennis team is
not fooling around when it comes
to being the best at what they do.
This past w eekend, the
Cougars showed w hat they
could do by winning all three
home games.
Thursday,
the
Quincy
University Hawks visited the
Cougars’ courts only to go home
with their feathers ruffled. SIUE
beat Quincy 9-0. Justin Lombard
and Keith Harvie didn’t give up
any points winning each of their
matches 6-0, 6-0.
Friday, Indiana University/Purdue

University-Ft. Wayne descended
upon the courts, turned around
and went back home with a 7-1
loss. Jason Stephens was the lone
shutout for the Cougars.
Finally,
Saturday,
the
University
of
Indianapolis
Greyhounds raced into Cougar
territory only to be scared out
with a loss of 6-3.
With a 10-1 overall record and
a 8-0 conference record, the
Cougars face two colleges with
national rankings.
Drury College is ranked 11th
in the nation and Southwest
Baptist in ranked ninth.
The Cougars take on Drury
April 8 and Southwest April 10.

And he is.... !?!

K e n t u c k y
Wesleyan College
in a 9-1 win
that lasted only
five innings.
Silbe allowed
three hits and only
gave up a first
inning run to boost
her record to 8-5
on the year.
Gwen Jackson
helped out on the
offensive end by
hitting her teamleading third triple

of the season. SIUE had a total
o f eight hits in a win that
put them in second place
in the Southwest Division of
the conference.
“I think w e’re finally getting
over the hump,” M ontgomery
said. “The field conditions
w eren’t the best, but we
played with a lot of poise
and composure.”
The trio of victories gives
SIUE an overall record of 21-15
and a GLVC mark of 13-4.
The Cougars will
host
U niversity
of
M issouri-St.
Louis
today
and
Quincy
University tomorrow in a pair of
doubleheaders.
SIUE has already taken two
games from UMSL earlier this
season, but lost both games
against first place Quincy.
“We’re confident that we can
beat Quincy because they lost
to Southern Indiana, who we
beat,” Montgomery said. “This
conference is a mixed-up mess.
It’s just going to depend on who
plays the best down the stretch.”

3 Southwest Texas gridders charged with raping 2 women
AUSTIN (AP) — Southwest
Texas State University students
say alcohol consum ption in
campus dormitories is common.
Police say alcohol apparently
played a part in the alleged rape
of two female students by three
Southwest Texas football players.
Tobias D. D eans, 19, and
Jeremy C. D ennis, 20, told
campus police they had sex with
one of the women after a March
22 party at a dormitory on the San
Marcos campus, a police report
says.
The party took place in the
dorm room of Elverna Williams
II, 22, who has told police he had
sex with the other woman after
the party, the police report says.

All three men were charged
with sexual assault and are
free on $5,000 bail, attending
classes pending a judicial hearing
at the university.
Both women told police they
were too drunk to consent to sex,
the Austin American-Statesman
reported in Saturday’s editions.
Drinking in Southwest Texas
State dorms is common, students
told the A m erican-Statesm an
Friday. University police concede
it’s a tough problem to address.
Campus police C hief John
M egerson said 27 university
officers police more than 4,000
students who live on the San
Marcos campus.
‘"If we were to arrest every

(minor in possession) who had a
bottle of beer in the dorm, we
wouldn’t have time for anything
else,” Megerson said.
Students o f legal drinking age
may drink in the dorms but not in
public areas, M egerson said.
Police generally confiscate any
alcohol found in the possession of
minors in the dorms, he said.
Two of the men charged with
sexual assault were under the
legal drinking age. However,
underage-drinking charges will
not be filed because officers did
not see the students with alcohol,
the police chief said.
Officers are called two to three
times a week to parties at one of
the university’s 16 dorms,

Athletes plead guilty in football book scandal
TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — A
University of A rizona football
player
and
a
form er
teamm ate pleaded guilty to
stealing textbooks from an
athletic departm ent bin and
reselling them.
Leland O. Gayles and Mikal
E. Smith, both 21, also agreed to
pay a total of $3,000 restitution to
the university bookstore.
Prosecutors agreed to drop
one fraud charge against each
defendant in exchange for the
guilty pleas.
Both were suspended from
the university for one semester
and from the football team

last season.
When they are sentenced next
month, they could be given
probation or prison terms of up to
two years by a judge who will
decide whether to consider the
crimes misdemeanors or felonies.
Smith, a starting safety as a
sophomore who now resides in
Tampa, Fla., said he hopes the
judge won’t deem his offense a
felony since that would prevent
him from joining the Marines as
he hopes to do. H e’s to be
sentenced on May 1.

rejoined the team this spring, will

When they were arrested in
June, more than 60 textbooks
were found in G ayles’ car.
Investigators said they took
advantage of their scholarship
status under w hich athletes
obtained books through the
athletic department rather than
the bookstore.
The university has altered its
policies since the scandal that
included
abuses
by
12
scholarship athletes and led to
a reprimand by the Pacific 10
Conference.

Megerson said. Criminal charges
are rarely filed, he said.
“It’s pretty easy to get alcohol
in the dorm s,” said Stacey
Orozco, who lives in one of the
dorms. “The university police
don't come around very often ...
and there is really only one
(resident assistant) on each floor”
to enforce the rules.
Students said Friday that the
incident was unfortunate but
difficult to stop.
“This kind of thing is going to
happen
everyw here,”
said
sophomore Justin McDonald.
“People just need to know that
this can happen to anybody, even
you. If you have a place to go to
report it and get counseling, it can

help, but people just need
to be aware that these things
go on.”
Student opinions varied about
what should happen to the three
athletes,
who
have
been
suspended from the football
team and removed from the Bexar
Hall dorm.
“If they did it, get them out
of here. Definitely kick them

Mathews said.

Steelers, Gildon agree
on 4-year deal, $9 million
PITTSBURGH (AP) — Fresh
off a record-setting deal with
Levon Kirkland, the Pittsburgh
Steelers agreed to a four-year
deal with linebacker Jason
Gildon that will pay him almost
$9 million.
Gildon, an unrestricted free
agent, has been the Steelers’
starting outside left linebacker
since Kevin Greene opted for
free agency two years ago.
The deal comes on the heels
of K irkland’s five-year, $25
million contract, which made
him the highest-paid inside

linebacker in the NFL.
Gildon, like Kirkland, had
five sacks last season.
The deal helps solidify the
team’s defense. Besides Gildon
and Kirkland, the Steelers also
signed nose tackle Joel Steed to a
four-year, $15.4 million deal.
The only unrestricted free
agent left on the team is strong
safety Myron Bell.
With the signing o f Gildon,
the Steelers now must decide
what to do with outside
linebacker Greg Lloyd.

Denver could pay $30 million for Broncos stadium
DENVER (AP) — A proposed
$266 million taxpayer subsidy
for a new Broncos stadium may
not be enough and the city could
have to, contribute as much as
$30 million for road and
utility im provem ents, the city
attorney said.
A bill pending in the state
Legislature asks taxpayers in the
six-county stadium district to
approve a 0.1 percent sales tax to
cover 75 percent of the cost of a
$350 m illion stadium . The
Broncos would pay the other
25 percent.
But City Attorney Dan Muse
says cost estimates are only for
construction.
A ccess
roads,
utilities and land will cost $70
million, he said.

“We think the project is going
to run short,” Muse said. “And
we’re not going to stand in the
way of this project getting off
the ground.”
Liz Orr, the city ’s lead
negotiator on the stadium, noted
the $350 million stadium budget
could change before it is sent
to the governor. The House and
Senate must reach a compromise
on different versions of the
proposal.
The House version, for
example, proposes expanding
the stadium district. That would
mean a larger tax base for
the project.
Muse said the 80-acre stadium
site now home to Mile High
Stadium and McNichols Arena

will cost $40 million. The city
must sell its land for fullmarket value.
And changes to public
utilities, water and sewage lines,
streets, Interstate 25 interchanges
and drainage work to deal with
the South Platte River flood plain
will cost another $25 million to
$30 million, he said.
Muse suggested that public
works funds and the c ity ’s
general fund surplus could be
tapped
to
finance
the
infrastructure. Some council
members were not receptive to
the idea.
Orr suggested costs could be
covered by proceeds from the
land sale.

Mark McGwire remains on his 162-home run pace
ST. LOUIS (AP) — Mark
McGwire remains on his 162home run pace.
M cGwire became only the
second player in NL history to
homer in the first four games of
the season, tying Willie M ays’
record with a towering three-run
shot in the St. Louis Cardinals’ 86 victory over the San Diego
Padres Saturday.
McGwire has 12 RBIs, all on
home runs, and has homered in
six consecutive games dating to
last season, when he fell only
three short of Roger M aris’
record of 61 in 1961. Mays was
39 years old when he homered in
four consecutive games for San
Francisco in 1971.
The Cardinals led 3-2 heading
into the sixth when Royce
Clayton and Delino DeShields hit
singled
before
M cG w ire
homered over the center-field
fence off Don Wengert.
CINCINNATI (AP) — Brett
Tomko, one of the Cincinnati’s
biggest concerns during spring
training, pitched a career-high
eight innings and singled home
a run as the Dodgers remained
winless.
At 0-4, the Dodgers are off to
their worst start in 11 years. The
Dodgers’ worst start since they
moved to Los Angeles is 0-5, a

mark they reached in 1970, 1976
and 1987.
Tomko, who m issed three
weeks of spring training because
of shoulder tendonitis, had little
trouble with the w eak-hitting
Dodgers in his season debut,
allowing only three hits — a
single, double and triple — while
striking out seven. Los Angeles
came into the game with a .178
team batting average, secondworst in the National League.
Ismael Valdes (0-1) took the
loss.
NEW YORK (AP) — Rich
Becker’s single over a drawn-in
outfield in the 13th inning gave
New York its third win in its final
at-bat this season.
New York, which scored once
in the eighth an three times in
the ninth to tie it 6-6, has played
four straight one-run games to
start the year with two going to
extra innings.
The Mets, who led the majors
with 47 comeback wins in 1997,
tied it in the ninth on John
O lerud’s two-run double and
Butch Huskey’s RBI groundout.
Becker went 3-for-5 with a
home run, two walks and three
RBIs. He also made a diving
catch to save two runs in the
second inning and threw out a
runner at the plate in the first.
