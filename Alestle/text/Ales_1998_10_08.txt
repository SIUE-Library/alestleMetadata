Workers win Round One
BY NANCY BERG
NEWS STRINGER
Parking fees may be rolled back to
1995 rates for two groups of campus
employees, if a recent decision by the
Illinois Educational Labor Relations
Board stahds.
On Friday,
Sept.
25, SIUE
professional
and
technical . staff
represented by the Illinois Education
Association, received word that the labor
board upheld a decision in their favor
handed down in D ecem ber by an
administrative law judge. In the judge’s
opinion, the SIU E board of trustees
violated the Illinois Labor Relations Act
by refusing to bargain in good faith with
the professional and technical staff
associations over campus parking fees,
and by unilaterally increasing those fees
without notice to their bargaining units.

& EDWARDSVILLE

According to the labor board order,
the university must "rescind the increase
in fees that was initiated in the 1996-97
school year until the bargaining
obligation is fulfilled, and make whole all
employees affected.”
In 1996, staff could purchase blue
stickers for $30 or green stickers for
$60 — now $70 and $100, respectively.
The price of students’ red stickers has
jum ped from $20 to $60. Originally
projected as a three-year phased increase
of $55 per sticker, the hike was intended
to offset the costs o f extensive
improvements to parking lots. University
officials sought input from other campus
groups, but did not address the issue with
the unions. It was the university’s
position that parking fees were not a term
or condition of employment, and so did
not need to be bargained. But a majority
of the labor board disagreed.

With a growing student population,

Food Service saw the need additional
food choices and seating.
After surveying students, Lyle Ward,
assistant director of the University Center,
said, “The students wanted a chicken-type
establishment.” Chick-fil-A is the answer.
The national representative from the
Chick-fil-A restaurants will attend the
celebration along with the chancellor,
vice chancellor and student leadership.
Tuesday’s grand opening will include

Civil rights lawyer and writer Salome M. Heyward headed a panel
Wednesday in the Goshen Lounge of the University Center. Heyward
was there to promote SiUE’s first Disability Awareness Day in 10
years. The question/answer session with the panel was entitled,
“Rights and Responsibilities of Students with Disabilities.”
BY LISA GULICK
NEWS STRINGER
SIUE’s recognition Wednesday of
Disabilities Awareness Month turned
out to be a success.
“If you can help one person, it’s
better than zero,” said Steve M ueller of
Impact Inc., an organization that helps
people with disabilities lead productive
and independent lives.
More than 20 organizations
attended the event in the G oshen
Lounge of the M orris U niversity
Center to
prom ote
D isabilities

Awareness Month and to educate
people about disabilities. Although
some representatives said they were
disappointed by the number of people
who stopped by, they said they hoped
they made an impression and raised the
awareness of those who took the time
to get information.
A panel discussion in the UC
consisted of four SIUE students and
Salome M. Heyward, a civil rights
lawyer who is involved in various
aspects of discrimination through her
law practice.

“I was ecstatic that the vote
was what it was,” said Melanie
Schoenborn, a Lovejoy Library
technical assistant and grievance
representative for the Technical
Staff Association. “I’m not clear on
what’s going to happen n e x t... I’ll
be curious to see what the
university decides to do.”
The board of trustees has 35
days to appeal the decision to an
appellate court, if it so chooses.
A.G. Monaco, SIUE director
of personnel services, said the labor
board decision was not unexpected
but was “unusual and heartening
because it was a split decision. One
member dissented totally and
another agreed with the majority,
but disagreed with the reasoning.”
He said that while the BEA
would prefer the labor board made
the decision, “the courts will have
to decide. We expected a year ago
to have to appeal. This is not
uncommon.”
Monaco said the university
could not pass on the increased
costs to students and other
employees because one group did
not want to pay higher fees.
LaDonna
Holshouser,
a
writing instructor for Instructional
Services and president of the

T h e
Professional Staff Association, said
her unit and the Technical Staff
Association had each filed separate
unfair labor practice charges
against the university two years
ago. The two associations have a
combined membership of about
400.
“We hope the university will
abide by the labor board’s ruling
and not appeal this decision,”
Holshouser said. She noted SIUE
has already spent a great deal of
money and time on this case.
“We feel it would be more
efficient and less costly for the
University to bargain with us on the
parking issue,” Holshouser said.
She pointed out that the
increase in fees for the 1997-98
school year was an issue of concern
for all affected students, faculty and
staff. Holshouser empathized with
such low-income groups as
students, part-time staff and
particularly call staff, who pay a
full year’s rate for parking even
though they may work only one
semester.
“We were not out to win at the
expense of those who were not
represented. ... We feel there is a
better way to set parking fees than
unilateral huge increases. We are all
in the same boat, and will be until
the university works through the
whole process,” Holshouser said.

“Sometimes
we
take
disabilities lightly,” said Mamie
Coscey, preschool director for

the disabled.”

And, the end is not in sight

Yes, karaoke has arrived and

Davis said.
Karaoke night will be in the

packed with singing and a lot of

vocal skills.
Warning: This event can
prove to be enjoyable and fun

Anyone interested in having

Pow er, tw e n ty pounds,
beauty myths and Oprah
My African-American literature teacher brought a
magazine to class this week. It was this m onth’s Vogue
with Oprah Winfrey on the cover. My class had just
finished studying Toni Morrison’s novel “The Bluest
Eye." The teacher used the Vogue cover to further
illustrate Morrison’s character, Pecola, a young black girl
who wants to have blue eyes. Pecola and apparently
Winfrey seek physical ideals prescribed by someone else.
To get on the cover of Vogue to sell her new movie ‘'Beloved,”
another Toni Morrison novel, Vogue told Winfrey she would have to
lose 20 pounds. Winfrey is one of the most powerful women in
media today. My teacher commented how Winfrey could purchase
Vogue if she wanted to, yet to get on the cover, she had to lose 20
pounds and she did.
I found the whole thing very disturbing. Here was Oprah
Winfrey, sprawled out on the cover of Vogue in a tight black dress,
her body contorted and canted to the camera, her cheekbones
heightened and defined and her waist shrunk in to Victorian
standards. On the grass, she reclined in a Matisse harem girl pose
looking very plastic. Over and over again it went through my head
that she didn’t look real. It was as if Winfrey had conformed to the
status quo she was supposed to be debunking.
I’m not an avid Oprah watcher, but I have admired her for
several reasons. She’s tough, she’s competitive, she knows how to
get on top and stay there, she has power and influence and is a hero
to many women. She is especially a hero to “real-size” women who
don’t get on the cover of Vogue. Here is a woman whose show
vigorously promotes Mode Magazine, the fashion alternative to
Vogue that features full-figured women. This is a woman who once
was plus-sized, but was able to drop to the American woman’s
average size of 14. She was like me. She was like a lot of women and
now she has sold out.
In this issue of Vogue, Winfrey has perpetuated the same
stereotype that causes teen-age girls and adult women to diet
constantly and many to suffer eating disorders. She proves that a
woman can possess all the power in the world, but she’s not getting
on the cover o f Vogue unless she loses 20 pounds. She proves that
appearance is the No. 1 discriminating factor for women, white or
black. Unless you fit the stereotype, you do not measure up. It was
sickening to see her there.
It might not have been so painful if it w eren't for the fact that
she looked sick. She looked like a hard, plastic black Barbie doll.
Winfrey posed as if her plumper body had been forced into a mold,
her flesh crushed until it was formed into the ideal. W hat does this
image say to me, a woman who plans to go into the very arena
Winfrey has fought her way through to rule? It tells me that I can be
anything as long as I eventually become 20 pounds lighter.

D on’t m ake eye contact.
Ignore gestures. Get out of their
way.
Good advice if a driver
tailgates you, swerves around
and cuts you off. He doesn’t
know you. Your honor is not at
stake, so you don’t need to lay on
your horn, or yell through your
window.
There is a slow-m oving
driver in front of you. Doesn’t he
know you had a bad day? That
you are late? You let him know
you are not to be toyed with, and
it’s your turn to be a twit. Pass
with a vengeance, sneer, force
him over. Smart, Huh?
But suppose you lose control
of your car, jum p a curb and send
the mailman into outer space.
Picture his bag of letters floating
to earth.
Or suppose you rear end a
truckload o f live chickens.
Chickens burst through their
crates, clucking and pecking in
all directions. The driver leaps
from his truck, waves his fists
and insults your mother. In the
meantime, your headlights are
broken, your radiator belches
steam and you have a backseat
full of chickens and feathers in
your hair.

COLUMN---------continuation from above
In the m agazine, the 20
pounds are talked about as if it is
normal to require celebrities to
reform themselves. Would Time
ask A1 R oker to lose weight
before publishing his photo?
Would publishers make Stone
Phillips develop washboard abs
before he could appear on GQ?
Would N ew sw eek make Ted
Turner get a face lift before
appearing on the cover? Vogue
editors might say it is a fashion
magazine and they want people
to look as beautiful as possible.
But I thought Winfrey was
pretty 20 pounds heavier. Why
did Vogue need to change her?
Why did Vogue feel the need to
reinforce
the
unobtainable
standard of beauty that these
airbrushed, artificial photos
create?
If Winfrey can’t escape the
status quo, can any woman? We
finally see that the champion of
so many women is just “dying”
to be thin — just like the rest of
us. With just one photograph,
someone who told us we could
love ourselves at a size 14 has
proven that we can never really
love ourselves at all.
A picture really is worth a
thousand words.

remember his breaking M aris’
record. I am not saying that
McGwire should or should not
get MVP but I think you are a
little too sure of the fact that Sosa
will get it. The Cardinals didn't
have a great season, but
McGwire is only one player. As
for Sosa leading his team, I
highly doubt that he was solely
responsible for the Cubs making
it to the postseason.
I may not be a Cub fan, but I
have never said the Cubs didn’t
deserve to go to the playoffs. And
for you to say that “it is just like
a Cardinal fan to look for the
negatives out of such a positive
season,” I think you are way out
o f line.
Maybe you are just angry
that Sosa couldn’t beat McGwire.
Sosa is currently a one-season
home
run
hitter,
whereas
McGwire came close with 58 last
year. I am sure you wouldn’t be
having this big fit if Sosa had
beaten McGwire. The distance in
the fields may have given Sosa
an advantage over McGwire
because C hicago’s distance is
shorter than St.Louis’.
So, since you d on't decide
who gets MVP, I guess we will
have to wait until they announce
a winner.

you are not. There are road-rage
situations that could kill you. And
wouldn't you rather live to use
your senior citizen discount than
lie on a steel slab with a toe tag
for identification?
The Illinois State Police are
taking a tough stand against
aggressive driving, speeding,
tailgating and driving under the
influence. They are increasing
patrol cars and seeding highways
with unmarked vehicles. You risk
being arrested, fined and losing
your license.
So ignore the idiot. Don’t
gesture, and give him the whole
road.
Remember,
it
isn’t
personal. You don’t even know
the guy.

A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries
By Stephen W hite

In the latest collaboration between Ismail Merchant and James
Ivory, “A Soldier’s Daughter Never Cries,” a boy becomes a man,
a girl becomes a woman and a father leaves a legacy.
It’s a rare family dram a
about a family without any really
big problems. This story is not
about the “Dysfunctional Family
Robinson” or the “Swiss Family
Robinson.” Nevertheless, in spite
of its lack o f huge traumatic
events to move the plot, it is still
an affecting film.
“A Soldier’s Daughter
Never Cries” is based on Kaylie
Jones’ 1990 semiautobiographical novel o f the
same name. Kaylie Jones’ father,
James Jones, authored “From
Here to Eternity” and “The Thin
Red Line.” Kaylie lived her
childhood through the late ’60s
and early ’70s in both France
and America.
She changed the names for
her novel. The dom inant element
is disillusionment and is still
strong in the characters she so
vividly describes.
Kris Kristofferson plays Bill
Willis, a successful American

writer who decides to move his
American family out of Paris. He
has an adorable young daughter
named Channe (Leelee Sobieski)
and an adopted Parisian son who
he and his wife, M arcella
(Barbara Hershey) name “Billy”
(Jesse Bradford). Billy is only
five when he is adopted by the
fun-loving, frivolous family. The
move will cause some adjusting
to their lifestyle and the
“adjusting” is what this story is
ultimately about.
Each character in this story
is meticulously crafted and
depicted, from the W illis’
fiercely loyal Portuguese nanny.
Candid (Dominique Blanc), to
the young, soon-to-be-gay 15year-old opera singer named
Francis (Anthony Roth
Costanzo) who quickly befriends
Channe but never makes a move
on her until she tells him they’re
moving. This is a family we can
empathize with even though we

C

(which you know will happen all
to soon), the consequences of his
death are strictly a family affair.
Where are his writer-friends
now, a conspicuous movie
watcher might ask.
Above all, “A Soldier’s
Daughter Never Cries” is about
family. Instead of telling the
story of Channe Willis through
her own eyes, like the book, the
movie uses an omniscient point
of view, which seems to dilute
the meaning of the story. The
movie is divided into three
sections: “Billy,” “Channe” and
“Daddy.” The family members
live separate lives but their
actions are linked to each other,
w e’re supposed to believe.
The problem is, there’s no
cohesion.
In the end, this movie is
more likely to make you scratch
your head than shed any tears.
It’s a film that will most likely
have the greatest appeal to fans
of the art-house genre. If you
like these kinds of pointless,
hoity-toity productions then this
film is for you.
“A Soldier’s Daughter
Never Cries” is rated R for

don’t know much about where
they came from or where
they’re going.
The only character in the
film who lacks development is
Marcella. She seems a wee bit
too accepting of her husband’s
numerous vices. She is so
accepting she almost seems
aloof.
Aesthetically, the film is
beautiful in spite o f its almost
total lack of scenic development.
It seems strange that most of the
movie takes place in stuffy
rooms instead of outdoors in the
beautiful streets o f Paris.
Merchant and Ivory, experts at
filming lush period pieces,
should know better.
Maybe the intended effect
was to keep the W illis family in
a bubble. If so, the lack of scenic
development worked beautifully.
W hether they’re in France or
America, the poor kids live their
childhood trapped in a perpetual

state of half-assimilation. Billy is
adorable as a shy young boy who
stares out into the distance, but
when he reaches puberty his
charade is downright disturbing.
He fails to find friends
throughout the movie. His sister
Channe, the young Helen Hunt
look-alike, is appalled by Billy’s
stubborn apathy and judges him
harshly. Her only real friend,
however, is a virtual castaway,
the flamboyant, pretentious
Francis — halfrboy, half-girl, all
attitude.
It seems that even the father
and mother are separated from
their environment, even though
they hold numerous “writers’
parties” in their Paris apartment
and on the beaches of Long
Island. The entertainment —
card playing, quick-witted
literary talk that seems as hollow
as the people who mindlessly
spew it out and non-stop social
drinking — is conducted on a
purely artificial level among a
group of people in which each
individual is more concerned
about his or her own self than
the well-being of the group.

RAV€S
BY COREY STIJLCE
W R IT E R ATT.ARC,F

At first, my mother thought I
was just trying to stir up some
controversy and be different, as
usual. But eventually, after
countless questions and heart-toheart chats, she came to terms
with it.
It’s been about six months
now since I told my mother I
thought I was gay.
On Sunday, Oct. 11, people
will be celebrating National
Coming Out Day, and for the first
time in my 23 years, I can happily
celebrate with them. Nearly
everyone important in my life,
family and friends, knows about
me now. And, I do have to say, I
have had it fairly easy, with little
to no adversity.
I even found it surprising
when people I had been close to
for years said things like “I’ve
known that about you forever.”
Well, thanks for sharing, because
I sure didn’t. I was in denial
about my sexuality for years, and
I really thought the only ones
who might suspect it were the
girls with whom I had awkward
attempts at relationships. For a
long time, I felt like the
redheaded, bastard child with a
bad lisp at a Kennedy family
reunion. I wasn’t sure if I could
be true to myself, much less those
around me.
Now usually I reserve this
space in the newspaper to discuss
very inane things dealing with
pop culture or whatever seems to
be curling my toes the wrong
way. But I thought it was
important for me to dedicate this
column to the topic at hand.
It’s partly for me. This feels
like the final step for me to
completely step out of the closet.
After this hits the stands, my co­
w orkers, peers, readers and
possibly transients on the street
will know about me. A friend of
mine used to participate in an
event on Coming Out Day where
he told seven strangers that he
was gay. So I’m feasibly telling a
few thousand.
I also feel like I’m doing it for
those out there who have
apprehensions. There are many
people, even on the campus, who
are firmly shoved deep back in
the closet w ith last season’s
“South Park” T-shirts. And
maybe if they see some crazy-ass
like m yself w illing to let the
campus know, then maybe it will
help them m uster up some
courage.
I realize how difficult it is. It
took me a long time to actually
say, “Yes, I am gay.” I hedged for
a long, long time. I said things
like, “I might be curious about
this” or “I think I might be
bisexual.” In my mind, I thought
there might have been something
wrong with me. But I am lucky,
lucky to have support from my
family and friends and lucky to
have such a high self-concept.

T h e

I realize I may be opening
myself up to criticism by doing
this in such a public manner.
Even though being gay is slowly
becoming more accepted, gay
people are still ridiculed and
demeaned every day and their
issues are swept under the carpet
like so many dust bunnies. I don’t
plan on being an activist, but I
also do not plan on hiding from it
either. I have always been one to
speak my mind and I am willing
to fight to keep my honor and
dignity, no matter what.
I have heard all the arguments
against gay people, and how they
are immoral, and of course, I’ve
heard the Bible thing. I realize
that this campus is quite often
close minded as a whole, and
many people are from small
towns and have not dealt with
gay people.
But whether they know it or
not, everyone know s a gay
person. Yes, even you. Some
people might not realize it, but
there is a very good chance there
is someone important in their life
who is gay, be it a good friend or
family member, who is afraid to
come out and openly discuss their
true sexuality. They are crying
out for support that they cannot
find from their loved ones. And
as uncomfortable as it may be for
someone to accept them, it is
twice as hard for them to live
with such an all-consum ing
secret. People should not have to
hide something that is completely
natural to them and that is a part
of their being. I did it for a long
time, and it was painful.
I don’t think coming out has
changed me. I am still the same
wacky, irreverent fellow I have
always been. I don’t want to be
treated differently on campus
now that I am out. I have always
felt comfortable here, and I don’t
plan on it changing. I don’t want
whispers behind my back or
cowardly, anonymous hate mail. I
don’t fear harassment; I don’t
have any room for it in my life. I
am w illing to talk in a civil
manner to anyone who might
disagree with my opinions. That’s
the journalist in me.
I know some people feel very
strongly against homosexuality.
But I am not here to hurt anyone.
I am here to live my life the only
way I feel truly happy. And that is
really
all
anyone
wants.
Acceptance. A cceptance from
their peers and friends, no matter
what their orientation might be.
I get so tired o f m eeting
people who are afraid to talk to
their friends and family about
their sexuality, instead they are
forced to go to strangers. I hope
that this has maybe opened a few
eyes and at least made one person
rethink treatment of those who
are different.
Ariel I really hope I can help at
least one person to start to find
the courage to make that journey
out of the closet. It isn’t an easy
one, I know. But just telling one
person you care about will make
all the difference. Living with
the anticipation can be much
worse than knowing the truth
about whether or not acceptance
will occur.
I am willing to talk to anyone
who has any concerns. No, I’m
not a counselor, but I have an
open mind and I like to listen.

“A fter this last m eet I feel we have m ade good prog ression ,”
F re rk e r said. “T he first half of th e season is stre n g th and
conditioning fo r the second half. I really w asn’t h ap py until this
last m eet.”
F re rk e r said h e b e lie v e s his ru n n e rs sh o w ed a lo t o f
im provem ent in th e m e e t this w eekend. H e believes his strengths
on the w o m en’s side are experience and leadership b ecau se th ey
are an older group.
O n the m e n ’s side, how ever, is a very young, yet ta le n te d group
with four freshm en finishing in th e to p six on Sunday.
F rerk er said he is looking tow ard R ibes and S tan d erfer, along
with anyone else w ho is willing to step up to th e challenge, to help
carry his squad in to th e regionals.
T he next m e e t fo r the S IU E C ougars will be S atu rd ay against
W ashington U niversity. This will be the last m eet b e fo re the
conference m eet on Saturday, O ct. 24.

“ I ’ll do w h a t it ta k e s to win. I ’m p re p a re d to w in,”
H ard im o n said.
O th e r players to look for are freshm an Kelly W ohltm an and
sen io rs E ric a C onw ay, A n n C o lter, S onya W o h ltm a n a n d
M argaret Bear.
“These players c reate a good team with a lot o f d ep th ,”
Logan said.
C onsidering th a t the plan for this w eekend is to get throu gh
the early rounds using d o ub le com binations, the C ougars should
play a significant role at th e GLVC.
The com bo of A m y N agle (ran ked fo u rth in the n a tio n last
year at Springfield C ollege in Illinois) and G re tc h e n D eL an ey
m ay m ake an im pact.
T he team has p erfo rm ed well so far and is psyched to get the
job done.
“They try really h a rd and th at m akes the d ifference,” L ogan
said. “N o rth e rn K entucky is really good. We m ay pull an upset.
E ith e r way, I ’m p ro u d o f them this season. I ’m ju st th e re p attin g
them on th e back.”
