E d ito r’s Note: SIUE police
recently issued the annual report
on crime. Reported crimes such
as burglary, theft and assault
totaled 203 in 1997. That
compares to 193 in 1996 and 335
in 1995. The largest single
category o f crime in all years is
theft, follow ed by vehicular
break-ins. There were 64 arrests
on campus last year compared to
95 in 1996.
The information that follows
was
collected
by
m ass
comm unications students who
interviewed classm ates and
friends on campus.
Students who live on the
campus are concerned with their
safety even though the latest
report shows that crim e is
declining.
Parking and long walks to
cars at night are major concerns
among students interviewed.
Jennifer Ball, a 21-year-old
nursing major from Addison,
worries about getting around at
night. “I have to park my car
really far away from my night
classes, and
I feel
very
uncomfortable walking through
the parking lot alone. No one is
around, so it would be really easy
to get mugged or hurt because no
one is there to help,” she said.
Another student who shared
B all’s
concern
is
Ryan
Boosinger, a 20-year-old theater
perform ance
major
from
Springfield.
“You have to park too far
away from your classes at night.
They should allow night parking
behind Founders’ and Alumni
Hall,” he said.
Angie Carreras, 18, o f Park
Forest, lives on campus in the
new residence facility, Prairie
Hall.
“I have no real concerns, but
I am a little afraid to walk by
myself at night, “ she said.

A little history lesson on the SIUE mascot
BY LISAGULICK
NEWS STRINGER
The well-known cougar
mascot of Southern Illinois
University Edwardsville has a
lively, but little-known past.
On July 31, 1967, SIUE held
an official election to decide what
the mascot would be. Originally,
there were five nominations: the
Pioneer, Eagle, Ranger, Titan and
Cougar. Through a democracy of
student votes, the choices were
reduced to either Titan or Cougar.
To select a final mascot, a
second election resulted in 1,446
votes for Titan and 5,285 votes for
Cougar. The Cougar became the
official mascot in October 1967.
The
cougar
got
its
nomination as mascot because,
during the early construction of
SIUE, a construction worker
claimed to have seen a cougar on
the campus.
The cougar did once inhabit
the state of Illinois, but no valid
sightings have been reported in
the recent past. The cougar does
possess many honorable qualities,
which constitutes its worthiness
as an SIUE mascot.
“Among the cougar’s most
promising characteristics are

grace,
movement,
strength,
stamina and endurance ... The
cougar is compelled by nature to
live within the exercises of the
talents with which he is endowed.
Being a wild animal, the cougar,
oddly enough, seeks the society of
man,” according to a 1967 Alestle
article.
SIUE once housed two live
cougar mascots. From 1968 to
1985,
the
female
cougar,
Chimaga, was the official mascot.
Chimaga belonged to a man
in Houston who was killed in a
plane crash. The University of
Houston became aware of SIUE’s
desire to obtain a live mascot and
informed the mother of the
deceased man. The mother
volunteered the cub to the
university.
Initially, the cub’s name was
Danielle, but SIUE officials
thought the name did not
adequately
characterize
the
school. A contest was held to find
a more suitable name for the new
mascot. Mary Ann Kucinick, a
1970 graduate, won the contest
with the suggestion of utilizing
the American Indian word for
cougar, Chimaga.
Chimaga was caged in the
rear of the University Center at
SIUE and benevolently cared for
by an organized group of students.

On one particular occasion,
Chimaga was brought to an SIUE
soccer game to encourage team
spirit.
Chimaga’s reign at SIUE was
a long and cherished one. She
remained the mascot here for 17
years, until March 18, 1985, when
she died of old age.
In commemoration of her
importance to SIUE, Chimaga
was buried behind Alumni Hall,
beside a small tree near the pond.
At the base of the tree is a
tombstone.
Chimaga was not the only
live mascot at SIUE. In July of
1982 yet another cougar, Kyna,
became an official mascot of
SIUE. Kyna, however, was
considerably more feisty and
dangerous than Chimaga. The
insurance liability had greatly
escalated and her cage needed
repair, but no money had been
volunteered. After only five years
at SIUE, Kyna was sent away to a
Wildlife Preserve in Southern
Illinois near Metropolis.
SIUE may no longer possess
a live mascot, but it does own four
stuffed cougars. Collector Milton
Harrington donated them to SIUE
along with thousands of other
various items, but the stuffed
cougars are locked away in a
storage room.

Lovejoy Library recently
added 7,000 periodicals to its
collection without adding a
single shelf.
New databases and two new
interfaces to the ILL1NET system
are just some of the new things
added to the library.
ILLINET is the online
catalog system that allows users
to search for books in the 45
member libraries of the Illinois
Library
Com puter
Systems
Organization.
ILSCO will let users request
books from other libraries
without filling out paperwork
and check on the status of their
requests. The system will even
let users know if they have any
overdue books or fines. Lovejoy
Library officials said the index is
expected to soon add periodicals
and government publications.
There are two new interfaces
to the ILLINET. The first way of
seeing the data is through a telnet
session. This has been revamped
and menus have been added. The
second interface is from the
World Wide Web. The WWW
interface isn’t fully functional
yet, but as services are expanded
it will become the primary access
method,
Lovejoy
Library
officials said.
There are several ways to
access the new system . It is
available at workstations at the
library. Access can also be gained
through the Web at any of the
computers on campus. The Web
address is http://www.library.
siue.edu /ioannounce.html. Users
may also start a telnet session at
http://www.pac.iIcso.uiuc.edu.
In addition to the catalog,
the SIUE library offers a wide
variety of electronic resources.
Rather than storing periodicals
and journals on paper or
m icrofiche, many are storing
them
in databases.
Some
databases have just an abstract of
the article; others have the full
text.

CRIME--------------from page 1
This was a common theme
among many SIUE students.
Stephanie Arbogast, a sophomore
civil engineering major from
Granite City commutes to
classes.
She
agreed
with
Carreras, also saying that she
feels safe on campus, but at
nighttime she doesn’t like to walk
by herself.
“The crime is lower than I
expected, but then again, I guess,
it is pretty tame around here,“ she
said after reading the crime
report.
Parking at Cougar Village is
another problem for students.
Robin Judy, a 19-year-old
from Danville lives in Cougar
Village.
“In Cougar Village at night,
when I’m walking from my car,
it’s awful. The parking lots aren’t
big enough, and I can’t park near
my apartment,” Judy said.
“Cougar Village could be a
lot safer. The sliding glass door in
my apartment doesn’t lock, and
we don’t have the stop blocks to
put behind the doors like w e’re
supposed to,” Stephanie Walker
said. “The parking at Cougar
Village is bad. There are not
enough spots for everyone, so
you have to park far away from
your building. This makes it
easier for someone to break into
your car,” she said.

Many of the databases are
general in nature, including
periodicals and journals from
different areas, but there are
many
databases
that
are
specialized.
There are 54
databases currently available, 10
of which are new.
“The databases available on
our system are sources that are
authoritative
and
would
otherwise not be available to the
casual web surfer,” director of

15, 1998 +

Bouse,
20,
both
from
Collinsville, have a major
concern.
While some students are
concerned, others feel safe.
Janine Kleeman, 18, from
Staunton said she has no safety
concerns whatsoever.
Shaun Heidke, an 18-yearold theater major from Worden
had the same response.” I have
no safety concerns on campus,”
he said.
Theft, although it has
declined in recent years, is also of
great concern for some students.
Craig Evans, a 17-year-old
freshman from Decatur said he is
not concerned about crime.
Evans sum m ed up the safety
situation at SIUE:
“ Most students agree that
this is a pretty safe campus. Just
make sure you have a friend
along with you when walking at
night and protect your personal
belongings and you’ll be all right.
It’s better to be safe than sorry.”
Campus safety is not only a
concern for students, but for
faculty.
Kathy Haberer is a reading
and study skills instructor from
Highland. When asked if she was
concerned about her safety on
campus, Haberer replied, “No.
But I do lock my office door even
if I step out for a second.” The
office that is now hers was
burglarized a few years ago, she
said.

User Services Charlotte Johnson
said. Many o f the sources
available require subscriptions
for which the library pays
thousands of dollars.
Many o f these databases
change and may look different
the next time users log in, so the
library is preparing on-line
tutorials which will change as the
databases change.
“ Electronic resources are
changing daily. We offer classes
to keep you up to date,” Johnson
said. Check the library for an
updated schedule of classes.

Country of the lowest common denominator
I tried to avoid
it, I really did. But it’s
worse than the O.J.
trial. It seems to be
everyw here, and I
Danielle guess I can no longer
Belton ingore the issue.
I couldn’t avoid the Starr
Report if I tried. It hit the
Midwest like the Holy Ghost.
News outlets jum ped on the
chance to report on the hotest
new soap opera of the season. All
this, and w e’ve never even heard
Monica utter a word on the
subject.
Personally, I ’m one of the 60
percent who would like to see the
whole m atter dropped, but I
know that’s not going to happen.
It’s funny and all to laugh at the
supermarket tabloid headlines,
but sometimes it’s been hard to
tell the difference between them
and the Post-Dispatch. One
tabloid’s headline read, “Tell Bill
I’m sorry” and “I’ve ruined the
man I love,” with a picture of a
sullen
M onica
Lewinsky.
Another told of M onica’s secret
abortion heartbreak. Far-fetched
as these stories may seem, the
national news doesn’t do much
better. I really didn’t need to
know about that stained dress,
and I really, really didn’t want to
know what they did with that
cigar that both CBS and NBC
told me about.
I’m really tired of it and
unlike some who blame one side
and not the other, I blame them
all. I blame Bill C linton for
listening to the wrong part of his
anatomy, I blam e M onica
Lewinsky for chasing a married
man, I blame the Republicans for
being so zealous about the whole
thing, I blame the Democrats for
being so pensive and I blame
Kenneth Starr for writing out 400
pages of it. This is the stupidest
waste of time and space I’ve ever
witnessed. There are children
dying in the streets and people in
this country who still live in
houses without plum bing and

everyone is all up in arms about
this tawdy piece of supermarket
romance trash.
I’m not in love with Bill
Clinton, but I did vote for the
man. He is walking, talking
proof that anyone in this country
could be president if they put
their mind to it. He was bom
poor, his m other’s been married
five times and his father was a
drunk. It’s a miracle he didn’t
just end up another panelist on
the Jerry Springer Show. One
twist of fate and you can go from
being to lowest
common
denominator of American society
to leader of the free world. Some
would argue that Bill Clinton is
now both, but after reading his
life history, wasn’t he always?
The saddest part is that
many conservative writers and
commentators appear to be so
happy about this. It’s like one big
“ I told you so” party. As if
watching someone ruin their life
is something to relish in. Sure,
many people feign pity and
interest for the first lady and her
family, but they liked her and
Chelsea about as much as they
liked the president. Hillary was
often painted as a “femi-nazi”
and I remember a lot of
comparisons with Chelsea and
Buddy, the White House dog.
Maybe I would get upset if
polititians didn’t already have a
reputation for lying, covering up
things and chasing women. I’m
not condoning it; I’d like it if we
had some politicians that tell the
truth, but they’d never get
elected. People hate being told
the truth when it’s bad. How
many people would vote for a
man who got up and said, “Well,
if you elect me it will be hard to
get bills passed because I have
too many enemies throughout the
opposition, but with some
careful lobbying I might be able
to raise some funds for my party
so I can run again to encounter
the same gridlock next time
Congress is in session." We’re a

This WWWeek

BY JULIE ALBL

LIFESTYLE STRINGER
Just a few short months
ago, Extreme radio came to St.
Louis. The station booted
“Alice” out of her short-lived
position on the dial (104.1 FM)
and played everything from
Black Sabbath to early
Metallica; many songs never
before heard on mainstream
radio. Fans applauded the
station’s willingness to play
heavier music that w ouldn’t
receive much air time otherwise.
A recent promotion
implemented by the station is
the “Low Dough Show” — a
$1.04 music concert featuring
local and national bands. “Low
Dough Show Numero Uno” was
a small flop for the station that
had caused such a stir.
A small crowd showed; the
under-21 section and the floor
were practically empty
compared to other shows at
Mississippi Nights. Still, the bar
areas were fairly full, giving the
impression that an older
audience was attracted to the
station’s events.
The main band o f the
evening was Drain STH, four
hard-rocking females from
Stockholm, Sweden. Extreme
“talent” Woody introduced the
band and alerted us to the fact
that, although the band was
female, this w asn’t the Lilith
Fair. Extreme has played their

catchy single, “Crack the Liar’s
Smile,” on heavy rotation for
weeks. Their set on the second
stage at 1997’s Ozzfest tour in
St. Louis was exciting and
received good audience attention
for an unknown band. But their
performance at the “Low Dough
Show” was different.
The music was good, but
their tempo was strange
throughout the set. Nearly every
song was performed at a very
fast pace. A few were dragged
out, such as the radio hit “Crack
the Liar’s Smile.”
St. Louis band Full On
Venus performed a dull set. Not
only was their sound board not
run well (bass drum and guitar
could not be heard throughout
half the show), but the music
was boring. They seemed as
though they were trying to be
something they weren’t,
although it was hard to tell what.
Three members took turns
singing during what seemed to
be a never-ending set.
Performing before Full On
Venus was Southern Illinois’ Eli
Stone. Lots of screaming and
jumping (by the band) paired
with heavy guitar riffs and loud
music bred a relatively small
mosh pit during their first song.
Hopefully, future “ Low
Dough Shows” will be better.
“ Low Dough Show Number
Two” will be held Sunday at
Mississippi Nights. Local bands
Purge and Mesh will open for
the Mayfield Four.

The m o m en tu m seem ed to be in S lU E ’s favor, b u t a
heartbreaking e rro r tu rn e d the tide in the 74th m inute. A n
attem p ted clearing kick by the SIU E defense deflected off a
C harleston forw ard and past C ougar goalkeeper C hris Koenig to
tie the game.
The Cougars failed to regroup and allowed C harleston to take
the lead less than four m inutes later. S IU E couldn’t m anage
an o th er shot on goal the rest o f the contest and suffered a 2-1
loss.
“We w ere up against a good team and we hung with them ,”
H uneke said. “We just can ’t get down on ourselves after we let up
a goal. We have to stabilize ourselves physiologically.”

forw ard m otion, so it’s graceful. It is very relaxing and com forting
to the body.”
R acew alking is a sp o rt th a t can be learned at any age o r any
fitness level. “A nyone at any age can do this sp o rt,” P locher said.
“ It’s good exercise, it’s fun and it’s great for your posture.”
People participate in racew alking for a variety of reasons: for
fitness, for health o r com petitive reasons. “ It really d ep en d s on
the goals of the individual and how m uch tim e they are willing to
put into it,” Plocher said.
If perform ance is yo u r thing, there are m any com petitive
events held in the St. L ouis area. “ Every m onth you can go to a
race,” Plocher said. “ R aces can be used for goal setting. A n d your
chances of w inning are b e tte r than in runs because th e re are
fewer participants.”
Goals, training habits and pro p er w alking techniques are
topics th at will be covered at the sem inar. Walk M asters and Co.

The cost o f the sem inar is $45 o r $40 for m em bers o f the
