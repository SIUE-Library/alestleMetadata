Students get fit with aerobics
■ BY AMANDA BARTON
NEWS STRINGER
If you have ever been to the Student
Fitness Center here on campus, you may
already know that there are many different
ways that students can choose to exercise.
There is a weight room, basketball and
racquetball courts, a pool and an indoor
track. Yet the aerobics room on the second
floor has been impossible to miss lately.
It has been impossible to miss because
of the increasing popularity of aerobics as
a way for students to get and remain fit.
Every weeknight many students crowd in
the wooden floored, mirrored room and
wait for the next aerobics class to start. If
you walk by this room you may see
punches being thrown into the air, legs

kicking high and strong, sweat pouring
from every face in the room and the music
is always blasting loudly.
The Student Fitness Center offers
both low and high' intensity aerobic
workouts and videotapes are also available
for students who would rather exercise
privately. H owever the high intensity
aerobic classes taught by Tina Kassa have
proven to be very popular with students at
SIUE. Her classes include aeroboxing,
aerobic-funk, boot camp aerobics, and step
aerobics. Each one of the workouts often
includes advanced abdominal workouts as
well as push-ups.
Although most people who attend the
classes are young women, there are
usually several men in each class, as well
as older adults.
Tina Kassa started teaching aerobics
at SIUE’s Student Fitness Center eight
years ago. She was discovered by her
current employer who, after observing
Kassa participating in an aerobics class,
asked her if she would be interested in
teaching. Kassa accepted the position and
has taught aerobics ever since. She also
teaches at the YMCA, Leisure World in
C ollinsville and teaches the ROTC
students on Saturday mornings. However,
before she began teaching, Kassa became
certified as an aerobics instructor by the
Aerobics and Fitness A ssociation of
America. W hen asked about her future
plans, Kassa states, “I ’ll probably teach
here until I die or they throw me out.”
“This is my fourth year at SIUE and
I ’ve been attending Tina’s classes for three
years,” Shana Lee, a senior, said. “She’s
the best aerobics teacher I’ve ever been

to.” Lee says she goes twice a week to help
tone her muscles and says she is impressed
with the results she has seen.
Dena Cuppett, who attends aerobics
three times a week, says that working out
is her way of relieving stress after a long
day of classes, work and studying. “I have
seen the kind o f results I wanted to,”
Cuppett said. She explained that since she
began going to aerobics her eating habits
have improved and she has felt much
better about herself.
According to the Women in Sport and
Physical Activity Journal, aerobic dance
exercise has been shown to improve self­
esteem. Also, sporting activities such as
aerobics allows participants to experience
their bodies as strong and powerful.
Kassa states that in just one of her
aerobics workouts, depending on how hard

a participant works, they can bum up to
900 calories in one hour. The only other
activity that bums that many is running for
one hour. Driving for one hour bums 120
calories, walking briskly burns 210
calories, swimming for an hour bums 300
calories and playing basketball burns 500
calories. It is obvious then that aerobics
can definitely be an effective way to keep
in shape.
Although many students on campus
feel that being in shape and staying healthy
are very important, there are those who do
not. Anne Hamel, a junior, says she does
not see the point in trying to exercise.
“You can’t fight your genetics, all you
have to do is look at your parents and
grandparents to see how you’re going to
turn out,” she said.

LASO makes students feel at home while making a difference

The

Organization
President
(LASO),
a
o f LASO
s t u d e n t
organization that helps to promote
Hispanic culture and awareness of
Latino issues to the entire student
body, is only in it’s first year of
existence at SIUE, and has over 30
active members.
LASO was started in spring of
1997 by several students who were
interested in sharing the Spanish

language and the Hispanic culture
among themselves and with others.
“Most people don’t know
about other cultures,” Eduardo
Poeliniz, a sophomore at SIUE and
historian
for
LASO
said.
According to Poeliniz, the goal of
LASO is to help others expand
their horizons culturally.
To help achieve this goal,
LASO has created a full calendar
of social and cultural events,
including a Spanish conversation
hour, Latin dance lessons and
service projects. The students
involved in LASO also help to
plan International Week and
Springiest on the SIUE campus.
“These students have such
positive energy,” Dr. Elizabeth
Fonseca said. “The students are

what make LASO so special and
unique.” She, along with Dr.
Alison Lamothe, is faculty advisor
for the organization.
The students involved also see
LASO as a positive addition to
their community.
“LASO is like a home away
from home,” Juan Rosa, a
freshman at SIUE and historian for
LASO said. “It’s like a family for
us.”
According to all the officers
of LASO, attending LASO
meetings is, in many ways, similar
to a family reunion.
“We really understand each
other and we’ve formed a bond,”
Violeta Garza, president of LASO
and a freshman said. “We are all
very close.”

“We have such strength and
friendship,” Vice-president Clarisa
Medina,
a
junior
at
SIUE said.
Indeed, the organization is
made up of close-knit students, but
they are most welcoming to
newcomers who are interested in
LASO and what it has to offer.
“LASO is made up of
many students of different
backgrounds,” Medina said. “It’s
very diverse and everyone
is welcome.”
In addition to social events,
LASO is also actively involved in
community service, particularly
with the Hispanic community of
the greater St. Louis area.
Currently LASO members work
with young Hispanic students in

Fairmont City as part of a
mentoring program and another
mentoring program is in the works
for next year.
The members of the SIUE
chapter of LASO also attend
various LASO events at other
schools in the St. Louis area,
including Washington University
and St. Louis University and in
April the students are planning to
attend the Latin Film Conference
in Chicago.
LASO’s goal at this time is
working to improve the quality of
cultural programming here at
SIUE as well as growing
organizationally.
“We are really working to be
known
in
the
university
community,” Garza said.

Step into the 1800s with the University Museum Art Gallery
■ BY BOB FEHRINGER
PHOTO EDITOR
If you think there’s nothing new to do around campus, try stopping
by the University Museum Art Gallery in the University Center and take
a giant step into the past.
“Stepping Out With My Baby,” a display of clothing from the 1800s,
will be on display for the remainder of the month.
A majority of the collection belongs to Jack Smith, the costume
designer with the department of theater and dance. A few pieces are
property of the department.
According to Smith the exhibit features only women’s clothing
because very few m en’s clothing has survived over the years. “Men were
a lot harder on their clothes and wore them every day,” Smith said. “So
they didn’t last as long as the clothing we have displayed here, which was
usually worn on special occasions.”
The dresses cover the period from 1827 to 1902 and are original
with only minor restorations to the original material.
So, if you ever wondered what an early American wedding dress
looked like or wondered how actresses dressed on stage in the 1880s,
stop by and relive a bit of American history.
Hours of the exhibit are: M onday-closed, Tuesday through Friday,
10 am to 4:30 pm, Saturday and Sunday, 1 pm to 3 pm. For more
information call 692-2996.

Don’t be shy, physics won’t hurt you
Now that the eagles are
making a comeback, I would like
to find a way to put the physics
major on the endangered species
list. O f the fifty people, more or
less, on my class roster for
University Physics, the number
who list themselves as majoring
in physics is zip, nada, none at
all. There must be a reason.
I can hear everybody
laughing at this dummy who
doesn’t seem to realize that
physics is too dam hard. But the
basic course is just as hard for all
the chemists, math majors and
engineers who grumble some, yet

manage to pass anyway. So we
really are talking about the
junior-senior physics courses.
People really don’t have to be
smarter for physics than for many
other majors. Is it the job market?
I will admit that there are some
potential
employers
whose
attitude is, “Physicist? No, I don’t
need any atoms split.” Who,
besides Dilbert, would want to
work for anyone that ignorant?
The laws of physics underlie
everything, not just atoms, so
physics people are generalists
who like to work from first
principles. That makes them slow

on routine projects, but great on
oddball
ones.
A lso,
first
principles never (well - hardly
ever) go out o f date. Any
company that employs a halfdozen or more engineers likely
needs a physicist or two, but it
might take some convincing.
Anyway, who says that a
physics major has to work as a
physicist? Physics is a pretty
good background for medicine,
music theory, financial analysis
or about anything else. (One of
our graduates m anages the
airport at Bethalto.) I can’t think
of any career doors which are

closed to physics majors.
Several, from across the nation
were or are astronauts and the
leading money winner among
professional bowlers majored
in physics.
Maybe there’s a social
problem. Do you have to be a
nerd? Or ugly? Or male? Some of
us are all the above, but it’s
definitely not required. Sally
Ride, for example, is none of the
above. There aren’t as many
women or minorities in physics
as there should be, but the
ones who are seem to do
extremely well.

I
think the problem comes
down to a matter of self-image.
Not many people can see
themselves in the same business
as Einstein, Bohr, Fermi or
Heisenberg. Thankfully there’s
plenty o f room for us lesser
types. All that’s really needed is
ordinary intelligence and perhaps
extraordinary curiosity about
how the world works.
So don’t be shy, but when
you come to sign up, please don’t
cut in line.

Com m entary------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The media needs to dig deep to regain the public’s trust
What a difference a week
makes. Last week most of the
Sunday morning pundits were
talking about the number o f days
left in the Clinton presidency.
The words “President Gore” were
used. This week the story is being
pushed out of the lead in favor of
the approaching Iraq War.
Most voters seem to accept
the president’s behavior. Those
same voters do not accept the
press
coverage.
Television
reports the two loudest public
anthems are: 1. “I voted the Dow
Jones not Paula Jones,” 2. “What
consenting adults do in private is
their business.”
We are entering an extremely
dangerous period. The public has,
since the death o f President
Kennedy, been skeptical of
politicians. They have come to
rely on the press for learning the
“truth.” They have leaned
especially hard on electronic
media since many people do not
read. The recently released
movie, “Wag the Dog,” expresses

that dangerous situation far more
elegantly than this commentary
could ever hope to express.
The theme of the movie is
that what is said on television
defines what is real. If television
says there is a war, there is war. If
they say the war is over, it’s over.
People accept these “realities”
without question. That movie is
cynical and made me very angry.
Yet, in the light of the real
Clinton crises, the theme of that
movie is being tested.
W hat editors and news
directors are finding is that the
people are not accepting the
media version of reality. The
public wants little to do with the
current “Clinton roast.” To most
Americans it is unseemly. They
are uncomfortable and want
things to be safely the way they
were.
People generally still have
low trust in political leaders.
Now that they are discounting the
press’ opinion, they have no one
from
whom

information can be obtained. Is
that what the press wants, to be
discounted? I don’t think so.
To regain the trust of readers
and viewers, the press must
return to a more evenhanded
style. Quit the rush to judgement.
Take the time necessary to
research stories. Give the people
what they need more often than
what they seem to want.
There are so many stories
that never make the papers or
onto television news because
editors and news directors
underestimate the people’s ability
to understand a complex story.
They would rather go for money
making stories which appeal to a
large audience’s basest instincts.
They especially want to excite
the ow ner’s accountants.
The press can teach people
what they missed in school about
politics, econom ics and good
manners. Most people have no
idea that there is a big difference
between the national debt and the
deficit. There has been little

discussion of the massive
unfunded debt faced by the
nation in the years shortly
following the year 2000. When
the president crows about how
small
he
has
made
the
government, few in the press
point out that most of the
decrease came from cuts in
military personnel. At a time
when we may need a strong
m ilitary to defend A m erica’s
national interests as well as our
borders, it has been cut to the
bone. W hen I interview ed the
form er
C hief
of
Naval
Operations, Adm. Carlisle Trost,
he told me that Am erican
warships are so short of non­
nuclear missiles that on many
ships there is only one reload per
tube. Why hasn’t the press taught
the public what that means?
The press is in a bad
position. Owners who have more
loyalty to profit than to truth have
control of the printing press and
the TV studio. There are people
who work in news that know

what they are supposed to do.
They just don’t want to get fired
for doing it. I will remind them of
their colleagues in the former
Soviet Union who had more to
lose than a job. At a critical
moment they chose to report the
truth and allowed a process of
political transformation to occur.
We, in the United States, are
about to move through a critical
period in our social and political
history. President Clinton is only
the tip of that iceberg. Without
trust in the press the people will
have no place to turn to at that
critical moment for correct,
usable inform ation. Actually,
there is one other place they
might turn, to a strongman who
will promise order in place of
liberty.
W hat’s it going to be?

Latest AIDS statistics dramatize stunning turnaround
CH ICA G O (A P) — The
stunning turnaround in the war on
AIDS has become even more
obvious with the latest national
statistics - deaths from the
disease fell almost in half during
the first half o f last year.
The figures released Monday
show that a smaller downturn in
1996 was no fluke. The decline in
AIDS deaths is accelerating.
Experts agree that the
improvement is caused almost
entirely
by
pow erful
combinations of m edicines that
first came into widespread use
less than two years ago. Almost
immediately, they changed AIDS
from a death sentence to a
chronic illness - at least for now.
M any
quietly
wonder,
though, how long this will last.
Will people who were rescued
from what seemed like certain
death continue to thrive? Or will
the virus eventually find a way to
elude the drugs that thwart it?
“Are we in a honeym oon
period? Is there something bad on
the horizon?” asked Dr. Harold
Jaffe o f the U.S. C enters for

Disease Control and Prevention.
D espite his apprehension,
nothing in the C D C ’s figures
foretell even a hint of gloom. The
news is stunningly good.
Deaths from AIDS peaked in
1994 and 1995, then nosed
downward 21 percent in 1996.
Last year, that fall accelerated.
The latest CDC figures show
that 12,040 Americans died of
AIDS in the first half of last year,
down 44 percent from the 21,460
deaths in the first half of 1996.
Experts said this does not
mean that AIDS is no longer a
problem. The virus continues to
spread and between 400,000 and
650,000 Americans are infected.
However, the disease is far
different than it was even just
three or four years ago.
“We can’t see the end of the
epidemic, but it’s the beginning
of a new era,” said the CD C’s Dr.
Kevin DeCock.
Prescriptions o f so-called
three-drug cocktails - two older
AIDS drugs plus one of the
newer class of medicines called
protease
inhibitors
have

revolutionized
AIDS
care.
Typically people start on them
as soon as they learn they are
infected, even before they
get sick.
When all goes well, these
medicines drive the amount of
virus in the bloodstream so low
that it cannot be measured.
Many who were deathly ill
when the combination therapy
came into widespread use two
years ago are now in outwardly
good health.
Still, the drugs fail for some,
and the most common reason is
that people stop taking the
medicines. Patients must swallow
20 or so pills a day on a precise
time schedule; missing even a
few can allow mutant unkillable
strains to emerge in the body.
The total nationwide figures
for last year will not be tallied
until July. However, they are
already in for New York City home to 16 percent of all U.S.
AIDS cases - and they show an
even more impressive change.
Experts from the city ’s
Department of Health reported

that AIDS deaths there fell 48
percent in 1997. This comes on
top of a 29 percent decline in
New York AIDS deaths in 1996.
The New York data show
that both men and women and
people
of
all
races
are
benefiting from the lifesaving
breakthroughs
in
AIDS
treatment.
“We didn’t see a big decline
in women a year ago. The good
news is this year, they are
beginning to catch up,” said Dr.
Mary Ann Chiasson of the New
York City department.
About 100,000 New Yorkers
have had AIDS and 65,000 have
died of the disease. In 1995, there
was 19 AIDS deaths per day in
New York. Last year, that had
fallen to seven.
Between 1995 and 1997,
AIDS deaths in the city have
declined 71 percent among men
and 63 percent among women.
Among women during this time,
they fell 73 percent among
whites, 66 percent among
H ispanics and 59 percent
among blacks.

The new treatments are also
credited with keeping HIVinfected people well so they do
not develop full-blown AIDS.
Nationwide,
the
CDC
reported that the num ber of new
AIDS cases diagnosed in the first
six months o f 1997 fell 12
percent. With fewer dying, the
number of Americans living with
AIDS is increasing, up 13 percent
to 259,000.
Also Monday, the American
Academy of Pediatrics said the
governm ent should start a
nationwide program to track the
hundreds of babies bom each
year with the AIDS virus.
Doctors now are required
only
to
report
full-blow n
childhood AIDS to government
health officials, not childhood
HIV infections, said a statement
in the February issue of
academy’s journal, Pediatrics.
The latest estimate for the
number of infants born annually
with HIV infections was 1,600.
The academy em phasized that
the identity of the infants and
their m others m ust be kept
confidential.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A
van carrying Monica Lewinsky and
her family was rear-ended Friday
by a car driven by an Associated
Press Television newsman. No one
was seriously injured.
The accident occurred about
4:20 p.m. on the rain-slickened San
Diego Freeway as about a halfdozen media vehicles were
following the Lewinsky minivan to
lawyer William Ginsburg’s home
in the San Fernando Valley.
The Dodge Caravan, driven by
Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, was struck
from behind while slowing down
in stop-and-go traffic, said
California Highway Patrol Officer
Richard Perez. No one was
seriously injured and there was no
visible damage to either vehicle,
he said.
Ms. Lewinsky’s stepmother,
Barbara Lewinsky, complained of
pain, but said she would seek her
own medical care, Perez said.
The three people in the APTV
car, driven by reporter Jeff
Schaeffer, were not injured.
No one has been cited pending
the police investigation.

ABC’S of Lewinsky investigation
WASHINGTON (AP) — It
was just three weeks ago that
President Clinton completed an
extraordinary six-hour deposition
in the Paula Jones sexual
harassm ent case. C linton was
asked then, in private, about
his relationship with M onica
Lewinsky, a form er W hite
House intern.
Now the relationship is the
subject
of
a
W hitew ater
prosecutor’s investigation. H ere’s
a prim er on a crisis that has
entangled the Clinton presidency.
Q: What is the core issue?
A: Did President C linton
have an affair with Ms.
Lewinsky, and did he urge her to
cover it up or ask his adviser
Vernon Jordan to do so?
Q: Legally, what difference
does it make?
A. If true, Clinton could be
open to charges o f perjury,
suborning
perjury,
witness
intimidation and obstruction of
justice. Perjury, because sources
say C linton denied having a
sexual relationship w ith Ms.
Lew insky in his Jan.
17
deposition. The other charges
could come into play if Clinton
tried to persuade Ms. Lewinsky
to lie about their relationship in
an affidavit in the Jones case.
Q: How is the Lewinsky
m atter
connected
to
the
Jones lawsuit?
A: Mrs. Jones filed a lawsuit
in 1994 accusing C linton of
sexual harassment when he was
Arkansas governor. Her lawyers
are
investigating
C linton’s
contacts with other women to try
to establish a pattern of improper
w orkplace
conduct.
They
identified Ms. Lew insky as a
potential witness.
Q: How did she come to
their attention?
A: The lawyers subpoenaed
Ms. Lew insky after receiving
anonym ous
telephone
calls
suggesting she was involved
with Clinton.
Q:
Just who is Ms.
Lewinsky?
A: M onica S. Lewinsky is a
Californian
who
cam e
to
W ashington as a 21-year-old
W hite House intern in June 1995.
That December, she got a paid
W hite House position. In April
1996, she moved to a job at the
Pentagon. She quit last December
to seek a job in New York.
Q: W hy are investigators
focusing on Ms. Lewinsky’s New
York job search?
A: They want to know if
Vernon Jordan helped Ms.

Lewinsky find work in order to
influence her testimony to keep
her quiet about an im proper
relationship with Clinton. Jordan,
a high-pow ered W ashington
lawyer,
has
acknow ledged
recom m ending her to three
companies. White House deputy
chief of staff John Podesta helped
her get a job offer from U.N.
A m bassador Bill Richardson.
Both say they did so at the
request o f Betty Currie, the
president’s secretary.
Q: Why is Kenneth Starr,
the W hitew ater independent
counsel,
investigating
the
Lewinsky matter?
A: Ms. Lew insky’s friend
and Pentagon co-worker, Linda
Tripp, went to Starr and turned
over
tape-recorded
private
conversations in w hich Ms.
Lewinsky said she had a
relationship with Clinton. Starr
asked Attorney G eneral Janet
Reno for jurisdiction over any
possible criminal violations in the
matter, and she agreed.
Q: Why would Tripp tape her
private conversations with a
friend and take them to a
prosecutor?
A: Tripp says she made the
tapes to protect herself against
potential accusations o f perjury
when she testified before Jones’
lawyers under subpoena. Her
friend, conservative activist and
literary
agent
Lucianne
Goldberg, encouraged Tripp to
record the conversations. Tripp
says she gave the tapes to Starr
“to report potential crim es.”
Q: What is the significance
of three pages of “talking points”
that Ms. Lewinsky allegedly gave
to Tripp?
A: This is a typed document
that Tripp says she was given by
Ms. Lewinsky. The docum ent
urges Tripp to file an affidavit in
the Jones case that backs away
from her account about another
woman confiding she’d been
fondled
by
Clinton.
The
document also urges Tripp to say
that Ms. Lewinsky is a liar whose
information regarding an affair
with
Clinton
is
untrue.
Prosecutors
are
trying
to
determine who wrote the “talking
points.”
Q: What about reports that
C linton gave Ms. Lew insky
gifts?
A: Ms. Lewinsky’s lawyer,
William Ginsburg, has said he
only knows of insignificant gifts
from the president such as a long
T-shirt, a hat pin, ashtrays, golf
balls and a souvenir hat from

M artha’s Vineyard. Prosecutors
are trying to determine whether
other items have been removed
from Ms. Lewinsky’s apartment.
Q: What about reports that
Ms. Lewinsky visited the White
House frequently after moving to
a job at the Pentagon.
A: Ginsburg has not disputed
reports that governm ent logs
show Ms. Lewinsky was cleared
to visit the White House 37 times
after leaving her job there. But it
is not known whom she saw there
or how often she actually visited.
Q: How does Clinton explain
all o f this?
A: Clinton has forcefully
denied that he had sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky or
that he asked anyone to lie about
it. But he has refused to address
more specific questions, such as
how well he knew Ms. Lewinsky
or why she visited the White
House so often. He says the
answers will come out in the
course of the investigation.
Q:
W hat
does
Ms.
Lewinsky say?
A: Ms. Lewinsky has not
commented publicly, but she has
given conflicting accounts in
private settings. She has been
taped telling Tripp in detail of a
sexual relationship with Clinton.
She submitted an affidavit in the
Jones lawsuit denying that she
had a sexual relationship with
Clinton. Sources say she has
offered to recant that claim if
given
im m unity
from
prosecution.
H er
law yer
describes her relationship with
Clinton as that of “colleagues.”
Q: W hat’s next?
A: Starr’s investigators are
trying to broker a deal under
which Ms. Lewinsky would tell
all that she knows in exchange
for immunity from prosecution.
In addition, a grand ju ry is
hearing testimony from White
House officials and others who
m ight know about C linton’s
contacts with M s. Lewinsky.
Investigators
also
have
subpoenaed various W hite House
documents and other items that
might shed light on the matter.
Q: Would prosecutors try to
indict Clinton if they found
evidence of criminal activity?
A: It seems unlikely. Under
the independent counsel law,
evidence of a crime involving the
president would be turned over to
the House Judiciary Committee,
which would decide whether an
im peachm ent
inquiry
is
warranted.

Black students at University
of Maine battle culture shock
ORONO, Maine (AP) —
When black students arrive
at the University of Maine, the
first question they are asked is
often “W hat sport do you play?”
rather than “W hat will you
study?”
Of the 9,213 students
enrolled at the university, only 66
- far less than 1 percent - identify
themselves as black. O f those 66,
43 are athletes.
Arriving at a virtually allwhite campus can trigger culture
shock and feelings of isolation.
At worst, there can be outright
racial hostility - the kind that
occurred in December when three
white hockey players left a slurfilled death threat on the voice
mail of a black football player.
Most African-Americans on
campus are satisfied that outright
racism like that in the call to
Dwayne Wilmot is rare. But other
issues surface on a day-to-day
basis: white students who don’t
make eye contact, slurs written
on dormitory or bathroom walls,
professors who refer to a group of
black students sitting together in
a classroom as “the scholarship
section.”
“The tension is there,” says
Bryan Michael Long, a fifth-year
senior who completed an injuryplagued football career last fall.
“I think you can feel the tension
more than you can see the actual
racism . I think it’s because
there’s a lack of understanding
and a big level of ignorance.”
Todd Williamson, fresh from
H ackensack High School in
northern New Jersey, knew he
was in an alien culture when he
attended a psychology lecture his
first day at the university.
Scanning the room, he saw all
white faces.
“It was like 249 people and
myself,” he says. “That’s when it

kind of hit me. That’s when the
culture shock came - the first day
of class.”
Williamson stuck it out and
graduated last May with a degree
in education. He now works at
the university, helping to provide
academic support to athletes.
W hen asked why they came
to Maine, many black athletes tell
the same story: they were lured
by full scholarships and the
opportunity to compete at the
Division I level.
But many leave without a
degree. Williamson remembers
how his freshman room m ate
transferred after 2 1/2 years at
Maine because the culture wore
him down.
“I’ve talked to a lot of people
that ju st can’t take
it,”
Williamson says. “They’re like,
‘This is crazy.’ There’s not a lot to
do. There’s no black women up
here.
T here’s
no
black
fraternities. T here’s a lot of
different things that would make
you not come to M aine,
especially if you’re not an
athlete. If y o u ’re just a regular
student, w hat’s out there for
you?”
Most minorities on campus
agree that improving campus
climate goes well beyond merely
eliminating incidents like the one
betw een the hockey players
and Wilmot.
It
even
goes
beyond
reaching, as university president
Dr. Peter Hoff says, “a critical
mass” of minority students and
faculty. And it goes beyond the
“zero tolerance” stance the
university adm inistration has
taken against racism.
“We need to have a balance,
and there is no balance,” says
Adonis Ferreira, the assistant
dean for multicultural programs
at the university. “But numbers

itself isn’t going to do it. W e’re
talking about campus climate.
That’s major.”
Sean Frazier, an A fricanAmerican who came to Maine in
1995 as an assistant football
coach and serves as assistant to
the athletic director for equal
opportunity, has been credited
with helping to create a
better
environm ent
for
minority athletes.
Part academic adviser, part
sounding board, he organizes
conferences, teaches a class,
facilitates discussions and, as one
student says, “gets things done.”
“The biggest thing is having
someone who they can confide
in, who they can talk to about
issues,” Frazier says. “You can’t
be bringing ethnic minorities up
to campus without the proper
support. If you do that, we run the
risk of potential liability. And that
means, basically, we run the risk
of ruining a young person’s life.”
Two years ago, Frazier
helped form the Student Heritage
Alliance Center. A dressed-up
commons room in the basement
of a dormitory, it serves as a place
for all races to come together, as
a place for minority students
to congregate.
The challenge facing the
university is to find athletes and
students who can work toward
achieving diversity in a place that
is geographically and culturally
unaccustomed to it.
“The one thing we say about
this place - it helps to build
character,” says Ben Sirmans, an
A frican-A m erican
w ho’s
a
former football player and now
serves as an assistant coach and
recruiting coordinator. “It’s an
adjustment. But if you can make
it up here, you can m ake it
anywhere.”

More than half o f those
asked, or 57 percent, said it was
possible for the president to
behave
unethically
in his
personal life and maintain
integrity in his job as president,
while 34 percent said that was not
possible.
When asked if they thought
reports that Clinton had “sexual
relations of any kind” with
Lewinsky were true, 11 percent
said
the
allegations
were
definitely true, 35 percent said
they were probably true, 23
percent said they were probably
false, 8 percent said they were
definitely false, and 24 percent
said they didn’t know or declined
to answer.
Respondents were alm ost
evenly split on the question of
impeachment.
Forty-three percent of those
asked said Clinton should be
impeached if it is found he had an
affair with an intern and lied

about it, while 45 percent said he
should not be impeached.
First lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton also did well in the poll,
with 74 percent of respondents
saying they approved o f the way
she had handled the crisis. Only
14 percent said they disapproved.
W hitew ater
prosecutor
Kenneth Starr did not fare as
well, with 44 percent saying they
disapproved of the way Starr is
doing his job. Thirty-two percent
said they approved.
In further results reported in
Monday’s edition, the newspaper
said 60 percent of respondents
said they knew of someone who
had had an affair, m eaning a
sexual relationship between two
people where one or both party is
married to someone else.
Tw enty-nine percent said
they
have had
a
sexual
relationship involving someone
else at work.

I hate to complain, but I miss
the wacky teen sex comedies of
the 80s. There has not been a
good, pointless wacky one
in years.
Sure, Adam Sandler comes
the closest with his attempts, but
he is cursed by the studiofriendly PG-13. Now, the sex
comedies o f the 80s I remember
were all rated R. T hat’s R for
nudity and vile language your
mother would cringe at hearing.
I miss the “Anim al Houses,”
“Revenge o f the N erds” and
“Bachelor Parties” that I stayed
up late to watch on HBO. I
accuse John Hughes o f killing
the genre. He slowly weaned the
youth of America off the great
teen sex comedy.
Sure, he teased us with the
nutty “Sixteen Candles.” He was
even able to convince the
Motion Picture A ssociation of
America to give it a PG rating!
It had bare breasts and Molly
Ringwald said f*ck! He was in
cahoots with som eone to rid the
world of good teen sex
comedies.
Next, he gave us “The
Breakfast Club.” It was rated R,
had filthy language and drugs.
John Hughes is our buddy!
Then, he turned on us.
Eventually we got “Home

No dirty language, no nudity and
no sex! W here’s the fun in that?
And, it hasn’t changed since.
Today’s wacky teen comedies
feature some PG-13 dufus in
pointless situations.
I propose people send me

Women’s hoops out shoot Kentucky and Bellarmine
■ BY JASON
TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
The
C ougar
w om en’s
basketball team shot a combined
54 percent from the three
point line in last w eek’s
conference
victories
over
K entucky
W esleyan
and
Bellarmine College.
Thursday the C ougar’s Misi
Clark and Erica Cory exploded in
the first half against Kentucky
Wesleyan. The guard tandem hit
seven three point shots in the first
15 minutes of the 85-70 victory.
The chances for the Wesleyan
squad were limited as they didn’t
get close to taking the lead
throughout the contest. The 11-3
run by the Cougars in the first

three minutes of the game
was all SIUE needed to
stay ahead and take the
win.
W esleyan
seemed
overmatched on defense.
The Cougars shattered the
Panthers 3-2 zone with
m id-range
and
long
jumpers all-around. SIUE
was sharp on the scoring
end of the floor as they hit
28-52 shots and had four
players in double figures.
Clark led all scorers
with 26 points and hustled
for eight rebounds as Kim

and put in a supportive 22

players
scored in their 80-65 loss
Saturday at the Vadalabene
Center. The Lady Knights
tried to keep up with
SIU E’s
offense
by
launching 22 threes but
only hitting six.
On the other hand, the
Cougars tagged 10 of their
18 three point shots and
their shooting percentage
from the floor (47.9) was
less than their three point
percentage (55.6).
Short scoring spurts
kept the Cougars in the
game with four and five
point runs in the first half.
Along with C ory’s four
threes, and Kim Lowe’s 20

points and eight rebounds, Clark
followed suit with 16 points and
two steals.
The second half started with
SIUE leading 39-37. Then Cory
hit two threes back-to-back and
started a 13-0 Cougar scoring run
with which the Lady Knights
couldn’t battle back. Bellarmine
never came within 10 points of
the lead the rest of the game.
This week the Cougars are
back on the road after the short
two-game home schedule. The
women are down to four games
until the GLVC championship
and March Madness starts. SIUE
will head to Indiana to face 5-17
IU/PU Fort Wayne and 10-12

After victories in their two
previous games, the SIUE Ice
Hockey team kept the momentum
going for a 5-1 win over
Wheaton.
The Cougars jum ped out to
an early 4-0 lead after the
first period.
Jeff Rasch put SIUE on the
board with Mike Gerling picking
up the assist. A D ave Miskelley
goal m ade it 2-0 with an assist
from Brad Brussatti and Rasch.
M ike Rudy widened the lead to
three when he found the back of
the net.
Brussatti notched his second
point o f the gam e when he
redirected a Rob M aher shot from
the blue line past the Wheaton
netminder.
W heaton broke up the shutout
early in the second, but the
Cougars got the goal back in the
third
period
w hen
Bob
Dellamano picked up a rebound
in front of the net and buried it.
“The way we utilized the

support system was textbook,”
head coach Bill Misiak said. “We
implemented what we practiced.
Everyone stayed focused and
worked the game plan.”
M ark Popelar and M aher
anchored
an
outstanding
defensive effort w hile Dan
Kennedy, Brussatti and Gerling
led the Cougars with aggressive
forechecking.
Misiak was happy to see his
third line score two of the
five SIUE goals. The “Lone
W ingers” line is made up of
ex-roller hockey turned ice
hockey players.
“They were playing so well
that I gave them the most ice time
of any line,” Misiak said about
his third line.
SIUE
goaltender
Greg
Franklin played an outstanding
game stopping 36 of the 37 shots
he faced.
“This was the best I’ve seen
Franklin play,” defenseman Matt
Foristal said. “He played nearly
perfect. He was definitely a key
factor in the win.”
The Cougars managed to put a

season-high 51 shots on the
Wheaton net.
“W ith our system , w e’re
taking three times the shots that
we did at the beginning of the
season,” M isiak said.
SIUE will try and made it four
in a row this Saturday at
10:15 a.m. when they host
W ashington U niversity at the
East Alton Ice Arena.
“They’re an aggressive team,”
M isiak said. “We have to play
good
defense
and
keep
forechecking well.”
The
three-gam e
winning
streak has changed the moral of
the SIUE players according
to Foristal.
“Every player on this team has
im proved,”
Foristal
said.
“There’s a team chemistry in the
locker room that w asn’t there
earlier in the season. Playing
together and getting a few wins
in a row has boosted our
excitement dramatically. We feel
like w e’re an actual team for
the
first
tim e
and
most
importantly, w e’re having fun.”

Cougar wrestling looking for win to help record
■ BY BRIAN

SPORTS REPORTER
The C ougar w restlers have
had little success against division
one schools this season.
Last
Thursday,
Indiana
dominated the Cougars as junior
Titus Taylor and Steve Brown
were the only winners. Taylor
im proved his record to 14-4
while Brown wrestled tough to
win in overtime.

Over the weekend, the
Cougars lost to both Eastern
Illinois, 32-10, and Northwestern
Wildcats, 27-7.
Junior
Titus
Taylor
is
emerging as the top wrestler for
this year’s squad as he was the
lone wrestler to win both of his
matches over the weekend. The
Centreville native is wrestling in
the 158 pound weight class and
posts a 16-4 record, pinning four
of his opponents.

Newly arrived Jessie Montez
picked up his first victory in a
Cougar uniform by defeating
Northwestern’s Micah Hey, 3*2.
Demos Glass earned a victory
over Rob Serio of Eastern, 5-3.
Senior Kris Davis won a close 54 match defeating Scott Brost of
Eastern. Steve Brown received a
forfeit against Northwestern.

Cougar track competed as a team; placed individually
■ BY FARRAH GRIMES
SPORTS STRINGER
This past weekend the m en’s and women’s track team
traveled to Rom eoville, 111. for the Lewis Indoor
Invitational.
This track meet, unlike many others, relied solely on
the individual’s performance.
One of the individuals, junior Bill Beckly, missed
breaking the school record by one second in the 600 meter
run. Beckly finished second in the 1000 meter run with a

time o f 2:36.40. He also ran the 800 and 400 meter run.
Head coach Darryl Frerker said that he anticipates that
Beckly would qualify for the 800 meter run in the NCAA
II Indoor Championships in Indianapolis, coming up
march.
Another strong individual runner was sophomore,
Radiance Pitts. At the Lewis invite, she finished sixth in
the 55 meter dash with a time of 7.60. Pitts’ other events
included 200 meter run and 100 meter run (outdoor).
“She’s doing great for her first season,” Frerker said.
He also thinks that Pitts is an asset to the women’s
track team

Special mentions: The assistant coach, Kevin Warner
broke a personal record in the indoor 55 hurdles. In the
men’s long jum p and high jump, Travis Gude placed fifth.
Kelly Huckleberry finished third in the men’s 200 meter
hurdles. In the women’s 3000 meter run, Nicole Done
placed third with a time of 11:01.60. Becky Hagenbruch
finished sixth in the 200 meter dash and fifth in the 400
meter dash.
The teams next designation will be to Carbondale, 111.
for the Saluki Indoor Open. Frerker is looking forward to
another successful track meet.
