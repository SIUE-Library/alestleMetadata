MCT, dance policy takes center stage
Students angered by proposed policies
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
F or a second consecutive student governm ent
m eeting, the Telecom munications Task Force and
M CT (M adison C ounty Transit) buses dom inated
discussions.
Kim Black, head of the Telecom m unication Task
Force, m ade available a w ritten report but was
unable to attend the student senate meeting. Some
senators questioned Black’s absence for a second
straight meeting.
“I ’m concerned that the longer we wait, the
longer it will take for things to get done,” Senator
A ntonio Stephens said.
Senator R obert M um phard offered the idea of
having an alternate representative of the task force
to address student governm ent.
Student Body President C hristopher Nance said
Black had a scheduling conflict but should be able
to attend the next m eeting in two weeks. Nance also
said that any student who wants a copy of the

report could get one from student governm ent.
T h e task force addressed several concerns
students had:
• T elephone services on cam pus will be
dramatically im proved as a result of a contract with
GTE. The contract includes the recabling of the
Tower Lake and Residence Hall telephone cables.
• O IT is currently exploring the possibility of
providing resale of the telep h o n e service to
H ousing students by acting as the central office
instead of going through another company. This
would allow students the benefit of reduced costs
for local and long distance calls.
• T here is $65,000 of uncollected debt incurred
by students in telephone calls. This, along with the
$1.1 million lost in telephone fraud, is why O IT is in
debt.
A nother m uch-debated issue was services being
provided by M CT buses. Senators voiced their
continuing dismay with unresolved issues.
“M CT told us that one of the reasons why buses
could not go on the upper 500 side (at Tower Lake)

Music men !

was because of bus size. H ow ever I have seen
bigger buses come down there during the evening
hours,” Senator Stephens said.
Senator C harm ayne W hite said she is continuing
her meetings as part of the M CT advisory board
and receiving vital input from students.
Nance also w anted to em phasis the issue of the
upper 500 side.
“T he buses going up there on the upper 500 side
was the (deciding factor) betw een the university
receiving an im proved service with handicappedaccessible buses and o th er im provem ents or M CT
packing up their bags and going back hom e,”
Nance said. “M CT also said the m ajor reason (for
not going to the upper 500 buildings) was because
of scheduling during the m orning hours.”
M any senators are still working on improving
the services that are being provided by MCT.
T he final issue discussed F rid ay was the

Blaze scorches national forests
M O N TA N A — A fire that was
sparked by lightning last week has
destroyed 34 hom es and threatened a dozen more, burning almost
13,000 acres in C uster N ational Forest. M ore than 800 firefighters have
struggled to contain the blaze, digging fire lines and using airplanes and
helicopters to drop retardant and w ater on the fire’s hot spots.

Russian soldiers leave Chechnya
C H E C H N Y A :— The first wave of Russian troops began pulling out of
Chechnya Sunday. M em bers of the 133rd Tank Battalion, which had
seen m ost of the m ajor fighting since war broke out in D ecem ber 1994,
left for their hom e base outside of St. Petersburg. A peace accord,
reached by Russian security chief A lexander Lebed and top rebel
leaders, contains the key provision of deferring for five years the
question of Chechnya’s ultim ate political status. Interior M inster
A natoly Kulikov insisted Sunday that Chechnya should not be allowed
to secede.

State’s Attorney gets tough on Freeman-style groups
M A D ISO N C O U N TY — S tate’s A ttorney William R.
H aine said M adison County has been successful taking a
hard line against Freem en-style groups who claim their
own court system and reject state laws.
H aine has tagged m ore than 50 people with criminal
charges and ordered “bogus” docum ents they’ve filed
purged from county files. H e said many in the groups
have a grievance with court decisions and have turned to
“common-law courts” for relief. B ut some people did not
realize that the docum ents they had been taught to file
were illegal.
Assistant S tate’s A ttorney M ichele Berkel said she had
found a connection betw een some of those working in
M adison County and the group of Freem en that held off
FBI agents for 81 days in M ontana. She said there was
evidence that some of the groups were connected to
white-suprem acist organizations and some param ilitary
militia groups.
“It’s incredibly im portant for the public to understand
what they’re getting involved in,” when they associate
with some of these groups, she said.

One incident can change
your whole outlook on life
By Melanie Adams
Editor In Chief
It is strange how in a brief m om ent an
incident can change your whole outlook on
life and m ake you realize how grateful we
should be to be alive.
For example, there have been two m ajor
occurrences in my life over the past few weeks
that have m ade me feel grateful for what I
have.
The first occurrence is w hat my loving
fiance’ and I call the “rollerblading incident.”
A couple of weeks ago, my significant other
and my ro o m m ate decided to take me
rollerblading around campus.
I had been rollerblading twice before this
and b oth tim es I was on a flat, straight
blacktop—nothing too daring.
Anyway, they took me around campus,
through L ot 5 (which I hated), down hills
( where I closed my eyes), and finally onto a
slope in Lot A.
I was terrified. I am not exactly the epitom e
of grace so when I started to pick up speed on
the slope, I freaked and tried frantically to stop
myself, one problem though; I couldn’t.
Not being able to stop probably w ouldn’t
have been such a problem if I h ad n ’t been
headed straight for a line of cars which were
pulling out of the lot. However, I am about as
lucky as I am graceful and was approaching the
cars at a high speed.
Just as I thought I was going to becom e road
kill, my fiance’, who was blazing behind me,
grabbed me by the arm and flung me around
the corner.
We fell, he landing on top of me and I,
receiving an ugly bruise that looks worse than
it feels, but at least I didn’t get run over.
(I knew I loved that m an for a reason!)

It m ade me realize that we go through life
with a lot of near misses and we need to know
our limits. ( I should have taken the less bumpy
road!)
A nother incident truly m ade me realize how
precious family really is.
It was Labor Day w eekend and I was in a
bad mood. I was tired of school, I was tired of
planning a wedding; I was tired of my family.
Just as I was about to start in griping about
“the fam,” I received a phone call from my
fiance’.
With a weird tone in his voice he told me
that some friends of the family had been in an
accident. The father had been driving and was
dead. His two sons, one my age, were in critical
condition in a hospital in St. Louis.
W hat a wake-up call. Not thirty seconds
before, I had been complaining about how
awful my life and my family are, while a m other
was across the river trying to hold on to the
surviving m em bers of her family.
W hat a truly hum bling experience. It really
opened my eyes.
O ver the next few days we went over to the
hospital and visited the boys and their family.
We realized that they were extrem ely lucky to
have survived the accident after we were told
that the car was hit head on and then flipped
over, end-over-end.
As I looked at the boys in their hospital
beds grieving over their father and their own
misfortune, I realized just how much we take
life for granted.
In a flash, your whole life can change, either
for the better o r for the worse.
The most im portant thing I realized was not
to waste any m inute of my life, because you
never know when it can be taken from you.

Letter to the editor

Tired of the Bible thumping
This is in response to B rian A. Scheutz’s response to my
letter to the Bible thum pers on campus, that is, people who
use the Bible to thum p groups of people, in this case, most
notably all the “sinners,” including the homosexuals.
Thank G od that B rian has spared us the full enum eration
of his list, no doubt too long to be contained in a short
editorial letter.
I guess you missed my point, Thum per, or thought that it
was unim portant, that in this dem ocracy it is merely your
opinion that hom osexuality is a sin. T here is no scientific
basis for your belief. A nd the governm ent shouldn’t be
looking into my bedroom or anyone’s with Bible in hand.
Democracy, not theocracy.
B ut som eone really ought to explain to you the bad
m anners and insensitivity involved in classifying a group of
people as sinners and then publicly announcing it. I can tell
you it is not conducive to inculcating feelings of love. To
quote your letter, “It’s difficult for me to express ... (my
concept of) love in a way that you’d truly understand, so you
would seek it.”
Frankly, I think you owe me, and all hom osexuals on
campus, an apology.
You ask why I am upset. I am upset because I’m tired of
the Bible thum pers quoting scripture to me in order to
classify me as a sinner. Back off. L earn to em brace diversity.
L earn a little humility about the im portance of your own
belief system com pared to others who differ from you. G et
educated.
A nd above all, d o n ’t tell me that G od doesn’t accept me
(being the unapologetic, even grateful, hom osexual that I
am). W hat a preposterously grandiose and condescending
thing to do! N ot to m ention immoral.
Caustically yours,
James F. Andris
Associate Professor

Letter to the editor _________________

Mr. Schuetz, it is time to re-read your Bible
This letter is a response in regard to Brian A.
Schuetz’s views regarding the D efense of M arriage
Act. This proposed law has no place in the U nited
States o r anyw here for that m atter. As a Southern
Baptist, I am am azed at Schuetz’s bigoted and
narrow-m inded interpretation of the Bible, as well as
the C onstitution. A dolf H itler used the Bible as a
crutch for his Nazi H olocaust of Jews, Gypsies,
homosexuals and num erous other groups of people.
Perhaps, Brian, you ought to re-read the Bible
and you’ll find that the Bible teaches that you are to
love all people. While you’re at it, why don’t you read
one of o u r F ounding F a th e r’s views regarding
church/state relations, Thom as Jefferson.
F u rth erm o re you ought to read the 9th
L e tte rs to th e e d ito r policy:

or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges
or im munities of citizens of the U nited States; nor
shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or
property, w ithout due process of law; nor deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of
the laws.”
The 9th A m endm ent states, “The enum eration in
the C onstitution, of certain rights, shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by
the people”. In a recent U.S. Suprem e C ourt ruling
earlier this year, R om er v. Evans, the High C ourt
declared that in fact homosexuals were protected
from discrim ination under the 14th Am endm ent.

O n a final note, Mr. Schuetz, perhaps you ought to
ask your beloved right-wing Republican Congress,
led by U.S. H ouse Speaker Newt Gingrich, why, if
they claim to be so moral, have they and their ultra­
conservative allies been involved in every kind of
corruption imaginable! You also should ask Gingrich
why h e’s led the C ontract Against A m erica’s War on
the poor, elderly, and hard-w orking middle-class
Americans. A fter all, Mr. Schuetz, isn’t it the Biblical
thing to do to care of those who are in need of
assistance?!

Meeting
from front page
T he p ro p o sed policy, which has no t been
approved, caused some friction betw een senators
and students who attended the m eeting.
“I can’t understand how this policy was drafted
w ithout stu d en ts being in the policy-m aking
m eetings,” R am on Blakely, form er student body
president, said.
A dance policy com m ittee was m ade up of
Cheryl H eard and Steve Sperotto, assistant director
and director of Kim m el Leadership D evelopm ent
C e n te r respectively, C hief M cD onald of the
U niversity Police an d Lyle W ard and M ary
R o b in so n , assistant d irec to r and d irecto r
respectively of the UC.
H eard said the com m ittee w anted to im plem ent
using ID scanners and registering visitors until an
ap p ro v ed d ance policy was finalized by the
university. H eard also said the ID scanner is a
necessary tool to provide security for S IU E
students from people outside the cam pus.But some

Fairview Heights
398-2290

saw it as just another exam ple of disregarding
student^.
With the ID scanner system, the university will
be able to check the num ber of students who are
not financially clear or who are not enrolled from
entering the dance w ithout registering. T he scanner
would also limit outside students.Those students
from o th er universities or non-college students
would have to have a student from SIU E sign them
in.
“First it was MCT, then the telephones and now
this dance policy. T he university has a to tal
disregard for student opinions,” Blakely said.
“O ver thfc last two years, the university has held
im p o rtan t m eetings w ithout students — the
retention com m ittee and orientation com m ittee
m eetings were held w ithout students attending.
A nd the university has provided lip service to
student representation at meetings. They have no
consideration for stu d en ts,” R andy H obson,

form er student senator, said.
Nance pointed out that some o f the policies
th at have been im plem ented on campus without
students’ knowledge stem s from lack of student
involvement.
“ I t ’s lack of stu d en t involvem ent. W hen a
situation occurs, we attem pt to do dam age control.
Students need to get involved on these (student
governm ent) com m ittees,” he said.
V ice-C hancellor of S tudent A ffairs N arbeth
E m m anuel, who attended the meeting, suggested
that five students be nam ed and participate in the
dance policy com m ittee. No new dance policy was
im plem ented for a dance that was held on Friday
night.
Each organization who participates in dances
held on cam pus will have the opportunity to offer
feedback to the proposed policy in the following
weeks.

Bank Returned
Check Fee Increased
at
The Office Of The Bursar
Effective August 1, 1996, the Bank
Returned Check Fee (BRC) was
increased from $15 to $25 per BRC.
A BRC is defined as a check which has
been returned from a commercial lending
institution due to insufficient funds.
The revenue currently collected from the
BRC fee is not sufficient to cover all the
costs of collecting bad checks. This
increase will help shift the cost of BRCs
from all students back to those individu­
als who write bad checks.

Oakland beats Cougars in O.T.
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor

File Photo/A/esrfe
The men's soccer team falls to 2-1 on the year.

The SIU E M en’s Soccer team
was fresh off their upset of third
ran k ed M ercyhurst w hen they
found them selves facing yet
another highly ranked regional
team , Oakland.
The Cougars expected a chal­
lenge in their first two weekends
of the season as they would play
two of the top ten team s in the
region.
Step one was com pleted last
w eekend
by
defeating
M ercyhurst, but they had another

hurdle on Sunday afternoon in
R ochester, Michigan.
It was a defensive affair as both
team s played scoreless soccer
throughout the whole 90 m inutes
of regulation.
“We had a battle royal on our
hands,” said head coach E d
Huneke. “B oth team s had played
very well defensively.”
The Cougars had their un d e­
feated string snapped in overtim e
as O akland scored 2 to give them
the 2-0 shutout. They fell to 2-1.
“This gam e was filled with
everything,” said Huneke. “G ood
offense, good goalkeeping, and
solid defense.”

Tim N ovak led th e stifling
C o u g ar defense and A ndy
K orbesm eyer played strong in the
net for SIU E, keeping O akland
off the board in regulation time.
“B oth team s played hard and
aggressive,” said H uneke. “W e’re
disappointed in the outcom e, but
this showed us th at w e’re as good
as any team in our region.”
The Cougars next contest will
be against M cK endree at hom e
on Wednesday.
“We have to watch out for this
team ,” said H uneke. “We have to
anticipate an aggressive effort on
their part.”

Volleyball continues to show promise
Beats ranked Missouri Southern
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
The SIU E volleyball team is now
6-4 after their second w eekend of
the season.
Last w eekend the Cougars took
fourth in the IU P U -Indianapolis
Tournam ent and this past w eekend
they finished 2-2 in the Missouri
Southern State Tournam ent.
O ut of these two tournam ents
the Cougars beat a top ranked team
and learned a few things along the
way.
“W e’ve m atured in the past two
weekends. A nd we are playing good
as a team and to only have 10
m atches under our belts, it is a good
sign,”

Sophom ore M ichele G ilm an is con­
tinuing her excellent play .
She has recorded 20 plus kills in
most of her games.
“M ichele is just playing aw e­
some,” M ontgom ery said.
The Cougars started the to u rn a­
m ent with a victory over nationally
ranked Missouri Southern State and
followed it up with a victory over
Drury.

A fter those two wins the Cougars
ran into a wall with Trum an State
and H enderson State.
“We shouldn’t of lost to Truman
but H enderson State is an excellent
team. They have girls who could
jum p right out o f the roof,”
M ontgom ery said.
G oing
into
this
w eekend,
M ontgom ery said this will be a real
test for the team.
“They are proving to themselves
they can play with any team out
there. Missouri Southern was a big
confidence booster and to be able to
stick around with H enderson, who
has some strong girls, also is a
boost,” M ontgom ery said.
The Cougars finally come hom e
W ednesday for the first time this
year. O akland City will be the oppo­
