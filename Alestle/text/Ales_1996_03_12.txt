SIUE hosts debates for Congressional seats
By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
Students, faculty and m em bers of the community
looked on as D em ocrats Sam Cahnm an and Jay
Hoffm an, candidates running for the 20th District
congressional seat, answered questions and debated
on their political views on March 1.
T he debate was p art of a series of debates
sponsored by the University C enter Board (UCB)
which gives the individuals running for either the
Republican or Dem ocratic Primary Election in the
20th District the chance to explain their platform s and
how they differ on issues.
The debate was m oderated by Pat G auen of the
Illinois Post Bureau. Questions were taken from the
audience before the debate to save time during the
debate itself.
D uring the opening statem ents, Hoffm an thanked
m em bers of the UCB for hosting the debate and went
on to tell the audience about his own experiences in

SIU E students interested in television broadcasting now
have a new way to get involved. Square TV, a new studentproduced variety show, prem iered on the cam pus’ closed circuit
cable system on Feb. 28.
The show is the brainchild of SIU E senior Jeff Boulicault.
Boulicault first conceived the idea over a year ago. H e began
by contacting departm ent heads in a search for interested
students to participate. The show is serving as his senior
project.
While all students are working as volunteers, the program
provides valuable work experience.
“I liked it,” said Senior Sheri McCord. “It’s hands on and
you’ve got to do everything.”

Bayer and Keith Neausbaum . The segm ent, a spoof of the
movie H oop Dreams, was titled “Basketball D ream er.” The
story followed the progress of Randall Freeburg, a wanna-be
basketball star long on talk but short on talent.
C urrent program s last about 20 m inutes, but Boulicault
hopes to expand in the future.
“We’re starting out with 20 m inutes, but w e’re trying to
develop a 30-minute show,” Boulicault said.
Plans for an interview with the nationally known rock band
Del Amitri and segm ents about the St. Louis St. Patrick’s Day
Parade are currently under developm ent for future programs.
Boulicault is also working to get movie passes and free C D ’s
to help stu dents with reviews. He is also looking for
underw riters to help with the purchase and upk eep of
equipm ent.
Boulicault hopes to further develop the show by expanding
into the Edwardsville and Maryville cable systems.
“We’re laying the groundwork. We hope to expand it to the
Edwardsville and Maryville cable system on public access.”
Students interested in helping on future shows are welcome.

letter to the editor________ _______________________________________________________________________________________

University should look for parking increase alternatives
As always, I write this on
my own and not on behalf
of anyone else.
I feel that the Parking
and Traffic C om m ittee
should look at alternatives
to the proposed $35
increase in parking sticker
fees. The reason is that
many students and faculty
and staff m embers feel that
it is too high a price to pay
for parking. H ere are
thoughts:
1. Finance the repairs to
the
parking
lots
by
installing gates at the roads
to the parking lots and
charge $0.25 when people
LEAVE the University.
This per-use fee is much
fairer
and
gives
the
advantage of being able to
charge higher in the future
as needs arise.
2. Use the money from
the increase to build
parking garages—one on
the south side of the
R endlem an Building and
one on the north side of the
Lovejoy Library. D rivers
can use their ID cards to
enter and exit the garages.
In addition, build enclosed
walkways to the building so
we can go to school and
work out of inclement weather. The construction of parking lots will make
space available for future building construction (new residence halls?).
3. A t the very least, any increase in sticker fees should be paid with the
following options for the campus community: a) payable all at once, or b)
payable over 3-6 months. This would be less of a financial strain on all
concerned.
The Alestle reported that the Staff Senate supported the increase. Well, the
Staff Senate doesn’t represent me in this case. Until I started work here at
SIUE, I never had to pay to park on em ployer’s parking lot. The parking lot
repairs w ere paid from monies collected from customers (known as gross
profits).

Also, when we (the customers of the parking lots) are dissatisfied with prices
and service, we do not have the choice of going to a com petitor’s lot. We are
stuck with what we got!
So, how about the University taking some time now to find out what we the
consumers want and then the price increases will be more palatable. Next
meeting of the Parking and Traffic Com m ittee is M arch 15 at 10 a.m. All of the
campus community should try and attend.

has taken a tax pledge to not raise taxes.
“I ’m glad that Sam has kept up with the
agreem ent to run a clean cam paign,” Hoffm an
joked.
Hoffman then gave his opinion on term
limitations in congress.
He said that although the Republican Party
may still hold power in Congress, there are
issues that both the leading political parties
agree on.
“Term limits, for example. The Republican
and D em ocrats do agree that term limits
should be created to limit the num ber of years
a person can serve in Congress,” Hoffm an
said.
Both candidates also discussed tax issues
and com m ented on G O P candidate Forbes’
flat tax proposal.
“A flat tax sounds good; however, most of
us would result in an increase and it would
bring in so much less that it will increase the
deficit. We must cut out corporate w elfare,”
Cahnm an said.
“The tax code has to be simplified. A flat
tax is not going to benefit anyone but the
upper class. It takes away from healthcare,
deductions, and hom e ownership,” Hoffm an
said.
“W hat we need is a tax code that small
owned businesses could get a 100 percent
reduction,” Hoffm an also said.
C ahnm an and H offm an agreed th at
corporations should not have the right to fire
workers who go on strike.
“C orporations should negotiate with
workers instead of fire them if they go on
strike. I support unions, and have always

Tuesday, March 12, 1996
supported unions,” C ahnm an said.
A n o th er topic that C ahnm an and Hoffman
agreed upon was the misuse of PACs and
special interest group funds in campaigns.
“ I have found th at th ere is too much
influence from lobbyist and special interest
groups. If I am elected, I will push to pass a bill
the will elim inate PAC funds during elections
and prohibit the mailing privileges to be used
for cam paigning for m em bers seeking
reelection,” C ahnm an said.
H e also said that corporate workers are too
greedy and they are passing their greed off on
to m em bers of Congress through PACs and
said that his opponent generously took PAC
m oney for his campaign .
H offm an agreed th at too much of the
special interest monies w ere being used and
that he is a leading advocate on putting a cap
on election m oney a candidate can receive
from special interest groups.
The candidates also com m ented on ways to
im prove the economy and provide jobs within
the state.
To ensure jobs, Hoffm an said, we need to
ensure technology, and we do that through
investing in education.
Cahnm an replied that we need to balance
the budget and invest in job training.
Hoffm an ended the debate by saying that he
feels it is unfortunate that politicians resort to
nam e calling and that people are wise enough
to know who to vote for.

W om en applicants w o n 't have to be in terview ed b y C itadel graduates fo r adm ission
C H A R LE ST O N , S.C. (A P) Women who apply
to The C itadel’s all-male cadet corps will not need to
be interviewed by Citadel graduates as part of the
admissions process, a federal judge said Friday.
“The problem is, there are no female alum ni,”
U.S. District Judge C. Weiston Houck said during a
hearing on how the college is to handle w om en’s
applications.
“Many of the male alumni are very much opposed
to The Citadel becoming coeducational,” and it
would not be fair to require women to m eet with
those who oppose their attending, H ouck said.
Male applicants must be interviewed by an
alumnus to help them learn m ore about the corps.
Houck said he would not substitute another form
orientation for women until the U.S. Suprem e C ourt
rules on the co n stitutionality o f all-m ale state
military colleges.

The court is expected to rule this spring in a
challenge to the all-male policy at Virginia Military
Institute.
The Citadel is processing applications from three
women who have applied to enroll this fall. One is
from Nancy M ellette who took Shannon F aulkner’s
place in the legal challenge to The C itadel’s all-male
corps. Ms. M ellette, from Irmo, attends a N orth
Carolina military academy.
Houck also filed 21 pages of docum ents he said
were faxed to his office last sum m er from the state
Higher Education Commission.
T he m aterial included 18 pages of budget
inform ation and three pages about course offerings
at The Citadel.
Citadel attorneys want Houck to remove himself
from the case. They say he violated the appearance
of impartiality when he received the inform ation

and discussed the case privately with state Higher
Education Com m issioner Fred Sheheen, a strong
advocate of women in the corps.
“The only thing I recall I was seeking was budget
inform ation and the only thing 1 received was
budget inform ation,” the judge said Friday.
He said earlier he wanted the inform ation to
prepare for the trial on w hether a state w om en’s
leadership program at C onverse College was
com parable to The Citadel. The leadership institute
is designed as an alternative to keep women out of
The Citadel.
The trial has been delayed until after the Supreme
Court rules.
Houck didn't decide w hether he will remove
himself. A ttorneys have until March 25 to file papers
dealing with the school’s motion.

woman and seriously injuring
two others.
The student pronounced dead

GREELEY, Colo. (AP)—
The University of N orthern
Colorado has reached a
$715,000 agreem ent with 56
faculty members who sued over
the way their pay was
calculated.
The agreem ent reached
Friday means a trial scheduled
April 1 in Weld County District
Court will be canceled.
The professors had claimed
in a June 1994 lawsuit that their
salaries were not properly
calculated
according
to
university policies. In part, they
argued that faculty salaries
w eren’t keeping pace with
those of administrators.
The agreement settling the
lawsuit calls for distributing
$715,000 to the tenured faculty
members using a formula to be
approved by the board of
trustees.
The 56 faculty members
represent roughly 10 percent of
UNC’s faculty.
The agreem ent stipulates
the lawsuit will not affect the
employees’ participation in any
early retirement programs. The
two sides also agreed there
would be no retaliation as a
result of the lawsuit.
Each side in the case will pay
its own attorneys’ fees and
costs.
“The board of trustees is
confident that this settlement is
in the best interests of the UNC
community,” said Kay Norton,
board vice chairwoman. “It will
avoid further disruption from
litigation and further the
boards agenda in moving the
institution forward.”
The attorneys for the faculty
members said the settlement
was in their clients’ best
interest.

Cougars end season with loss to IUPU-Ft. Wayne
By Eli Savoie

Ronnie Henderson was the star of the Cougars' final game, but his
27 points was not enough to prevent the Cougars from falling.

Four SIUE
wrestlers
headed to
nationals
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
A fter the slow start this
season due to injuries, the
S IU E w restling team is
finishing strong by sending
four w restlers to the N CAAII N ational T ournam ent at
N orth C olorado University.
B rian A n d erso n , Jason
Q uerciagrossa,
Jim
Czajkowski, and Jason C arter
all qualified after finishing
high in their respected weight
classes.
A nderson finished 3rd in
the 126 pound weight class
while Q uerciagrossa took
second in the 142 weight class
along with C arter doing the
same in the 190 pound class.
Czajkowski wrestled well
and found himself taking first
place at the tournam ent in
the Í67 pound weight class.

qualify for nationals out of
100 in the region. They take

The S IU E m en ’s basketball team
com pleted their first season as a m em ber of
the G re at Lakes Valley C onference by
splitting their final two games on Feb. 29, and
M arch 2.
O n leap day, the Cougars defeated St.
Joseph’s 75-60 behind the strong play of
C hris H arris and Jason H olm es. H arris
tallied 20 points for the victory while
H olm es pum ped in 19. Tim Holloway and
R onnie H enderson rounded out a quartet of
Cougars in double figures with 11 points
each.
The Cougars started their spring break off
on the wrong foot as they finished the season
with a 90-88 loss to IU PU -Ft. Wayne.
In the contest, the Cougars once again
received strong perform ances from Holm es
and H arris w ith 25 and 14 points
respectively.
The star of the show for SIU E however,
was H enderson who poured in 27 points
including 13-of-15 shooting from the freethrow line and two three pointers late in the
game to pull the Cougars close.
The C ougars effort w asn’t enough
though, as the M astadons were able to hold
on for the two-point victory.
The loss dropped the Cougars final record
for the season to 10-15 and 7-13 in the
GLVC.

Looking back on the season, assistant
coach Scott Eggleston said M onday that
although the team hoped to do better, for all
the players th at w ere lost to injury and
suspensions, the team ’s season wasn’t too
m uch of a disappointm ent.
O ne thing Eggleston did say the team
needed was to bulk up some on the inside.
“The league taught us we need big guys,”
Eggleston said. “T h at’s one area where we
were thin. We got beat up a lot in the low
post.”
H e added that weight training will be a
big part of the Cougars’ off season. The
coaches want everyone to come into practice
next year a little bigger.
Eggleston said that with all this year’s
players returning next season, and with the
right additions, the team will be ready to
m ake som e noise in the GLVC.
“If we get the right recruits in, we can
definitely be in the top half [of the
conference] and m aybe the top three or
four,” Eggleston said.
H e added that the team will have to learn
to be m ore consistent. H e hopes that they
can get to a point where they play with the
same em otion every night instead of the
roller coaster effect they had this season of
up one game and down the next.
O nly tim e will tell, but with the
experience of one conference season under
their belt and all their players returning, the
future seems to be bright for the Cougars.

Terri Evans of the Cougars was honored for her outstanding
play this season by being named first team all conference.
Teammate Alicia Harkins was named as an honorable mention.

Evans breaks record to
highlight final weekend
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter
Terri Evans highlighted the end of the SIU E w om en’s
basketball season by breaking the C ougars’ all-time career
scoring m ark on Feb. 29, at the V adalabene Center. The historic
feat happened at 14:44 of the first half in a 113-70 Cougar
victory over St. Joseph’s College. The new m ark stands at 1,649
points.
Evans also tied her own record when she went six of seven
from behind the three-point arch and finished the night with 19
points.
Sophom ore Alicia H arkins had a career high 32 points and
six rebounds and B eth Brown threw in 14 points. Cristina
Loom is and Am y M azner co n tributed 13 and 10 points
respectively to round out the five players in double figures
“We did a good job on the offensive boards,” said head coach
Wendy Hedberg. “Things were kind of falling in our hands
which helped us for a lot of put backs.”
The Cougars led by 28 points at halftime and never looked
back. They shot 64 percent from the field and 73 percent from
three point range in the final half.

Wrestling______________________
from page 14
finishers and seven wild cards. The coaches
vote on who they think are the seven best
wrestlers out of the third and fourth place
finishers to determ ine the wild cards,” H ead
Coach Larry Kristoff said M onday afternoon.
The Cougars finished the regional at second
place just behind the NO. 1 team in the nation,
which is C entral Oklahom a.
The No. 4 ranked team in the nation of
Wisconsin-Parkside came in and only finished
fourth in the ten team tournam ent.
“What I am saying is that they didn’t wrestle
very well in the regional,” Kristoff said.
Every year the regional tournam ent coaches
vote on a regional coach of the year. A fter the
votes were turned in, Kristoff and another
coach, R obin Ersland, tied for the honor.
It does not look like anything will stand in
the way of The four C ougar wrestlers who are

A l e s i l e

going to Colorado. K ristoff says they are
healthy and ready to go.
Two of the four wrestlers are going in with a
national ranking. A nderson and C arter are
both ranked eighth in the nation in their
respected weight class.
The Cougars as a team earned a ranking of
No. 20th in the NCAA Division 11 Wrestling
Coaches Association top twenty poll at the end
of the season.
A record of 3-7 looks deceiving but the
Cougars had injury problem s at the beginning
of the season and had to forfeit several weight
classes.
But with a healthy, full squad, the Cougars
defeated some of the lop wrestlers in the
country when they faced Central Oklahom a
and look to give a good perform ance at the
N C A A -II National Tournam ent March 15-16.
A sked if these rankings would give the
w restlers any added confidence, K ristoff

“O ur transition game worked well,” said Hedberg. “We came out early and played hard. We
were really sm art in the open floor.”
O n Saturday, M arch 2, the Cougars fell to lU P U -F t. Wayne 71 -65 in their last contest of the
season. Four S1UE players finished in double figures including Evans with 16 in her last game
at SIU E. H arkins had 15 points, junior Amy Tiietken concluded her year with an 11 point
perform ance and Pinckneyville’s Leslie Phillips scored 12.
The Lady Cougars ended their season with an overall record of 15-11 and a G reat Lakes
Valley C onference record of 10-10.
A pair o f Cougars were given postseason awards by the GLVC as Evans was nam ed firstteam all-conference and H arkins was nam ed to the team as an honorable mention.
Assistant coach Nancy Swain said M onday over the phone about the past year, “We had
hoped for a better record, but we played some tough com petition this season.”
“I'd like to see the team come into next season in better condition,” said Swain. “We will
need to play m ore consistent and cut down on our turnovers.”

Runners fail to qualify in
last attempt for nationals
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
SIU E track runners had one m ore shot at qualifying for
nationals over the break but could not do any b etter than
just having solid perform ances at the Indiana USA track
and field indoor championships.
“The runners that did go had solid perform ances like they
always do but did not achieve the national standard we were
looking for,” head coach D arryl F rerker said M onday
m orning in his office.
Travis R oundcount ran for 5th place in the one mile race
while team m ate Gus C oronado placed 4th in the 5,000m eter run.
“Gus d idn’t run quite as well as he wanted to. H e was off
his time a little bit,” Frerker said.
Placing fifth in the 3,000-meter was Jason Gass and in the
800-m eter Wayne B loem er ran for a 9th place finish.
Luke Lay ran in two races during the m eet with a 7th
place finish in the 200 and 14th place in the 400.
“O ut of some of these places we ran strong. A nd we
com peted largely against Division I schools and that can
m ake a bit o f a difference,” F rerk er said ab o u t the
com petition at Bloomington, Ind.
The Cougars only com peted in one event on the wom en’s
side of the field.
Vicki Johnson took first place in the 3,000-meter run.
“This was a good race on her part,” Frerker said.
Not having anybody qualify for nationals m eans the
indoor season is over for the Cougars and now they will
focus m ore on the outdoor season.
The first m eet will be at the end o f the m onth at the
W ashington Invitational in St. Louis, Mo.
