V o te r r e g is tr a tio n d r iv e a
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
T he com bined efforts o f A frican-A m erican
stu d en t organizations at S IU E to get students
registered to vote has proved to be successful.
O ver 400 students took the time out to register
Tuesday. R egistrars from M adison and St. Clair
Counties worked at tables in the University C enter
and Peck B uilding during the day. A t night,
registration tables were provided in the Commons
Building at Tower Lake A partm ents and in the
lobby of the Residence Hall.
O ne of the coordinators of the voting drive,
D errick Wright, was pleased with the outcom e of
the project.
“The registering of voters was the first phase.
Now the second phase is to get together and set a
voting forum for the upcom ing elections. The forum

is to m ake everyone aware how im portant their vote
is,” W right custom er service supervisor at the
University Book Store, said.
Som eone who knows about politics himself,
Student Body President C hristopher Nance said
students registering is a statem ent by “G eneration
X ’ers” on campus.
“ It (voting drive) was successful. You have the
‘Baby B oom ers’ generation out there talking about
‘G enerations X ’ers’ are apathetic to voting. T h at’s
quite the opposite,” Nance said. “We came out for
the registration drive. All that we (students) needed
was initiative to ensure responsible governm ents.”
Nance offered his services to the voting drive
Tuesday by registering voters himself. Nance has
been a M adison C ounty registrar for one year. He
also explains why he becam e a registrar.
“I felt an ethical responsibility to my community,
state and country,” Nance said.

su ccess

D espite the successful attem pt to get students to
vote, history has proven th at college stu dents
typically do not participate in elections.
John Farrell, associate professor at SIU E in the
departm ent of political science, gives reasons why
some students do not tend to Vote.
“G enerally, stu d en ts d o n ’t vote for one big
reason—that is a feeling of disengagem ent from the
community. For m ost college students, issues in the
cam paigns d o n ’t seem im m ediately im p o rtan t,”
Farrell said.
Farrell associates age with increased voting in
elections. O lder citizens worry about things such as
m ortgage, taxes, jobs—issues directly relating to
their welfare.
“The older the person is, the m ore likely the
person is to vote,” Farrell said.
Farrell said that this y ear’s percentage of students

Housing recycling efforts pay off for SIUE
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
University H ousing is saving the world — at
least part of it — with its recycling efforts.
In FY95, University H ousing recycled 65 tons
of m aterial. This fiscal year that num ber nearly
doubled, reaching 120 tons.
Scott Gluntz, housing coordinator, is convinced
that convenience is a key issue in the recycling
effort. Students in the Tower Lake A partm ent
complex and the Residence H all are now placing
recyclables in bins provided by Laidlaw Waste

M anagem ent Systems. The bins are located in
com m on areas. G luntz hopes that in the future
each room will have its own recycling container.
T he item s currently being collected are
cardboard, paper, newspaper, aluminum and tin.
Even though Laidlaw doesn’t collect plastics from
University Housing, Gluntz said students have
expressed an interest in recycling plastic items too.
H e encourages them to take that m aterial to the
recycling center in Edwardsville.
The prim ary objective of University H ousing’s
recycling efforts, according to G luntz, is to
increase environm ental awareness and to collect

recyclable m aterials. Last year a survey was
conducted on the recycling habits of the residents
of 255 apartm ents. Responses from 244 of those
residents indicated they w anted to see m ore
facilities. But only 117 said they used the current
facilities.
“We are w orking on a lot of different things (to
increase awareness) — direct education with
students, a Web site, U H TV 6 and training
bureaus. But we are in the early stages right now,”
G luntz said.
Some of these ideas will be im plem ented in the

slave-labor
Study states poor, elderly patients’ health suffers under
managed care plans

LA T IM E S— California Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill Monday
outlawing the purchase of goods produced in slave-labor camps in
China and other nations. The bill, actively supported by human rights
activist Harry Wu, is regarded as largely symbolic but with some
potential as an economic weapon. Wu spent 19 years as a political
prisoner in Chinese labor camps.
The bill applies solely to state government purchases but is
intended to build economic pressure against exploitative factories in
India, Pakistan and Brazil, as well as China.
In t e r n a t io n a l

AP — Twice as many poor and elderly patients suffering
from high blood pressure, heart problems and diabetes who
are in managed care are faring worse than similar patients
who have traditional fee-for-services medical insurance
plans, according to a study in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
The study involved 1,574 patients in Chicago, Los Angeles
and Boston who completed questionnaires.
Susan Pisano of the American Association of Health Plans,
which represents 1,000 managed care plans, criticized the
report. She said medical evaluations should have been used
instead.

U.N. votes to lift sanctions against Yugoslavia

Correction:
AP — The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to
lift sanctions imposed- against Yugoslavia in 1992, a sign of
international recognition of Serbia’s role in helping to bring peace to
the Balkans after three years of fighting.
The United States said it would continue to block Yugoslavia’s
participation in some international institutions like the U. N. General
Assembly until further steps were taken to reduce tensions in
the region.

Concerned husband outraged
at actions of MCT bus driver

Melanie Adams

On
Tuesday,
S ep tem b er
10,
at
approxim ately 8:40 p.m., A pril Smith left her
job at K-M art and started walking tow ard the
bus stop at the C ottonw ood Mall. Halfway to
the bus stop, Mrs. Smith noticed the bus
leaving the C ottonw ood Mall. In an effort to
catch the bus, Mrs. Smith began running and
waving down the bus driver as he turned on
R oute 159. As the bus driver rode past her, he
pointed rudely to the C ottonw ood Mall
saying, “T hat is the bus stop.” Mrs. Smith,
realizing nothing could be done, continued
walking to the C ottonw ood Mall w here she
waited another hour for the bus. W hen the
same bus driver who has been identified as
Jimmy, ID # 291, arrived, he stepped outside
th e bus to where Mrs. Smith was standing.
Mrs. Smith explained to Jim my that she
thought it was awful that he had seen her
running for the bus and he did not have the
courtesy to stop. Mrs. Smith went on to
explain that she was a college student and
that this was the only m eans of transportation
onto the campus. The bus driver yelled, “I
d on’t care ; you were not at the right stop.”
Mrs. Smith yelled back, “ I d o n ’t care; I just
wanted you to know how inconsiderate you
w ere.” The bus driver, in com plete shock that
a black wom an would have the nerve to
challenge his white authority by yelling back,
dem anded that she not get on the bus.
W hen the bus driver returned from his
break, he tried to jum p on the bus and
quickly shut the door. Mrs. Smith, who felt
she had every right to be on the bus, got on
before the door closed and deposited her
money. Once on the bus, the driver continued
talking about how he did not have to stop for
her, and if she did not get off he would call the
police. Mrs. Smith, who felt she was in the
right, agreed with him that calling the police
could clarify the matter. W hile waiting for the
police, the driver could not refrain from
carrying on with his com m otion. Mrs. Smith,
totally overw helm ed by this point, said,
“Why will you not just take me hom e and
stop acting like an asshole.” T he bus driver
was now happy he had finally pushed Mrs.
Smith to use profane language. Now he could
justify her not being on the bus, because up
until then he was just acting out of prejudice.
W hen the police arrived, he ran to m eet them
and quickly exaggerated about the way Mrs.
Smith had cussed him out. H e claim ed she
was causing a disturbance which is why he
w anted h er off. M rs. Sm ith had a
preconceived notion that the police would
uphold justice and allow the bus driver to
take her home. Given the perform ance of
police in the R odney King beating and the
beating of illegal Hispanic im migrants trying
to cross the border, she should have known
better.
W hen the police came on to the bus, they
told Mrs. Smith that she had to get off the bus
because the d riv er reserves the right to
rem ove passengers with whom he has a
conflict.
By now it was alm ost 10 p.m.. Mrs. Smith
tried to explain to the police she was trying to

get onto campus, and if she got off the bus she
would be stranded with no way home. The
police replied, “Call a friend.”
Mrs. Sm ith w ent on to say th at her
husband was at work with the car and that she
knew no one to call at that hour of the night.
W hen Mrs. Smith got off the bus, she gave the
police her nam e so she could file a complaint
against the driver.
The police officer said, “N o,” and instead
he used her nam e to do a background check
on her to see if she had a criminal record or
an outstanding warrant. W hen Mrs. Smith
asked if she could wait for another bus, the
police said no because he was the only driver
doing the route. Mrs. Smith even attem pted
to call the SIU E police, who told her in short,
“ Lady, fend for yourself.” Mrs. Smith began
walking hom e when a fellow A fro-A m erican
student, A lexander Fox, saw her. The young
m an offered her a ride because he knew that
black w om en have been rap ed enough
throughout colonial history. H e was much
aw are that by walking hom e alone at night
Mrs. Smith was a vulnerable target.
U pon receiving knowledge of this incident,
I was com pletely outraged. I im m ediately
called the
M adison
C ounty Transit
adm inistration and asked for a w ritten
apology signed by the bus driver and a full
refund of the bus fare. Until this m om ent, I
have heard nothing.
I write this editorial not only from the
perspective of a concerned husband, but also
as a concerned citizen. W hat type of message
does M adison C ounty Transit send when they
allow a young wom an to be taken off the bus
at ten o ’clock at night knowing that this is her
only way hom e? W hat does it m ean when
M adison C ounty Transit places the authority
in the hands of the driver to decide who shall
ride the bus? If the bus driver decided at any
given m om ent that he felt uncom fortable
with the presence of black students on the
bus, would he then be justified in asking all of
them to get off? D o black female students on
this cam pus have to w orry about being
stranded because of a racist bus driver?
I assume M adison Transit blew me off in
an effort to sweep this incident under the rug.
Well, so much oppression has been swept
under the rug that the rug now has been
elevated off the ground.I for one refuse to
add to the oppressive rubbish. It is easy for
m em bers of the S IU E adm inistration to
glamorize the im plem entation of this new bus
system, but how many of them actually ride
the bus? Is M adison Transit trying to turn the
hands of time back to the days of Rosa Parks?
Does SIU E even care that a black student’s
rights have been violated as a result of
M adison Transit, o r is the whole
adm inistration an active m em ber in the
“Sw eeping O ppression U n d er the Rug
C om m ittee”? Time alone will tell.

What ever happened
to being diverse?
'

>

I recently got the opportunity to attend a leadership
workshop dealing with the topic of diversity with some of the
top leaders on campus.
The w orkshop itself, entitled “Pathways to H arm ony,” was
pretty insightful. We did your run-of-the-m ill diversity training
stuff; shared experiences, discussed stereotypes, th at sort of
thing. No real solutions to increasing diversity on o u r campus,
but we did get a lot out in the open, though.
I also learned that, even though o ur students and faculty are
slightly m ore open to the issue of diversity and the acceptance
of others, there are a few people on cam pus who are still hiding
behind the ignorance of bias.
F or example, a student recently received a note tacked to
her door at the Residence H all that said, “ G o back hom e to St.
Louis, Nigger Bitch !” Pure ignorance. A few ignorant people
ruining life for the rest of us.
To these students I have to say, “W ake U p!!!” N o one is
exactly alike, th at is what m akes each and every one of us an
individual. Besides, if we were all .alike, same hair, sam e eyes,
same skin, life would be boring!
Learn to be diverse, to em brace o th er p eo p le’s culture and
gender. It is not just the PC thing to do, it is the right thing to
do. We are in a place of higher learning, we should act like it.
A nd the first place to Start the process of learning to be
diverse is in the mirror. Take a good look at yourself and notice
all the things that m ake you who you are. T hen, look even
deeper into the m irror—so deep that you reach your soul and
ask yourself, “W hat would I want som eone to say about me,
what w ouldn’t I want som eone to say?” A fter you answer that
question, rem em ber your answer and keep telling yourself that
answer w henever you get the urge to be closed-minded.
A wise m an once said, “A llow D ifference, R espect
Difference, Until Difference doesn’t m ake Any D ifference.”
Words to live by.

thing to note; I am a woman, and my title is either editor, or Ms.

‘War of the Wings’ a fun year-long
event for residence hall students
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
There is war in our midst.
No, Saddam Hussein is not on campus. This
war prom ises to be a friendly one, taking place
in the residence hall.
“W ar of the W ings” is a year-long
com petition sponsored by the Residence Hall
Program m ing Com m ittee (R H PC ). Residents
of each hall wing can earn points by attending
various events held throughout the year.
Students can earn points for their wings by
participating in wing com petitions, sponsoring
intram ural teams, contributing to a food drive,
passing safety inspections,not dam aging the
facilities and m aintaining the highest grade
point average.
Jennifer M eyer, vice p resid en t o f the
RH PC, created the concept and nam e for the
“War of the Wings.”
As a freshm an, M eyer said she feels like she
understands the needs and wants of the other
students.
The “W ar of the Wings” com petition is
designed to increase resident involvem ent in
all areas of campus and com m unity life. Most
im portantly, it is designed to be a fun
experience for residents.
Some residents have already taken part in a

co n test to nam e th eir wing. “The Divas,”
“ Q u iet R io t” and “ O ne W est” w ere the
w inners of the com petition.
C urrently, the students are working on
decorating their wings for Homecoming. In
addition, there will be a “Polyester Fiesta” on
F riday night w here residents will receive
points for ‘70s clothing and hairstyles. A diico
dance contest may also rack up some points
for savvy students.
“E veryone is really excited about it (W ar of
the Wings). But Friday will be the real test,”
M eyer said.
O ne problem with the com petition is the
desire stu dents have to go hom e on the
weekends. M eyer is w orking with the R H PC to
provide stu dents with reasons to stay on
campus.
A lthough no one will win a H arrier jet in
this com petition, the wing with the m ost points
at the end of the year will be rew arded. Prizes
will include carefully crafted t-shirts for each
resident of the wing, a wing party (chicken
wings perhaps?) and possession of a plaque.
L ater this m onth there will be a Halloween
H aunted Wing decorating contest, and a food
drive com petition som etim e in November.
M eyer also m entioned the possibility of
C hristm as caroling at the new nursing home
n ear Edwardsville High School som etime in
early Decem ber.

Recycle -------------------------------------- --------------------------from front page

recycling education program planned for Fall 1997. University Housing staff and student leaders
want to continue to increase the am ount recycled.
“It doubled from ‘95 to ‘96. and it would be great if we could do it again. But I would like to
see us increase by at least ten percent to fifteen percent,” Gluntz said.
Typically, people think of paper, plastics alum inum and glass when they think of recycling.
But the efforts can be much broader, and Housing is moving in other directions to increase
energy savings overall. Those efforts include:
• installing energy efficient w ater heaters, show er heads, appliances and condensing units
• new outdoor lighting fixtures that reduce energy consum ption and increase lighting levels
• pre-set therm ostats
• recycling laser printer cartridges and scrap metal.
• mulching scrap tree limbs for use in landscaping
• replacing oil-based paints with environm entally-friendly latex paint
G luntz said students can do their part by dropping recyclables in a Laidlaw container and
making m inor changes in their habits such as turning off the w ater while they are brushing their
teeth. Plastic grocery bags can be returned to Schnuck’s or N ational’s. Lights can be turned off
in unoccupied rooms.
Gluntz said he welcomes student’s suggestions on how H ousing can further improve its
recycling efforts.

D rive----------------------------from front page

voting in the 18-22 age group will be
consistent with elections of the past.
“You’re looking at 35 to 40 percent of that
age group voting in the upcoming elections,”
Farrell said.
A n other student who helped with the
voting drive, Stacy Enge, was proud of the
event.
“It went very well. O ver 100 students
alone came to vote in the Commons. Now, the
next step is to get students to actually vote,”
Enge, senior mass com m unications major,
said.
Wright, in preparing for the next phase
before elections, emphasizes the im portance

of voting.
“With voting you’re empowering citizens.
The event was very successful. Now students
must not only register, but vote also,” Wright
said.
There are still several places on campus
where students can register to vote until the
voting registration deadline—the B ursar’s
Office in the Rendlem an Building and the
business office in the University Center.
T here are also personnel on campus who can
register students: Tom May in the University

L i n d a B l a i r ‘e x o r c i s e s ’ H e r R i g h t s
By Corey Stulce
For the Alestle
W hatever happened to that nice little
girl who was possessed by the devil?
After a recent de-em ergence from the
public eye, Linda Blair is back, with a
vengeance. Don’t look for her at the
local multiplex, though. Blair’s got a
whole new career saving the pets of
America, and it’s a full time job.
Blair was tossed into stardom at a very
young age with the smash motion
picture, “The Exorcist.” Since the film
was such a hit, acting was put on the
forefront, while Blair’s dream of
becom ing a veterinarian was pushed to
the back b u rner.
“It was its own roller-coaster rid e,”
said Blair. “It just sort of happened.”
Blair did all of h er acting in New York
City, and didn’t come out to Hollywood
until the film opened.
“I was like, ‘Whoa!’ You’re fascinated
by it, but it’s a little different now. There
was still some glamour, still some
Hollywood sparkle, back then. It’s all
gone now,” said Blair.

She continued to make movies through Democrat, but I don’t care what you are,

I’m not saying that H artm ann got

he did break the law and he is going

Gilman leads Cougars
past Missouri Baptist
Cougars im prove to 14-7 with fo u r set victory
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor

Todd Spann/Alesrie

The SIUE volleyball team continued to play well when they defeated
Missouri Baptist 17-15, 15-7, 6-15, 15-10. They are shown here
playing University Southern Indiana last Saturday.

Michelle G ilm an’s 24 kills led the SIU E
volleyball team past N A IA pow erhouse
Missouri Baptist.
Gilm an w ent into the contest as the
nation’s leading blocker. O n Tuesday, she
showed that she can dom inate on offense as
well as on defense in a 17-15,15-7, 6-15,1510 victory over Missouri Baptist in St. Louis.
“We played aggressive volleyball,” head
coach Sandy M ontgom ery said on
W ednesday morning. “We showed a lot of
intensity in this m atch.”
D ecatur’s Jill Stenger and Aviston’s Julie
Litteken each had 10 kills to go along with
G ilm an’s season high tying mark.

“Missouri B aptist is a top ranked team in
the N A IA . They were 19-1 coming into our
m atch,” M ontgom ery said. “We played
tough thanks to some outstanding individ­
ual perform ances.”
The Cougars are 14-7 on the season and
6-1 in the G reat Lakes Valley Conference
with their next three games being against
GLVC foes.
“ It was good to get a win against a tough
team ,” M ontgom ery said. “It m ade us play
hard and that is what we need to get us
ready for the upcom ing conference
matches.”
S IU E will host Indianapolis on
W ednesday of next week and will continue
their hom e stand against St. Joseph’s on
Oct. 11 and IU PU -Fort Wayne on Oct. 12.

H e was then kicked out of the
program only to be reinstated
after missing only 6 games and
then was selected sixth in the
N FL D raft by the St. Louis
Rams. H e will doubtlessly go
on to fortune and possibly
even success.
The victim, K ate M cEwen,
had her athletic scholarship
discontinued
by
the
U niversity
of
N ebraska.
W om en’s coach A ngela Beck
has
said
on
television
interview s
th at
th ree
C om huskers were told their
athletic scholarships w ere
being discontinued due to
lack of progress on the court.
B ut M cEw en could get a
chance to regain her scholar­

ship if she chooses to try to
m ake the 1996-97 team as a
walk-on. She is currently pon­
dering
th ree
consolation
prizes which also include the
opportunity to stay on the
C ornhuskers as w om en's
basketball team m anager. H er
academ ic scholarship will
continue.
Still, the
inequity
is
amazing. The brutalizer makes
m illions,
the
victim
is
m etaphorically dragged down
the stairs by the school. A nd if
this isn’t retaliation for her
having the nerve to accuse a
football god who plays for
Tom Osborne, it sure looks
like it. In either case it stinks.
