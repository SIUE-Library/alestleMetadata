Chris Peters, Bill Hatch and Jim Korunka discuss plans for the entrance to the Arboretum. Phase one o f the Donat G.
Myers Arboretum is to be finished in about two weeks with an opening ceremony on July 7. The Arboretum funds were
raised by SlUE’s Foundation Administration, a volunteer fundraising organization that raises money for special projects.

Summer construction develops new attractions
along SlUE’s woodland bike trails, improving area

M ore measures are being
taken to enhance the natural
beauty of SlU E’s campus with
the construction of the Donal G.
Myers Arboretum.
The Arboretum is being built
to help promote the naturalistic
setting of the campus, as well as
provide both an aesthetic and
academic vehicle for students and
the community.
The A rboretum is not a
new idea. It was originally
proposed by Dr. Donal G. Myers
ten years ago.
Kathy
Turner
of
the
university’s
Foundation
A dm inistration cites lack of
funds and people able to make
the initiative happen as the
reasons why the arboretum
w asn’t further developed. But
two
years
ago,
form er
Foundation President Chuck
Tosovsky made it one of his goals
to raise the funds needed to build
the arboretum in M yers’ honor.

“It was a dream o f Dr.
Myers, but no one was able to
take it and m ove forw ard,”
Turner said.
Turner credits Tosovsky with
making the project finally
happen. She said that it w asn’t so
much that the project had been
ignored for the past ten years as it
was in actuality a “slow process.”
Along with Rita Hardy,
Turner said that Tosovsky helped
make phase one of the $300,000
project happen.
Turner said that, through the
Foundation’s involvement and by
identifying the arboretum as a
project, they were able to make
M yers’ dream a reality.
The board o f trustees
approved the building o f the
arboretum which would feature a
bridge spanning over the lake in
the arboretum, the building and
cleaning of pathways, and the
establishm ent o f the actual
arboretum.
The arboretum is located
along the form er Delyte W.
Morris bike trail, near the Alpha
Phi Alpha Fraternity House. The
arboretum continues through the

pathways and trails, including
the new bridge being built over
the lake. It is the lake which
can be see while driving into
Cougar Village.
A ccording to U niversity
News Services, the bridge is
being constructed out of North
Carolina pine by Enwood
Structures o f Tennessee and
weighs nearly 20 tons. The bridge
will span 100 feet. The bridge’s
approach will comply with all
ADA regulations
for new
structures on campus.
Along the trail, stone
benches have been erected
dedicated to the people who
donated to the arboretum, as well
as benches in honor of former
Foundation presidents.
Phase one of the arboretum
is expected to be completed by
July 7. There will be a dedication
for the opening of the arboretum
and its founders.
Although the area is under
construction, the arboretum will
be open for students to continue
to walk through.
A ccording
to
Turner,
discussions are currently taking
place to help incorporate the
aesthetics of the arboretum with

academic units on campus.
Turner said she hopes the
biology, art and other programs
on campus will be able to utilize
the area. The Foundation hopes
that eventually environm ental
studies projects can be done in
the arboretum, as well as projects
for
art
students
studying
landscape art. There are also
future hopes for community use
of the grounds for field trips for
area schools.
“Our goal is for it to be used
for academ ic and aesthetic
reasons,” Turner said.
The
Foundation
Administration is the fund raising
vehicle for the university. They
identify projects such as the
arboretum and the greenhouse
built last year and work to secure
funds for the projects. They hold
annual fund drives and contact
alumni to generate funds. It is
made
up
of
com m unity
volunteers with John Oeltjen as
the current president and Brad
Hewitt as the acting chief
executive
officer
for
the
Foundation.

Its purpose was to help
promote the booming O ’Fallon
area, but the publishers at the
O ’Fallon Progress/Base News
newspapers didn’t see it
that way.
SIUE
photojournalism
graduate
student.
Bob
Fehringer, was released from
his position on June 2 as a
contract photographer for Base
News, a publication out o f
O ’Fallon, 111.
Fehringer was released by
Base News publisher, Cecil
“Bud” Ross. Fehringer stated in
his letter to the military and
civilian personnel of Scott Air
Force Base that he had been
“asked to leave due to what the
boss considers a conflict of
interest because o f a new
venture I am pursuing.”
In a letter from Ross
term inating
F ehringer’s
position at the Progress, he
said that his position with the
new publication will present “a
myriad of ethical and technical
questions
concerning
proprietary
rights
to
photographic m aterials when
covering events for both
publications.
This
is an
unacceptable situation.”
But Fehringer believes that
his newsletter will not be in
direct com petition with the
O ’Fallon Progress, saying that
his publication comes out only
twice a month and is targeted
toward different advertisers.
“Representing a direct
com petitor
in
the
same
geographical area is confusing
to the general public as
to whom you represent,”
Ross said in F ehringer’s
termination letter
W orking
for
both
publications, especially if they
are in direct com petition with
each other, w ould cause
serious ethical and possibly
legal
im plications,
but
Fehringer believes that his
publication
is
not
in
competition with the Progress.

The newsletter is a public
relations newsletter for the City
o f O ’Fallon, w ith Fehringer
and Deb Cooper as its editors
and founders.
Fehringer and Cooper own
and operate the O ’Fallon based
Veterans M edia LLC, which
published its first issue of the
new city publication, called
the O ’Fallon City Record,
on Monday.
A ccording
to
an
advertisem ent
released
by
Fehringer, the O ’Fallon City
Record will feature the coverage
o f city

about
city
services,
city
departments and city employees,
Main Street O ’Fallon and other
articles and community news. It
will be published bi-weekly.
Fehringer said that the
publication will be mostly a way
to help prom ote the City of
O ’Fallon, as well as keep its
residents inform ed on the
positive
attributes
and
developments o f their city.

In an O ’Fallon Progress
story run on the June 1
city council meeting concerning
the subsidizing of the newsletter,
Ross said, “We have no
problem with the new sletter
but
are
opposed
to
government subsidization o f a
private
business
in
a
competitive m arket.”
At the m eeting, the city
council discussed the possible
funding issues and the amount of
government involvement in the
newsletter.
Fehringer said that the City
Record is going fo r entirely
different advertisers and believes
the alleged competition will be
healthy for the news market in
O ’Fallon. F ehringer also said
many residents complain about
the
Progress
and
it’s
shortcomings as a publication.
The city council of O ’Fallon
tried to m ake it clear at the
meeting that the city of O ’Fallon
will not have any direct control
over the new publication, but
there is a possibility that some
funds will have to be spent to
help the newsletter successfully
gain its footing.
The O ’Fallon Progress/Base

A land of famous firsts Letters to the editor
Editorials from around the
and inequality for all
nation and world

This week while watching the CBS evening news,
a story was run on a black man who had just been
appointed CEO of Fortune 500 company Fannie Mae, a
corporation specializing in housing loans. CBS reported
that he was the first African-American ever to become
Danielle CEO of a company of this caliber. The broadcaster
Bofl spoke of the shattering of a glass ceiling that had
separated African-Americans from top management positions for
years.
As pleased with this as I was. I found it sad that for a nation of
people that has been living in America for over 400 years, AfricanAmericans are still having firsts. Colin Powell was the first ever
African-American to serve as Joint Chief of Staff. Carol MoselyBraun was the first African-American female senator. Clarence
Thomas is only the second African-American to serve on the
Supreme Court after the first African-American served, Througood
Marshall. Dr. Joyceln Elders was the first black attorney general.
Freeman Bosely Jr. was the first black mayor of St. Louis, and
Clarence Harmon is the second. Most of these firsts and seconds that
I named just happened over the past ten years. All these firsts and
many others happened not in my m other’s or grandmother’s lifetime,
but in mine.
In 400 years, nothing should be still new or surprising, but it is
still fascinating and a rarity to see an African-American man or
woman win an Academy Award or own a billion dollar corporation
(the TLC Beatrice Corporation). In 400 years, some progress should
have been made, but there were many gaps and pratfalls in the way.
Slavery, the birth, death and re-birth of the Ku Klux Klan, a few
bloody summers, throw in a stock market crash, a war here and
there, some Jim Crow laws and a civil rights movement, and w e’ve
got quite a few roadblocks on the highway to equality.
The fact is that in many aspects, although African-Americans
have helped build this country and are deeply entrenched in
America’s psyche and social structure, they are still not part of the
mainstream. There are still firsts and abnormalities against the norm
of African-American social structure which is still confined by the
glass ceiling that the new CEO of Fannie Mae was able to put a
scratch on.
The new CEO proves that there is progress, but it also proves
that its a slow progress. Slavery ended with the Civil War, but it
takes more than a war to make people accept the fact that AfricanAmericans are Americans as well and deserve to be treated as such.
Unlike the shattering of the glass that CBS heard, I think I heard
a scratch. A scratch that I’m proud of and one that gives me hope, but
a scratch nevertheless.
Hopefully seeing someone succeed will inspire others to go to
college and strive in the same way. Everyone can’t be a CEO, but
everyone can be educated, and everyone can try. And that goes for
everyone, not just African-Americans, but all Americans. If a black
man from humble beginnings can get there fighting both poverty and
racism, maybe the American Dream could be obtainable to all in the
near future.

Danielle Belton

Political Correctness gone
too far?
Middle schooler T.J. West
violated one of the Derby, Kan.
school district’s cardinal rules:
Don’t draw, write or possess
anything that school officials
consider racially offensive. So, for
drawing a Confederate flag, T.J.
found himself suspended from
school for three days.
But in imposing what they
thought was fitting punishment,
Derby officials seem to have placed
the Politically Correct Handbook
above the Constitution.
Now an argument might be
made that T.J. West should have
known better than to violate a
school rule by sketching a
Confederate flag. And common
sense and good manners suggest
against doing anything that would
blatantly offend others.
But the First Amendment
doesn’t require good taste or good
sense in protecting speech or
expression. And to put symbols on a
taboo list, as Derby officials have
done, violates that fundamental
First Amendment right — the right
to say what you want. And that, like
it or not, includes the right to say,
write or do things that many, even
the majority, may disagree with or
take offense at.
Despite some attempts to put a
political label on the case, the Derby
policy isn’t a conservative or liberal
issue. It is rather a question of
whether a First Amendment right
can be suspended. Derby officials
apparently think so. The federal
courts, we suspect, won’t.

That’s good news to the public,
which has been tremendous in
helping law enforcement bring
down makers of the highly
addictive, synthetic drug.
Missouri
lawmakers
are
confident they have passed the
toughest anti-meth law in the
nation. Gov. Mel Carnahan signed
into law Wednesday new changes
increasing the felony punishments
for meth makers and distributors.
The fiscal year 1999 budget will
contain $3.5 million in anti-meth
funding, mostly for new law
enforcement
equipment
and
training.
Law enforcement officers say
the need for tougher penalties
emerged because the popularity of
the drug has grown alarmingly in
recent years. But lawmakers also
credit an increased public outcry
against the dangers of meth for
helping bring about changes in the
law.
That’s been evident with the
Missouri State Highway Patrol’s
meth hotline (1-888-823-METH).
Since it became operational earlier
this year, the confidential tip line
has fielded over 200 calls from the
public on meth lab operations and
distribution in Missouri. The patrol
says close to 190 of those calls have
led to legitimate investigations and
arrests...
Citizens have been the eyes
and ears of uncovering meth in
Missouri. That role should not
diminish under this new law.

Nothing, its seems, is more
sensational and sinister in the U.S.
capital than a plot by China’s
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to

The murder of innocence
Remember
the
George
Washington High School “skip
day” picnic in Charleston, W. Va., at
which several students and visitors
carried pistols, and two boys were
shot to death?
The
slaughter
of
schoolchildren is a price America
pays for being a gun-polluted
society.
The recent mass shooting at an
Oregon school was the latest in a
never-ending string of horrors. Two
days earlier, a Tennessee honor
student shot a classmate to death on
the school parking lot, because the
classmate was dating his ex­
girlfriend.
This is what happens in a
society saturated with 200 million
guns. Any child can obtain a
weapon and use it in a moment of
childish rage.
This is what happens in a
society where the powerful “right to
bear arms” lobby cows politicians,
making them afraid to take any
steps to protect people from the gun
danger.
How long will America endure
this madness?

The college experience has
changed quite a bit over the
decades. I think it used to be that
a university would train you for
a specific career by giving you
specific skills. O f course now it
seems that isn’t enough.
I don’t know whether it's
because the world become so
much more competitive, or if
companies want to hire fewer
people to do more jobs, or that
attention spans have become so
short that people need to do
different jobs to be happy.
I vote for the latter, at least
that’s how I fit into the equation.
By studying Mass
Communications, I have learned
sprinklings of writing,
advertising, public relations,
technical training, marketing and
so on. These classes have
prepared me (somewhat) for
numerous jobs in various fields.
For me, it’s a plus because I go
insane in monotonous situations.
I need challenges and outlets
where I can be creative. I’m not
happy doing the same thing day
in day out.
That’s why I think the college
experience should change even
more. I think every day of
classes should prepare students
for a completely different job.
Let’s face it, the important tips in
any job can be picked up in a
day, everything else is just on the
job trial and error.
Just think of it, one day you
could learn to be a mariachi
singer, the next a member of the
Japanese Yakuza. Friday could
even be split into two easier
careers, like a fireman in the
morning and an investment
banker in the afternoon.
Of course, a full year course
of resume writing would be
required the last year. Each one
would probably average 200
pages or so.

Feels like somebody’s watching you...

aquarium , com plete with townspeople,
businesses and a computer-controlled weather
system. It’s the brainchild of a demented
producer named C hristof played by Ed

Harris. But, of course, all good things must
come to an end.
Little hints tell Truman that something is
amiss in his little world. That’s when the
movie takes an eerie turn and that’s when
Carrey gets to be Carrey. Truman goes a little
crazy, which allows Carrey to act zany, and
do his little faces and voices that masses
seem to love. Fortunately, director Peter Weir
kept a semi-tight reign on Carrey, and his
antics don’t steal the movie.
The story is very original and has some
very interesting aspects. But, unfortunately,
the story overshadows almost everything else,
including the characters. We only get to see
hints o f what Truman and Christof are really

like. It is hinted that Christof’s motivation is
to create a world that he envisions as prefect.
A world where he can live vicariously
through Truman. But, that never becomes
very clear.
There are some dark aspects to the film
as well. Truman’s world is commanded in a
very Nazi-esque manor, in which the actions
and emotions of the actors in his life are
completely controlled and monitored. This
could have been a very frightening film, but
some efforts are made to keep portions of it
light and funny. Unfortunately those two
aspects make it uneven.
But, the acting and directing is swell, and
by the end, everyone should be rooting for
Truman.

10, 1998 ♦

Cardinals left-hander tired of being hurt
ST. LOUIS (A P) — The
prospect
of
starting
a
rehabilitation stint next week
doesn’t have Donovan Osborne
doing cartwheels.
So many
things
have
happened to the St. Louis
Cardinals left-hander, he wonders
when the misery will finally end.
“I t’s no fun w atching
everybody else go out there
and do their job, and you’re
just
sitting
there
and
w atching,” O sborne said. “It
drives you crazy.”
With good reason. Since late
in the 1993 season, he’s been on
and off the disabled list six times.
The Cardinals are getting little

return from the three-year,
$12.75 million deal he signed off
a career-best 13-9 season in 1996.
Osborne was limited to 14 starts
last year due to a groin injury and
hernia, and won three of them. So
far this year, he’s 1-2 with a 2.64
ERA in five starts and has been
on the DL since M ay 8. His
absence this year is all the more
painful since he’s one o f three
starters w ho’ve been knocked out
of the rotation.
“It’s
pretty
hard
to
overcom e,” general m anager
Walt Jocketty said o f Osborne,
Alan Benes and Matt M orris, the
three missing arms. “It’s not easy
to replace these guys.”

O sborne’s problem s began
with shoulder surgery that
knocked him out o f all of 1994
and part o f ‘95. Since then,
problems as much off the field as
on have sidelined him.
In 1996, he turned his car
into the path of a pickup truck
shortly before spring training
began, suffering broken ribs that
held him back until April 17. In
1997, he gashed the thumb on his
pitching hand during the team ’s
celebration for winning the NL
Central when he reached for a
champagne bottle and picked up
broken glass instead.
A groin problem kept him
out most of last season and most

of spring training this season.
The groin still bothers him,
although he could pitch, if not for
a sore shoulder.
Osborne banged into the
wall running to make a catch
during batting
practice, a
thoughtless act, but said that
had nothing to do with his
latest injury.
“The things h e ’s had are
all legitim ate,” Jocketty said.
“When he’s healthy, he’s one of
the best left-handers in the
game. It’s ju st a m atter of
keeping him healthy.”
Osborne is puzzled by his
run of bad luck. Before ‘93, he’d
never been injured.

“Som etim es it’s tough to
keep going,” Osborne said. “You
do everything you can to help the
team, even lead cheers, and it’s
not nearly enough.”
Osborne has done his best to
keep in shape during his
seemingly endless recuperation
period. On Tuesday he and
Morris threw long-toss for the
first time, and on Friday he’ll
work off the mound at Busch
Stadium. Next stop, the minors.
“I’m here for one reason, and
that’s to pitch,” he said. “It’s very
tough to keep yourself up.
“I ju st w ant to get back
out there.”

Michael Jordan pumps $10 billion into economy
NEW YORK (A P) —
Michael Jordan has had a $10
billion im pact on the U.S.
economy, Fortune m agazine
estimates.
From peddling sneakers,
underwear and cologne, Jordan
also has an influence on rising
television ratings and gate
receipts for basketball team s,
increased sales o f N ational
Basketball
A ssociation
paraphernalia and a lineup of
sports videos and books.
The sports business is “a
fundamentally different industry
from the one he cam e into,”
the magazine quoted the National
Basketball A ssociation’s chief

m arketer,
Rick
W elts,
as
saying. “How you figure out
what he benefited from based on
the industry’s growth and what
he contributed to the growth of
the industry is a question for
the ages.”
The stats for Jordan, who
begins the 1998 NBA Finals
W ednesday for perhaps the last
time, cover a wide range. He was
the league’s most valuable player
five times and scoring champion
10 times.
Since
1990, when the
Jordan-led Chicago Bulls took
their first of five championships,
television ratings, ticket sales,
television rights fees, NBA

retail sales and player salaries
have all risen.
With help from outside
econom ists, Fortune estim ates
the Jordan persona and product
line has been worth $5.2 billion
to sneaker and sports apparel
m anufacturer N ike Inc. Other
companies whose products he
endorses got an estim ated $408
million lift.
The magazine also credits
$3.1 billion in increased sales
o f N B A -licensed caps, shirts,
jerseys and related objects
since Jordan entered the league
in 1984.
Then there’s the hundreds of
millions more in added NBA

attendance and TV and cable
revenue attributed to Jordan’s
draw ing
power,
Fortune
magazine said in a cover story of
its June 22 edition, which reaches
newsstands Tuesday.
Jordan’s
sports
videos,
which have sold more than 4
million copies, have generated
$80 million in sales. His movie
“Space Jam ,” sharing the big
screen with Bugs Bunny and
other anim ated W arner Bros,
pals, brought in $230 million at
the box office and $209 million
in video sales, the report said.
Average NBA salaries have
risen from the low six-figures in
1983-84, the season before

Jordan’s debut, to above $2.6
million this season.
Even Jordan’s agent, David
Falk, is cashing in. Falk’s
agency recently was sold for
about $100 million, and Fortune
estimated half of that represents
the “Jordan Effect.”
At the end o f the day,
Jordan is m ystified by it all,
Fortune said.
“I never really envisioned
myself having any kind o f major
impact on people,” Jordan told
the magazine. “Even now, when I
see kids wearing my shoes, it’s
kind of wild. Sometimes I still
feel shocked.”

As the "Worm” turns: What’s up with Rodman
C H IC A G O (A P) — He
arrives late for gam es, sulks on
the bench and ju st isn ’t the same
rebounding fool the C hicago
Bulls know and love. A nd, in the
surest sign Dennis R odm an is in
a major funk, he h asn’t changed
his hair color in weeks.
So w hat gives w ith The
Worm this tim e?
“ He is stru g g lin g with
com ing o ff the bench and
accepting what his role is right
now,” C hicago coach Phil
Jackson said. “He will have a
different role in the series
coming up.”
The Bulls play the Utah

Jazz in the N BA Finals,
which begin W ednesday in Salt
Lake City.
“It is going to be his turn to
shine,” Jackson added. “If we
are going to win, h e’s going to
have to play great.”
Great is the last word that
would describe R odm an’s play
in the Eastern Conference finals
against the Indiana Pacers. He
averaged 9.8 rebounds a game as
the Bulls won the series 4-3.
In G am e 7 on Sunday, he
had a paltry six rebounds,
all in the first half. Even
Jud B uechler, w h o ’s barely
played in the last two months,

managed to grab five.
In the reg u lar season,
Rodman averaged 15 rebounds
a gam e, good enough for
his
seventh
consecutive
rebounding title.
It’s no secret Rodman was
less than thrilled with Jackson’s
game plan against Indiana. By
starting Toni Kukoc in six of
the seven gam es, Jackson said
he was trying to give Chicago
a
defensive
spark,
not
punish Rodman.
Except for game one, when
Rodman led the Bulls at halftime
with nine points, he was more of
a dud than a spark. He was in

foul trouble alm ost every game
and picked up two technicals.
Then there was his amusing
new gam e called “Fetch the
W orm.” W hen the Bulls were at
home, Rodman spent the first
few minutes of each half in the
locker room, riding the exercise
bike, running or m aybe ju st
counting his landscape of
tattoos, and Jackson had to send
an assistant trainer to get him.
And now com e his old foes,
the Utah Jazz and their Mormon
fans. Rodman isn ’t exactly at his
best when it comes to Utah. He
drew a $50,000 fine — the
largest in NBA history — and

the furor o f just about everyone
after using
vulgarities
to
describe the M ormons.
He eventually apologized,
but in true Rodm an fashion, he
claim ed he hadn’t known the
M orm ons w ere a religious
group. He said he was just upset
at the Jazz fans for yelling at him
and making obscene gestures.
D on’t worry about Rodman,
M ichael Jordan said. W hen it
com es tim e to play, Jordan
said he has no doubt Rodman
will be ready.
“D ennis’ value is going to
be m easured in his energy level
and attitude,” Jordan said.

Carlos Moya captures the French Open on Sunday, beating friend
PARIS (AP) — They may
not have played scintillating
tennis, but Carlos M oya and Alex
Corretja ended the French Open
on a happy note: tw o buddies
smiling and hugging, then
knocking around a soccer ball
with Pele on center court.
Still, the m en’s final, won
by Moya over a shakier and
less versatile Corretja, was an
anticlimax. This year, the drama

was on the w om en’s side, and
much of it cam e before the
final weekend.
But the last two days did
make one thing clear: Spanish
players are expanding their
dominance on the red clay of
Roland Garros.
At 21, Moya seems to have
the brightest future o f them all.
He stormed into prominence
at the 1997 A ustralian Open,

getting all the way to the final
before losing to Pete Sampras.
Though the Spaniards grow
up on clay courts, M oya has a
better serve and m ore varied
w eapons than som e of his
compatriots. That showed in his
decisive 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 victory
Sunday. H e’ll move to the No. 5
ranking this week.
“If I win Wimbledon, maybe
I’m No. 1, huh?” he said with a

wink, knowing his chances of
winning on grass are remote.
One thing is obvious about
the Spanish players: they are
good friends, and that solidarity
helps them on the tour. They
travel together, play video games
together, practice together, party
together — and win together.
The players’ box, often a site
o f tense coexistence between
rival clans, looked like a family

picnic on Sunday. M oya’s family
hugged C o rretja’s when the
match was over. Arantxa Sanchez
Vacario,
crow ned
w om en’s
cham pion a day earlier, was
there, and so was her mother.
Everybody was happy.
In fact, loser Corretja was
pretty cheery, too. He hurdled the
net
after
the
match
to
congratulate his friend.

Brazilian soccer star causes stir at French Open for Safin
PARIS (AP) — W hile rising
Russian star Marat Safin played
his fourth-round match, on center
court, he was being watched by a
superstar — Ronaldo, the
Brazilian soccer sensation.
W hat’s more, Ronaldo was
briefly joined by the teen queen
of the French O pen, Anna
Koumikova, who lost earlier in
the day.
After
a
few
gam es,
Koumikova kissed Ronaldo on
the cheek and left.
It didn’t take long for the
crowd to notice the soccer star on

the steps of the dignitaries box.
They started chanting Ronaldo’s
name during the changeover.
Though Safin had just lost
the first set, he managed a big
smile and a thum bs-up to
Ronaldo:
“I’d never seen
Ronaldo that close before.”
GUGA: Last year’s winner,
Gustavo Kuerten, also looked in
on Ronaldo at center court. The
audience had some trouble
spotting Guga under his new
dreadlocks.
Kuerten had said: “If I win

the
tournam ent,
I’ll
get
dreadlocks.” Even though he
lost to M arat Safin in the
second round, the idea had
already taken hold.
Guga followed up on his
vow. He got his dreadlocks at the
exclusive Jacques Dessanges
salon at Roland Garros, where
players can get free haircuts.
ANTI-WILLIAMS
BANDWAGON:
No.

wom en’s seed Iva
Majoli
jum ped on the anti-W illiam s
bandwagon Monday when she

was asked about the match
between Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
and Serena Williams.
Sanchez Vicario won that
match, and said afterward she
was upset at W illiams’ attitude.
Sanchez Vicario accused the 16year-old Williams of not showing
respect for her opponent.
“Serena and Venus have
their own attitude,” Majoli said
of the Williams sisters. “They’re
like, ‘Yeah, w e’re the best’ ... I’m
sure it’s going to change in a year
or two when they grow up.”

M ASHED
POTATOES:
Hicham Arazi from M orocco
beat Alberto Berasategui on
Monday in a match in which
most serves stayed under 150 kph
(93 mph) for both players,
unusually slow for the top men.
When asked how his serve
measures up, Arazi had some
dietary tips for his questioners.
“I’m able to serve more than
1 5 0 .1 even reached 201 kph (125
mph) at one occasion. I’ve never
been above 150? I can’t believe
it,” he said. “I’ll need to eat more
mashed potatoes tonight to catch
up on muscles.”

Loudoun girls balk at baseball league’s "hostess” pitch
PURCELLVILLE, Va. (AP)
— When the Babe Ruth League
decided to hold its national
World Series in Loudoun County
this summer, organizers assumed
they w ould have no problem
finding teen-age girls to show
ballplayers their com m unities
and cheer for them.
But many girls say the job
sounds sexist. W hat’s more,
many young female athletes say
they will be too busy competing
in summer sports of their own to
serve as “hostesses.” The girls,
ages 15 to 17, are supposed to

attend all their team ’s games,
cheerleading and helping to
decorate the stands.
“You can consider me a
feminist, but when they told me
about that, I said, ‘N ope,’”
Brooke Hoeltzel, 16, told The
W ashington Post. The junior
plays basketball and tennis at
Loudoun Valley High School in
Purcellville, where the World
Series will take place in August.
The Babe Ruth League, an
international organization based
in Trenton, N.J., oversees
hundreds of local baseball

leagues for boys. Its World Series
dates to 1952.
“Hostesses” are required to
wear a baseball uniform with a
skirt instead of pants. The
league is running out of time to
order the outfits.
“The way the hostesses are
portrayed is a wimpy, girly
image,” said Jennifer Potts, 17, a
Loudoun Valley junior who plays
softball and volleyball. “If you
have hostesses, you should have
them
do
som ething
more
updated. Some o f the stuff
they’re asked to do is lame.”

Babe
Ruth
League
Commissioner Robert P. Faherty
Jr. said the program aims to make
the visiting boys feel comfortable
during the World Series and to
give each team a “built-in rooting
section.” The league plans to
assign three hostesses to each of
the nine visiting teams and six
hostesses to the Loudoun team.
Organizers say they are way
behind schedule in recruiting the
33 hostesses they need. They
have placed ads in local
newspapers
and
made

announcem ents at area high
schools, but only about a dozen
girls have volunteered.
“It’s kind of w eird,” said
Alethea Lee, 17, a junior at Notre
Dame Academy in Middleburg.
“Teen-age guys don’t need girls
in skirts waiting on them .”
But Sarah Horn, 15, a
sophomore at Loudoun Valley,
said she signed up to be a hostess
because “it sounded like a lot of
fun, getting to be a part of the
whole thing.”

Tennis--------------

and he’s been trying a lot longer.
This year, his ninth try, was his
worst loss ever. He went down in
the second round to a 21-year-old
from Paraguay, Ramon Delgado,
ranked 97th in the world.
Another
interesting
development was the fastimproving
W illiams
sisters.
They both did well here —
Venus reached the quarterfinals
before losing to Hingis, and
Serena lost a tight fourth-round
match to eventual champion
Sanchez Vicario.
Hingis’ easy defeat of Venus
Williams put to rest, for a
moment, the talk of a rivalry for
the ages. But there is time; both
are only 17.
The 16-year-old Serena,
meanwhile, looked strong until
she came within two points of
victory over Sanchez Vicario.
Then she folded, showing she’s
got some more maturing to do.
The best story among the
women, though, was Seles. She
came to Roland Garros to get
away from painful memories at
home of her late father and coach,
Karolj Seles, who died three
weeks ago of cancer.
She might have been
expected to lose early, given how
distracted she’d been. But instead,
she turned adversity into her ally.
Her straight-set victory over
Hingis, powered by laser-sharp
groundstrokes that constantly
brushed the lines, was one of the
best matches of the tournament.
Wearing her father’s ring
around her neck, Seles lost a
tough three-set final to Sanchez
Vicario who, in a gracious
acceptance speech, said, “I’m so
sorry I beat you.”
Not all the excitement was on
the wom en’s side. A Russian

qualifier named M arat Safin,
ranked 116th, cam e out of
nowhere to beat Andre Agassi and
defending
champion

Gustavo Kuerten before losing in
the fourth round to local hero
Cedric Pioline.
Safin has a killer serve, a

feather-light drop shot and a
dry sense of humor. At only 18, he
looks to have a very bright future,
too.

from page 6

“I ’m really happy because
I’ve been playing well for the last
two weeks, and I lost to a really
good friend of m ine,” he said.
Fans reserved their biggest
cheers for Pele, who presented
the w inner’s trophy and then
joined both players for an
im prom ptu
rom p
w ith
a
soccer ball.
“The feelings I ’m having
right now are unbelievable,” said
Moya, who won $650,000. “I
cannot explain with words. You
have to feel it. You have to be
there.”
M oya, seeded 12th, and
Corretja, seeded 14th, reached
the final after the m en’s field was
decim ated
early
in
the
tournam ent. Top-seeded Pete
Sampras lost in the second round
and No. 2 Petr Korda in the first.
Moya ousted No. 3 M arcelo Rios
in the quarterfinals.
The w om en’s field, by
contrast, stayed strong until the
end, and had more than its usual
share of compelling stories.
There was the curious
m eltdow n o f M artina Hingis,
who may be developing a Pete
Sam pras-like allergy to the
Parisian clay.
Hingis lost last year in the
finals to Iva Majoli. She then
won the next three Grand Slams,
but back here this year, she
folded in the semis to a newly
energized Monica Seles.
“ I ju st probably put too
much pressure on m yself,” she
said. “I really want to win this
tournam ent.”
Sam pras probably would
advise her to stop wanting it.
He, too, has never won here,
