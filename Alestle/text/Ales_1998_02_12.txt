Total enrollment for spring
semester at SIUE has increased
slightly this year with a total of
10,540 students, compared with
10,508 students a year ago.
The
most
significant
increase was in full-time
enrollment, which was a 3.6
percent gain of 235 students for a
total of 6,803 students, according
to Christa Oxford, acting
assistant vice chancellor for
Enrollment Management.
According to Oxford, the
freshman class gained 91
students and every undergraduate
class increased in size except for

seniors. She says that one reason
for the 69-student decline in the
senior class was the unusually
large number of graduates
in December.
The number of new enrollees
in the graduate program was up
by 15 students and there were 14
reentering students in the
graduate program as well. The
total number of continuing
students in the graduate studies
dropped by 115. This is
corresponding to a national
decline in graduate students
attributed
to
the
low
unemployment rate according to
Oxford. The total number of
graduate students enrolled for the
semester at SIUE is 2,404.

National Condom Day emphasizes importance of sexual health
■ BY RENEE H O LLER
NEWS STRINGER
“Love Me Safely” is the
theme for National Condom Day
1998 on Valentine’s Day, Feb. 14.
According to the American
Social
Health
Association,
Valentine’s Day is the perfect day
to emphasize that loving
someone involves protecting the
sexual health of both partners,
even though it is a sensitive and
often embarrassing subject.
“Because STDs are so often
symptomless, sex partners must
talk to one another about any risk
for STDs, even if neither person

has
symptoms,”
Linda
Alexander, ASHA president said.
ASHA recommends that
both partners be tested for STDs
if either has had unprotected sex
at any time. Testing is available at
a physician’s office, clinic or
health department. Partners
should also use condoms
correctly every time they have
sex to help protect against STDs.
Alexander emphasized that
abstinence is the only completely
safe choice.
“For those who are having
sex, unless both partners are 100
percent certain that they are free
of infection, condoms are
essential,” Alexander said.

According to the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention,
it is estimated that 12 million new
cases of STDs are reported in the

U.S. every year, with two-thirds
occurring in people under 25.
The CDC also reported that five
of the 10 most frequently
reported infectious diseases in
the U.S. - chlamydia, gonorrhea,
AIDS, syphilis and hepatitis B
are transmitted by sexual contact.
Condoms are considered to be
highly effective in protecting
against chlamydia, gonorrhea,
HIV/AIDS, syphilis and other
STDs that are passed via body
fluids. According to the CDC,
condoms are less reliable in
preventing
transmission
of
genital herpes and genital human
papillomavirus (HPV), STDs that
are transmitted by skin-to-skin

contact, because the site of
infection may lie outside the
condom. However, people with
herpes or HPV should still use
condoms to protect against
other STDs.
The male latex condom is
considered to be the most
effective condom in preventing
STDs. The female condom,
which is made of plastic, is also
considered effective for STD
protection. Natural membrane
condoms are not recommended
for STD prevention.

Black History Month can be observed and celebrated by all races
■ BY ZHANDA
JO H NSO N
NEWS EDITOR
Although Black History
month is dedicated to honoring
and studying the history of
African
Americans,
it
is
important to note that Black
History can be learned and
celebrated by all races.
According
to
Darron
Cannon,
SIUE bursar
and
chairman of this year’s Black
History
Committee,
Black
History is just another part of the
educational process.
“The United States is a
melting pot,” Cannon said. “We,

as a people, need to come
together and learn about the
history of all races.”
Cannon said that the lack of
knowledge of black history can
often create problems such
as racism.
Anthony
Cheeseboro,
associate professor of Historical
Studies said anybody can learn
something
from
Black
History Month.
“You need to learn as much
as you can about all people,”
Cheeseboro said.
Recently,
Cheeseboro
participated in SIUE’s Black
History
celebration
by
moderating a panel discussion

entitled
“African-American
History: A Retrospective from
Carter
G.
Woodson
to
the Present.”
There are a lot of ways in
which all races can celebrate and
learn from Black History Month.
Cheeseboro said that one of the
best ways of learning is from
watching television.
“During
Black
History
Month there are specials on TV
on Black History,” he said.
Cheeseboro cited PBS as a
good channel for watchinmg
programs dealing with Black
History.

BUTLER, Ga. (AP) — A
Taylor County Elementary
School teacher has been docked
three days pay for forcing a 6year-old to lick m ilk off a
lunchroom table after she saw
him spitting it on the table.
After the incident occurred
Jan. 15, the teacher was
directed to apologize to the
first-grade student in front of
other students that same day
and later received a three-day
suspension with pay by the
superintendent, which she has
already served.

docking the teacher’s pay.
The teacher was not

Ms. Burgamy was not at the

“s tr u g g le ?

Back in high school, I used to wonder how I could be a good writer, a good black writer
when I’ve never had a struggle. I’d lived a Beaver Cleaver life in the gentle, easy burbs of
St. Louis County.
Every day I watched the same things on TV everyone else watched. 1 saw what was the
packaged and delivered image of what a black person was supposed to be. I never worried
about my “blackness” until I left the “hood” and moved to a predominantly white, upper
D a n ie lle
middle class neighborhood when I was fourteen. I never questioned my blackness when I
B elto n
lived in an all black suburb and attended Keeven Elementary, a 99 percent black school. I
talked about the blacks at my integrated junior high who had been raised around whites. To me, they were
foreign. I was glad that I wasn’t like them, but they surprised me when they told me that I wasn’t
black enough.
Due to the so-called “black experience” that I had growing up in a predominantly black
neighborhood, they had declared that I was not authentic enough. I’d never been in a fight and I’d never
seen a gun. I didn’t speak slang, I was a A student and my neighborhood was a very nice one. Because of
this, all of a sudden, I wasn’t black to them. Then in the blink of an eye, I was one of them, the group
I despised.
Slowly, I began to question my own blackness. I’d compare my life to the lives of other, famous
blacks who write and I’d read about their lives and the adversity they had to overcome to achieve their
goals. I was no Maya Angelou or Toni Morrison. Kevin Powell didn’t come from the “land of the
clueless” which I had suddenly become immersed in. I’d bought into the same media stereotypes the rest
of the world believed in. All my life I wanted to be a writer. It was what I was good at, but who’d ever
heard of a good black writer from the suburbs? All black people were from the “ghetto,” right? That’s
what everyone was acting like and I definitely wasn’t from the ghetto. I doubted my own talent because
I felt like I was a black person with no struggle. I’d never been poor. I’d never gone hungry. I'd never had
to sacrifice anything.
Poor me. My parents just had to go and get a college education and provide for me. They just had to
be upstanding, law-abiding citizens. I had to sound just so “white” when I wrote. Here I was young and
ignorant, envious of others because they possessed the so-called “experience” I lacked. I look back now
and wonder if I was crazy then. I was worried that in the real world I wouldn’t be accepted by other black
writers. Would I be written off by them in the same way that my peers wrote me off? I was falling into
the trap of believing that poverty and pain was some sort of signature of blackness.
It took me a long time to realize that there was no such thing as “to write black.” What was it to walk
and talk black? What was it to write black? Who set those standards for us? Who said that I wasn’t a “real
black writer” if I had no so-called “struggle?” I soon realized that this was how we bound themselves, by
buying into the molds already set and made for us by people who don’t even know us.
Life is nothing but a long struggle. I easily could have given in to peer pressure and performed as the
clown that my peers wanted me to be, but I didn’t. We all have a struggle. Every black person, whether
from Compton, Calif, or Florissant, Mo., has a story to tell. It all depends on whether they have the means
and talent to tell it. I decided to write about my own black experience and let no one judge me on whether
my experience was authentic enough. I know now who I am, I have a story to tell and the with which
to tell it.

Letters to the editor
Assorted editorials
from around the nation
From the p re sid e n t to n o n -vio len ce in a vio len t s o c ie ty
a re the to p ics o f th ese va rio u s letters to the e d ito r
Peninsula Daily News, Port
Angeles, Wash., on nonviolence:
It seems increasingly that the
idea of using nonviolence to
achieve change has fallen by
the wayside.
The methods of men like
Martin Luther King, Jr., and
Mahatma Gandhi simply aren’t
as popular as they once were.
From Bosnia to Saddam to
teenagers killing parents to the
idea that carrying guns makes us
all safer, violence or the threat of
violence is all too often seen as
the answer.
But it doesn’t have to be that
way.. Gandhi and King, for
example, achieved more through
nonviolence than most generals,
dictators or politicians can claim.

in several polls over the past few
days, as the Clinton presidency
seemed to be in deep peril.
The attitude apparent among
many Americans - that Mr.
Clinton is no worse than other
politicians - troubles us. What it
suggests is that the citizens of this
nation have become highly
cynical about all elected officials.
Let us hope that our
collective national attitude is not
nearly as cynical as the polls
might have us believe.
Let us hope that what most
Americans appear to be thinking
merely reflects a current state of
confusion that will eventually be
dispelled as the truth becomes
known in this disturbing episode
in our national history.

Lubbock (Texas) AvalancheJournal, on Clinton’s poll
numbers:
Americans seem confused
and perplexed as to what they
think, or should think, about the
behavior of their president. They
appear to hold certain attitudes
that are actually contradictory.
A majority gives Mr. Clinton
high marks for his performance
in the White House.
A majority believes that he
had an affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky
and then told her to lie when
asked about it.
A majority considers the
president to be just as ethical as
most other politicians.
A majority thinks he should
not resign now because of the
latest allegations involving Ms.
Lewinsky.
A majority believes he
should resign if he lied about the
alleged affair.
A majority blames Mr.
Clinton’s enemies for creating the
latest scandal.
Those,
at
least,
are
Americans’ opinions as reflected

The Lima (Ohio) News, on
President Clinton’s credibility:
Allegations
of
sexual
misconduct and perjury engulfed
the president for a week before he
told the American public that he
did not have a sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
Most Americans believe
Lewinsky’s claims. But many
don’t care even if the Arkansas
Wonder has lied to the public.
Clinton’s
authority
ultimately rests on his word.
When Bill Clinton threatens Iraq
or promises to fix Social Security,
Americans and world leaders are
supposed to believe him. But who
can possibly believe anything this
man says?
The programs the president
promised during last week’s State
of the Union Address won’t cost
much, he says. But what will we
say a few years down the road
when the costs boost the deficit
or eat further into our pay?
By then, we hope, Americans
will have learned that a person even the president - is only as
good as his word.

AMARILLO, Texas (AP) —
Negative media attention on mad
cow disease pales in comparison
to “the bomb” dropped by Oprah
Winfrey when she discussed the
issue in April 1996, says a
Texas cattleman suing the talk
show host.
Paul Engler, chief executive
officer of Cactus Feeders Inc.,
one of the largest cattle feeders in
the world, returned to the stand
today as the civil trial against
Ms. Winfrey, her production
company and vegetarian activist
Howard Lyman plowed into its
fourth week.
Ms. W infrey’s attorney,
Charles Babcock, said other TV
programs had raised questions
about the possibility of mad cow
disease infecting U.S. cattle by
the time Oprah discussed the
subject on April 16, 1996.
But Engler responded, “ ‘The
Oprah Winfrey Show’ was the
bomb that set it all off. The
market was living with the other
information. The market didn’t
drop until her show.”
Lyman’s attorney, Barry
Peterson, suggested that his
client’s statements on the show
were merely opinions.
Engler responded, “Mr.
Lyman’s
entitled
to
any
opinion. If he would have
qualified his statements as
opinions, we probably wouldn’t
be sitting here.”

Babcock showed, however,
that prices had been falling in the
days prior to Ms. Winfrey’s
episode on mad cow. He
suggested that the market was
already in decline because of
drought, poor exports, high milo
and corn prices, other media
attention on mad cow disease, the
North American Free Trade
Agreement and too much supply.
But Engler discounted each
of those factors.
“Our exports were doing
very well until ‘The Oprah
Winfrey Show’, which put fears
in the countries that bought our
cattle,” Engler said.
Engler blamed what he
claimed were “false statements”
on Lyman.
During the show, Lyman
suggested that as long as ground
up cattle parts were being fed
back to herds - known as
ruminant feeding - mad cow
disease was a risk in the United
States and could make AIDS
look like the common cold.
The feeding practice is
now banned.
The cattlemen contend Ms.
Winfrey edited the show to
eliminate pro-beef comments in
favor
of
more
alarming
statements
by
Lyman,
a
former rancher.
During the show, Ms.
Winfrey swore off hamburgers.
The
cattlemen
were
expected to wrap up their case
this week, clearing the way for
Ms. Winfrey and Lyman to begin
calling witnesses.

Eight-year-old boy dies after accidentally

from defamatory remarks.
Babcock attempted to show
that $4 million of the $5.78
million Engler claims to have
lost resulted from trades or
“hedges” the stockman made
on the cattle futures market
May 2, 1996.
By that time, Babcock said,
cattle prices had rebounded to
higher than the date of the mad
cow episode and a cattlemen’s
survey had shown Americans
still had 80 percent confidence
in beef.
Also, Ms. Winfrey had
aired a follow up episode on
April 23, 1996, allowing only
pro-beef comments.
“Yet, you want Ms. Winfrey
to pay for your bad business
decision made on May 2. Is that
right?” Babcock asked.
“Yes, sir. Absolutely,”
Engler responded. “The damage
was done on the initial show.”
He also blamed the talk
show for reduced beef exports
to Japan.
When Babcock told him the
show didn’t air in Japan, Engler
replied, “I didn’t know that, but
many of the Japanese beef buyers
are based in the United States.”
Engler, 68, contended the
price decline after Ms. Winfrey’s
mad cow program forced him to
sell his cattle at a loss.
“I thought the market would
bounce back, but it was obvious
that the impact of Ms. Winfrey’s
show was profound because
cattle prices just kept going
down,” he said.

apparently found a key to his
parents’ locked bedroom door
and removed a .25-caliber
handgun from a closet. The boy
began playing with the gun in the
bathroom when it accidentally
went off.
Christopher’s 13-year-old
brother heard the shot, found the
boy lying on the bathroom floor
and called 911, police said.
Sgt. Laura-Lu Herman, a

E v e n in g s J S t W

state police spokeswoman, said
the incident is being investigated.
Herman said Maryland law
requires that a loaded firearm
may not be stored or left in any
location where the individual
knew or should have known that
an unsupervised minor anyone
under the age of 16 could get it.
It was not immediately
known if the gun was loaded or if
the boy loaded it, police said.

Police Incidents

from page 1

Dr. Sharon Hahs, acting
provost and vice-chancellor for
academic affairs, said that this
increase is very favorable to all,
as the school is able to grow in
all aspects without sacrificing
quality
academ ics
and
programming.
The enrollment increase is
p roof that SIUE is being
recognized
as
a
quality
institution, according to Dr.

Narbeth
Emmanuel,
vicechancellor for student affairs.
“SIUE is gaining a greater
visibility at both a state and
national level,” Emmanuel
said. “This is a very exciting
time for SIUE. We are growing
and this is an institution where
students
can
receive
an
affordable education and a
quality learning experience.”

HISTORY

Stolen Vehicle
On 2/5/98 at 2:59 a.m. police received confirmation on a vehicle that had been stolen from a Cougar
Village parking lot and had been recovered by the Madison Police Department. The vehicle belongs to
a student. Police are continuing their investigation.
Theft Under
On 2/4/98 at 3:12 p.m. a student reported someone stole her purse while she was in the cafeteria area of

from page 1

SIUE also has events
geared toward everyone during
Black History Month.
On Feb. 20 there will be a
C areer Awareness F air in
which
students,
ranging
from
m iddle
school
to
community colleges from the
m etro-east
counties,
are
encouraged to attend.
Cannon said at first he

thought of having this career
fair because it is something
that minorities do not normally
attend. However, he decided to
invite students from over 150
schools
from
different
backgrounds and races. There
are also a variety o f other
Black History M onth events
happening at SIUE in which
everyone is invited to attend.

Theft Over
On 2/5/98 at 2:30 p.m. an employee of the eye clinic at the East St. Louis Center reported someone stole
three pair of Fendi sunglasses from the sunglass case in the clinic. The sunglasses are value at $600.
Police are continuing their investigation.
Arrest
On 2/6/98 at 12:51 a.m. police arrested Michael Havenar, age 19, of Edwardsville for unlawful
possession of cannabis and unlawful possession of drug equipment. Havenar was issued a notice to
appear and was released.

Like a ska band.

“I just read the new ‘Rolling Stone’ and it said
‘straight up ska punk, Smashmouth,”’ said bass
player Paul De Lisle. “We kind of cringe at that
label, and I’m sure hardcore ska people hate it too,
because we’re not a ska band.”
De Lisle said the band likes to think of itself as a
rock and roll band, even though they might have
elements of ska in a few of their songs. They’re not
crazy about labels, especially when the label is ‘ska.’
Ska, these days, is not very clearly defined.
“It’s all over the place,” De Lisle said. “What’s
next, like ska country? Ska metal?”
Smashmouth is just starting a new tour, appearing
with Third Eye Blind to support their release from
last year, “Fush Yu Mang.” They had a big hit last
year with the single “Walkin’ On The Sun.” While
the single was climbing up the charts, they were
touring with Sugar Ray who also had a big single.
“We both had songs on the chart,” De Lisle said.
“And we would joke about the charts and say like,

But things go sour for Sandler when he is left at
the altar. He can’t continue his job as the wedding
singer, because he now hates weddings.
He somehow gets talked into helping plan the
wedding of Drew Barrymore and the two start to
fall in love. Essentially, the plot is not a new one,
it’s standard love story fare, but Sandler and
Barrymore bring a certain charm to it. Sandler
loses most of his moronic patter, but makes up for
it with sincerity.

Women’s hoops hoping for wins to stay 3rd in GLVC
■ BY JASO N TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
The
Cougar
women’s
basketball team has four more
games starting with Indiana
University-Purdue University at
Ft. Wayne tonight and then St.
Joseph’s College on Saturday to
end their regular season.
The women are rounding out
their season after taking out five
of their last seven conference foes
behind the play of freshman Misi
Clark, junior Kim Lowe and

freshman Erica Cory.
Cougar women’s basketball is
sitting on third place in the Great
Lakes Valley Conference. If SIUE
wants to maintain their position
they will have to keep playing the
type of ball they have been
playing lately.
“Our goal is to win out the rest
of the way,” head coach Wendy
Hedberg said. “We are sitting
where we want to be right now,
but we have two tough road
games this weekend that will
really challenge us.”

At 16-6 overall and 11-3 in
conference play, the Cougars
have been forced to play with
their whole squad due to injuries
lately. With Leslie Phillips and
Chris Loomis recently coming off
ankle injuries, Hedberg had to
resort to the ranks and employ
some help from the bench. Junior
forward April Clendenin and
freshman center Crystal Gladson
came in and filled the spots they
may be taking when the two
seniors finish their final season.
A few SIUE players have

reached or are close to reaching
goals in their careers.
Senior forward Alicia Harkins
has breezed by the 1,000 point
marker with 1,122 points which
puts her at eighth on the all-time
scoring list.
Lowe, a forward from
Hamilton, 111. has grabbed 239
rebounds this season to total 540
rebounds for her career. With one
year left, Lowe seems to be
tracking the 754 rebound record
set by the Cougar’s all-time
rebound leader Kathy Going who

played from 1975-79.
To go along with the veteran
performances, Clark, a guard
from Paris, 111. has 404 points this
season. Her 18.4 points per game
has Clark as a shoo-in to break the
all-time freshman scoring mark at
485 points that was set by former
All-American LeAnn Bryan in
the 1991-92 season.
After the Cougars’ two-game
road trip, they will return home
on Feb. 19th to face Quincy
University.

Men’s b-ball looking for streak over weekend to extend season
■ BY BR ETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Four more games will determine if the SIUE men’s
basketball team will extend its season into the Great Lakes
Valley Conference tournament in two weeks.
These teams aren’t the toughest that the Cougars have
faced this season, but these are four important games for
a team that has lost six of their last eight games.
The Cougars are currently tied with Indianapolis for
sixth place in the conference standings. SIUE has an
overall record of 13-8 and a 7-7 GLVC mark. The top
seven teams advance to the conference tournament which
begins on Feb. 24.
SIUE should have the edge in the final two weeks of
the season as none of their remaining regular season
opponents have a record over .500 in conference play.
This weekend, SIUE will pack their bags for a trip to

Indiana to face Indiana University-Purdue Univeristy at
Ft. Wayne today and Saint Joseph’s College on Saturday.
Back on Dec. 4, the Cougars downed Saint Joseph’s
75-69 thanks to 14 points from Lebanon native Allen
Berry. Two days later, IUPU-Ft. Wayne met the same fate
as senior Tim Holloway contributed a team-high 18 points
in an 85-73 SIUE victory. Travis Wallbaum, of Mt.
Vernon, led the Cougars on the glass ripping down a total
of 23 rebounds in the two games.
Head coach Jack Margenthaler thinks that both IUPUFt. Wayne and Saint Joseph’s have changed since he
played them last, but he’s looking to concentrate on what
his team needs to do to win rather than trying to figure out
his opposition.
With a season-high 30 points last game, Kreke leads
the Cougars with a 13.9 points per game average. He is
also second on the team in rebounding with an average of
seven per contest.

Kreke is poised to be only the second player in school
history to score 1,000 points and grab 500 rebounds in his
SIUE career. He currently has 960 points and 522
rebounds. The only other player to reach the feat was Bill
Branz (1976-80) when he had 1,057 points and 1,057
boards in his career at SIUE.
The steady play of Rusty Sames has him second in
team scoring with 12 points per game. Sames also leads
the team from behind the arc sinking a team-high 37
three-pointers.
Wallbaum has been a pleasant surprise for
Margenthaler in his second year with the team. He leads
the Cougars with 179 boards on the year and ranks second
in the GLVC in rebounding.
“He (Wallbaum) is playing very consistent,”
Margenthaler said. “I really believe he’s doing as much as
we can ask of him as a sophomore.”

Addition of football team at SIUE
possibility in distant future
■ BY SA R A H FINLEY
SPORTS EDITOR
SIUE has 14 Division II sports
teams, competes in the Great
Lakes Valley Conference, has
won 16 NCAA Championships,
holds three conference titles and
does not have a football team.
To some this may seem odd,
but to SIUE it has been this
way since the doors were opened
in 1957.
When the school first opened,
there was no discussion of a
football team and now, 41 years
later, there still is no discussion.
According to SIUE athletic
director Cindy Jones, football
would throw off the balance
between men’s and women’s
sports on campus.
“We would have to expand
women’s sports to balance out the
football program,” Jones said. “It
would take the addition of two
women’s sports to equal football
in expenditure.”
This is due to a piece of
legislation called Title IX that
was passed in 1975. This law
prohibits sex discrimination in
sports in schools.

Along with the problem of
gender equality, this school
would not be able to produce the
large amounts of money it would
take to pull off the program.
The average expenditure for a
Division II football team in 1996,
according
to
Jones,
was
$369,000. SIUE would have to
expend anywhere from that
amount to $400,000 for a team
and that would not include the
one-time start up fee of $200,000.
SIUE would have to dish out
not only $600,000 in funds to
start the team, they would also
have to provide facilities for the
large number of players. Bob
Guelker Field is the only facility
that could even start to provide a
home for the team.
“We don’t have a locker room
big enough to hold all of the
players,” Jones said.
With any sports program,
there is the hope of gaining
revenue to pay for the facilities.
Football, at least Division II
football, is not a smart
investment.
In 1996, 85 percent of 73
Division II schools ended their
year in the red reporting a yearend deficit of $134,000. The

other 16 percent reported a gross
profit of only $65,000. With an
average profit of only 18 percent
of the total expense, a football
team
would
not
be
an
economically smart idea.
“Football is not a money­
making proposition,” Jones said.
“It is just not economically
feasible.”
Jones said that football is not a
guaranteed crowd pleaser.
“Student attendance at events
isn’t very good as it is,” she said.
“There is also competition from
the Rams. Years ago, there was
no competition.”
For now, football is on the
back burner for SIUE. But, Jones
said that it is not at all an
impossibility.
“The Intercollegiate Athletics
Committee recognizes that at
some point in SIUE’s future,
football might be a good
decision,” Jones said. “However,
under the current economic
constraints and the IB HE (Illinois
Board of Higher Education)
mandates regarding the use of
university funds to support
athletics, the benefits simply do
not justify the expense.”

Steelers offensive
coordinator front man for
Cowboys head coach
PITTSBURGH
(AP) —
Pittsburgh Steelers offensive
coordinator Chan Gailey is
emerging as a front-runner in the
search for a successor to Barry
Switzer as the Dallas Cowboys’
head coach.
Gailey flew to Dallas on
Monday after meeting with
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for
the third time in two days at the
NFL scouting combine in
Indianapolis.
Jones has said he wants the
new coach to serve also as
the offensive coordinator and
call the plays, which Gailey
has done under Steelers coach

Bill Cowher.
Gailey also has experience
serving as head coach for
Birmingham in the World
League and Troy State at the
collegiate level.
“I think I’m closer to a
decision than when I came
here,” Jones said Monday. “But
I don’t have any timetable for
making a decision.”
If Gailey were hired, the
Steelers would suffer, since
Gailey
also
serves
as
quarterback coach. To interview
NFL coaches, the Steelers would
have to receive permission from
their teams.

Caldwell, 22, was arrested
early Sunday and charged with
DWI and careless driving. Police
said his blood-alcohol content
was 0.13 percent.
DeBriyn
said
Caldwell
violated team rules, and could
face further discipline.
Caldwell led the Razorbacks
in RBI last year, with 41, while
amassing a .353 batting average.
