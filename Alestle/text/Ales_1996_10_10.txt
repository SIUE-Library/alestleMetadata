Three charged in theft of sorority funds
By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor and
Darryl Howlett
News Editor
O ne count of felony charges of theft has been lodged against the form er
president of Alphi Phi and two other individuals after the three allegedly stole
$5,900 from the sorority.
Scott Evers, detective with the Edwardsville Police D epartm ent, said an
investigation begun last year has culm inated in the arrest of Christie Schneider,
22, her father, 49-year-old Paul Schneider and 22-year-old Dennis Butkovich.
According to Evers, Schneider was president of the sorority in 1995 when the
treasurer was unable to continue her duties. In accordance with sorority rules,
Schneider took over the task. A round Jane, Schneider told other m embers that
“some guy” was going to buy a house that they could then rent-to-own.
“T hat guy” was S chneider’s father, Paul, who had form ed A m erican
Investm ent Trust. The house he was going to buy was located on R oute 159 next
to Sigma Phi Epsilon’s fraternity house.
Evers said the trust put $2,000 down in earnest money and a sales contract
was signed with the stipulation that repairs could be made to the house at no cost
to the current owners.

“Dennis Butkovich, C hristie’s boyfriend, went to (the now closed) First of
A m erica M ortgage company. H e applied for a loan in his name, but the deal fell
apart and the realtor began to get suspicious. M eantime, the sorority members
had begun to move in and fix it up.”
By October, the sorority had discovered they didn’t own the house and never
would. T hat’s when Evers began to investigate the Schneiders and Butkovich.
The investigation revealed that Schneider had taken $5,100 out of a house bond
account and another $800 from a savings account.
An administrative source who asked not to be identified, said it was likely
their accounts were off-campus, because otherwise a financial officer would have
had to sign off on the accounts as well.
“Christie adm itted taking the money and putting it into the house, but
claimed she had permission from the national chapter and other sorority
members,” Evers said. “The trust took all the money and tried to do what
am ounts to an illegal transaction.”
If the scam had worked, Evers said, the Trust would have bought the house
with the sorority’s money and then could have charged them rent to live in a
house they thought they owned.
The investigation is continuing, Evers said, because of all the paperw ork that
was misfiled in the course of setting up the Trust and “buying” the house.

Appeals court upholds conviction

Elderly abuse law being pushed in Springfield

A P — H e claimed he was shooting
at an evil mist hovering above the W hite H ouse, but that explanation
didn’t change a conviction for attempting to assassinate President
Clinton two years ago.
Francisco Martin Duran was sentenced to 40 years in prison last
year for firing two dozen bullets into the W hite H ouse Oct. 29,1994.
N o one was injured in the shooting.
Duran, an upholsterer from Colorado Springs, Colo, claimed that
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey erred by not allowing him to
present an insanity defense in a separate trial.

Medical study cites yellow fever cases on rise
A P — M edical officials are alarmed at what seem s to be an increase
in yellow fever cases in sub-Saharan Africa. They are appealing for
$190 million to control the disease.
The Journal of the Am erican M edical Association found 18,735
yellow fever cases worldwide — including 4,522 deaths — from 1987
to 1991. The study stated it was the highest incidence o f the disease
since 1948. Yellow fever has not been reported in North America
since 1905, but the yellow fever m osquito recently made its way to the
southeastern U nited States.

A P — A proposal being pushed by Illinois Attorney General
Jim Ryan would require caregivers to report abuse of the
elderly and disabled. His plan would create two new crimes:
criminal abuse o f a vulnerable adult and criminal neglect of a
vulnerable adult. Prison sentences for violators would range
from one to three years, to four to 15 years, depending on the
degree o f harm to the victim. Illinois is only one of eight
states without such a broad reporting law.

Man wins appeal after 16 years’ wrongful imprisonment
BELLEV ILLE N E W S-D E M O C R A T — Lee Otis Griffin,
38, walked out o f a federal courthouse Tuesday without the
shackles h e’d worn going in. A lm ost sixteen years ago, he
left his m other’s house to buy milk and was arrested for
shooting three people to death.
H e has always insisted he only witnessed the murders and
passed a polygraph test seven years ago. Griffin will remain
free while the state attempts a final appeal to the U.S.

Letter to the editor

What decade are we living in?
I am writing this letter concerning the article
in T hursday’s issue about A pril Smith. A fter
reading it, I had to stop and ask what decade
we are living in. Com e on people, we are all
the same. W hen are the sick people of the
world going to see that the color of o n e’s skin
does not determ ine who you are as a person.
Wake up. This was a vulnerable wom an
walking toward and standing N E A R a bus stop
at 10 at night. W hat was that bus driver
thinking? We, as students, are paying for this
bus system (I’m sure) and w hen a wom an
needs a ride hom e from work, she is denied
because she was not AT the bus stop (I bet that
was the real problem , Mr. Bus Driver!). This is
what our money goes towards. Racist bus
drivers who w on’t give a wom an a ride hom e?
A N D what about those police officers, (if you
want to call them that)? I was under the
impression that police officers are in our towns
to serve and protect. W hat about that woman
who needed to be protected? How can a police
officer tell a wom an to find a ride hom e at 10
at night when they know darn well that she is
stranded at that bus stop.
Again, we are forking over money, this time

for- SIU E police officers, and they were no
good to April. We pay SIU E to have police
officers to protect us and serve us and when we
need them most, they are sitting back with
their feet up. We pay for city police and they
were no good as well. W ho are we to count
on? I used to trust and feel safe about police
officers, but now I w onder if that ever
happened to me, could I count on the police to
help me out. It IS their job.
This is not the first incident with the MCT
bus system that I have heard of. I do not ride
the bus, and I’m glad that I don't if this is what
I would have to put up with. I have friends that
do ride this system and have heard many
stories like this one. I can’t believe that
students are putting up with this kind of
treatm ent. G ranted, anything we voice has no
say on decisions that are m ade at this campus,
but we need to speak out m ore, like A nthony
Smith has done. M aybe the right person will
be listening, someday, and som ething will be
done to keep students rights and keep us safe,
like we were promised.

Letter to the editor

Help cut Dick Durbin's puppet strings
In the A m erican Legion m agazine Rep. Toby R oth writes, “For most of our nation’s history,
English has been the glue that has held our people together” . T h at’s changing, however, as
written and oral drivers’ license tests in foreign languages are available in 40 states, including
Illinois. California provides the exam in 31 languages.
R oth also states that, “In many places in Am erica, English is no longer the first language in
school. With governm ent funds, our children are now taught in dozens of languages...12
different languages in New York City alone. Instead of a first-rate education in English,
students are taught in their native tongue, and English is rarely spoken!”
To correct this lunacy, Congress recently voted to m ake English our Official Language
(HR-123), which m eans that the prim ary language in school is English and that you vote and
deal with the governm ent in English. People will still be encouraged to speak and learn foreign
languages and preserve their heritage; the significant difference being that the governm ent
reinforces our com m on language (English) rather than erodes it.
Come N ovem ber I ’ll be voting for U.S. senatorial candidate A1 Salvi, since his liberal,
cohesively im paired opponent, R ichard D. D urbin voted against the com m on sense Official
Language legislation.
The self-described fiscal conservative (imagine that), D urbin, should explain why he voted
NO on HR-123 when the A m erican Legislative Exchange Council estim ates bilingual
education costs an additional $8 billion a year, with Illinois spending $54 million of that!
It should be clear why the National Taxpayers U nion rates D urbin as the 3rd worst tax and
spender!
O n his own, R ichard D urbin has shown himself incapable of severing the ties (strings)
betw een himself and the National E ducation A ssociation’s ultra-liberal agenda.
By all m eans d o n ’t miss your opportunity on Nov. 5 to help cut D urbin’s num erous and
firmly attached puppet strings!

letter to the editor

True socialism did not die with the Soviet Union
In this election season, our political leaders have
once again failed to give the A m erican people a true
choice. I am not talking about Bill Clinton and Bob
D ole, although I could be (but th at’s a topic for
ano th er editorial). No, instead I am referring to the
lack of econom ic leadership and vision our political
leaders have given us. Everyday one hears that
socialism is dead and that capitalism is hum anity’s
only hope. Well, we are not that bad off yet. The
claim is th at socialism died with the Soviet Union. I
am here to dispute that claim. Socialism, true
socialism, is not dead. It is alive and well and it is
called dem ocratic socialism.
W hat is dem ocratic socialism? This is the most
com m on q u estio n I am ever asked. A ny
organization that calls itself “socialist” is bound to
suffer from the lack of a concrete definition of what
it m eans to be socialist. A fter all, the Com m unists of
the Soviet U nion, China and C uba have all claimed
to socialists as well as the L abour Party of G reat
B ritain and the Social D em ocrats of Sweden. H itler’s
party in Nazi G erm any was nam ed the National
Socialists.
So ju st w hat is a socialist? R ealizing the
problem atic nature of the venture, I wish to m ake a
specific claim to the term . First of all, I (and m ost of
the w estern socialist world) define “socialism” as a
separate entity from “com m unism ”. They are not
the sam e thing.
Com m unism is the form of governm ent that has
existed in ea ste rn E u ro p e , C hina, C uba and
Vietnam . It is authoritarian and advocates a violent
overthrow of the capitalist system. T he com m unist
governm ent is run through the dictatorial rule of the
“vanguard” party and elim inates all opposition to
itself.
Socialism, on the o ther hand, is dem ocratic. It
seeks to bring about socialism through peaceful,

parliam entary means. It defends the rights of all
opposition groups and seeks to win the m andate of
socialism through peaceful persuasion and election.
It has parties all over the dem ocratic world. The
U nited States is the only advanced nation w ithout a
m ajor socialist party.
D em ocratic socialists and the D SA , as an
organization, have a long, proud history of opposing
communism. We believe that all people have the
right to a truly dem ocratic government. Now, does
this m ean that we believe differently from all people
who call themselves “com m unists”? No. T here are
many people throughout the world and this land
who call them selves communists who believe just as
we do. They are com m itted dem ocrats and socialists.
The confusion started with Marx.
M arx thought that capitalism would eventually
solve the problem s of scarcity in the m odern
economy. Yet, it would do this by exploiting workers.
Eventually, the workers would get sick of being poor,
w hen they could be rich, and would institute
“socialism”. Socialism, as term ed by Marx, was the
transitional stage that would follow the fall of
capitalism. A fter the bugs were w orked out in
socialism, society would enter a new era of utopia
called “com m unism ”. Now comes the confusion.
Everything was fine until Lenin, Stalin and a few
others decided that they would start their own
M arxist state and they called them selves
“com m unists”. The brutal, authoritarian nature of
this new regime caused a split within the world wide
socialist m ovem ent.k Those who supported the
Soviets were eventually called C om m unists and
those who opposed them were called Socialists.
Mind you, there are many who disagree with this
arrangem ent, but it is the m ost widely used.
Thus, we can track the differences betw een the
various “isms” in the following way: We will rank
them on a scale from high (H ) to low (L).

m ust check at the door when you en ter the m odern
workplace. A m erica’s dem ocratic system does not
work as well as it should because it is perverted daily
by the hierarchical and authoritarian nature of the
capitalist economy. We simply cannot function as a
dem ocracy if our m ajor institutions, o u r families, our
churches, o u r schools, and yes, our workplaces,
operate in a m anner that contradicts those very
values of democracy.
Only socialism has the vision to com plete the
historic mission of the dem ocratic em ancipation of
the com m on m an and woman. The true goal of
socialism is freedom . F reedom from economic
aristocracy. I do not believe that scarcity must always
rule. W orking together, we can fulfill the historic
m arch of hum an em ancipation, for the drum beat of
freedom has brought us to this point and its faithful
rhythm leads the way.

Vanzo addresses appeals
process with student government
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
Parking tickets and students do not mix. In the past couple
of years students have com plained about an apparent rise in
the num ber of tickets issued to students.
A t the student senate m eeting last Friday, Bob Vanzo,
d irec to r of adm inistrative services, addressed student
senator’s questions about parking tickets, specifically, why
students have to pay for parking tickets before an appeal
hearing is held.
“The reason for the paym ent up front is because of the
num ber of frivolous appeals,” Vanzo said. “I do n ’t think that
appeals such as, ‘my car was parked only two or three hours
over the limit,’ was fair to the people who have to process
them..”
In prior years, students were able to file an appeal with the
university before they had to pay their fine. Vanzo said the
change came due to the num ber of appeals causing a backup
for personnel who process the appeals.
S tu d en t sen ato r R andy H obson q u estio n ed the
adm inistration’s com m unications skills with students.
“Mr. Vanzo, I ’m asking how you can have a better
understanding betw een students and the community, because
right now you guys (parking services) are mud,” Hobson
said.
“We need to get stu dents on p arking and traffic
committees. Last year only one student came to one meeting.
It’s up to student senate to provide students to sit in on the
meetings,” Vanzo said.
Vanzo went on to say that this year they have sent the
package for the meetings to students who will be involved
with
th e
traffic
and
p arking
com m ittee.
A udrey Smith, chairperson of the Personnel and Public
R elations Com m ittee said that students on the traffic and
parking com m ittee will be in attendance this year.
“Students can cause them selves less problem s if they read
the parking rules and regulations that are provided when
they pay for their parking stickers,” Vanzo said.
Vanzo said any suggestions on improving traffic and
p ark in g regulations from th e stu d en t body would be
appreciated.

intends to help her mentee. But there is a slight problem.
“H e w on’t answer the phone,” she said, “I keep getting his
m achine.”
A lthough problem s like this exist, C allender can get
reassigned if her m entee shows no interest in the program. But
it’s good for freshm en to know that they are not alone,
according to the mentors.
Janet M cR eynolds will be in co rp o ratin g the m en to r
program with her freshm an “First Year Experience.”
“We are just trying to pull it all together,” said Hobson, “so
all of the new students will have som eone to help them with
their first year.”
Dr. E m m anuel said he would keep his com m ents short so
students could get to the cookies and punch, which he said was
the m entors’ only reward.
H e shared a story about his days in school.
“I was ready to give up, but I had a m entor that gave me
energy and a spark to persist,” Em m anuel said, continuing, “I
value this experience of m entorship—people coming together
and connecting w ith one a n o th er as a source of
encouragem ent and support.”
F uture meetings include one in two weeks on Oct. 24 at 3
p.m.. T here will be an executive council m eeting to discuss the
hew format. In addition, there will be a general assembly with
■the m entors at 3:30 p.m.
Students can receive credit hours through the Leadership
D evelopm ent Program for their involvem ent in the m entoring
program.
If any stu d en t is in terested in joining the m entoring
program they can contact R andy H obson in Kimmel

Forum to define m orality
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
S tu d en ts seeking guidance, thought
provoking conversation or a change of pace
can attend a free “M orality Forum ” at noon
on Oct. 10th. Sponsored by the Philosophy
Society and d ep a rtm en t o f philosophical
studies, the forum will be in the G oshen
Lounge of the University Center.
M ike
S chaefer, P resid en t
of the
Philosophy Society, said, “I want students to
take seriously the issue of morality. It’s not
som ething that can be confined to certain
times and activities.”
Schaefer m entioned that the event was
scheduled during the noon hour on purpose.
H e hopes stu dents will fill the G oshen
Lounge and take part in discussing morality
with the guest speakers.
Em m et McAuliffe of KJSL Radio, Bill
Ramsey of the W orld Com m unity C enter,
Bhim D asa of the International Society for

Krishna Consciousness, and Allyson Heil of
the H ope Clinic for Women are the speakers
that Schaefer scheduled to attend.
Every speaker will be required to answer
the following two questions: “W hat is the
basis for m orality?” , and “W hat does it take
to be m oral?”
A fte r the speakers answ er the two
questions, S chaefer hopes students will
interact with them. H e also m entioned a
second m eeting that will be held Nov. 18th.
T he topic will be “O ne N ation: M any
M oralities.”
“The main interest (of the Philosophy
Society),” according to Schaefer, “is to show
people that philosophy is useful outside of
the classroom. It is som ething people can
guide their lives by.”
Students interested in the topic of ethics
are encouraged to enroll in Philosophy 320,
which covers the theories o f virtue,
obligation, and value.

Bail has been set at $30,000 for the Schneiders and Butkovich, who at the time the A lestle

questions pertaining to the case to D etective Evers.
G reek Council Advisor C onnan Cam pbell, who advises all fraternities and sororities on
campus, gave his com m ents on the case.
“It’s a confidential m atter that the sorority has been handling for quite some time,” Campbell
said.
W hen asked about how this incident would affect relationships with other G reeks on campus,
Cam pbell said, “T here w on’t be any action n or additional inform ation distributed through G reek
Council and its m em bers.”
Randy Rock, vice-chancellor of student affairs, said there would not be any discipline action
taken against Christie Schneider.
“I t’s being handled as a civil m atter. It did not involve university funds or student fee dollars
and the sorority does not have an officially recognized house,” he said.
Rachel Kuhn, president of the SIU E A lpha Phi chapter, declined to com m ent on the incident
involving the house and Schneider.

A long time ago
in a galaxy far, far
away...they were
swingin’!
But
seriously, as a child
(and even now, of
course), I loved
the “Star Wars”
trilogy. I couldn’t
get enough of it. It
was only recently,
though, that I
discovered,
through
careful
analysis,
some
strange overtones
in these films.
Who knows what was going through George
Lucas’ mind when he added some of these
tidbits. Perhaps I’m just looking a little too
deeply into these matters, but there are some
unexplained sexual overtones going on. I’m
talking about stuff that would even make
Caligula wince.
The most noticeable thing would be the light

'S tar W a rs '?

saber, the phallic weapon of choice for Jedi
masters. In that case, though, size apparently
doesn’t matter, just the power behind the
wielder. Luckily for Luke, Ben Kenobi was
there to show him how to use his saber properly.
Also, there weren’t too many Jedis around, so
Luke was probably a popular guy.
Speaking of Luke, did anyone else notice
something incestual relating to “Star Wars” and
“Return of the Jedi.” In the first film, to make
Han Solo jealous, Princess Leia lays a big deep
tongue kiss on Jedi-in-training Skywalker. Well,
in “Return of the Jedi,” it is revealed that the
two are siblings. Yoink! It makes you wonder
what Lucas was thinking, since both stories were
already written when “Star Wars” was filmed.
Next is that wacky lovable duo, C-3PO and R2D2. What kind of sexual antics could these two
be involved in? Well, these longtime
companions might be closer than Mr. Lucas is
letting on. C-3PO is neat, thin and has great
fashion sense. Gold was hot in the galaxy.
Notice, there weren’t too many female droids
hanging around either. He pretends to be
annoyed with Artoo’s antics, but deep down, he

"Middle man7 speaks out
There is a certain passage in
the Bible that goes “Blessed are
the peacemakers, for they shall
be called children of God.”
Maintaining the peace is a
difficult act to accomplish
/ sometimes.
Better yet, it should be referred
to as being caught in the middle.
Being in the middle of any given
situation can cause serious
stress. Whether it is being in the
middle of an argument, dispute
or
conflicting
ideologies,
peacemakers are sometimes
those who get hurt the most.
One situation that people are
familiar with is being the middle
child. You’re not quite the
oldest, but you’re not the baby
either.
With being the oldest sibling,
everything is a first-time event.
The oldest sibling is the role
model
for
all
children
afterwards. In contrast, the
youngest child has all the
luxuries of not repeating the
mistakes of the previous
siblings. Also, if the youngest
does make mistakes, they are
more likely to get away with
them.
So, where do you stand? I have
asked myself this question a
thousand times in the last couple
of weeks. And then to look at a
calender, I’m reminded once
again it’s mid-October right
smack dab in the middle of a
long semester. (I am the middle
sibling in my family)
Being in the middle can have
its ups and downs. Say for
instance you’re single and had a
relatively good relationship with
a friend or group of friends.
However, once your friends "find
out about who you are going
with they don’t talk to you
anymore or acknowledge your

can’t live without the little beeping fella. These
two mechanical robots are definitely the
original odd couple, but apparently, opposite
droids do attract.
A love triangle was created when R2-D2’s
attention turned towards his master Luke
Skywalker. Artoo was always risking his neck
for Luke, and it was obvious.
C-3PO knew it. With jumping out of the closet
being so popular these days, wouldn’t an R2D2/C-3PO sitcom be a huge hit? Throw in a
couple more droids, and there’s a space-age
“Seinfeld.”
Spending all that time avoiding bounty hunters
would make anyone crazy, but it would seem
that Chewbacca was more than just man’s best
friend for Han Solo. Why else would he get so
jealous of Princess Leia? Why didn’t Lucas put
more women into the saga? Leia seemed to be
the only one around, and she was butt-kicking
royalty!
Okay, okay, I’m looking too deeply into this. Of
course, I didn’t even get started on the Jabba the
Hutt/Princess Leia bondage fantasies.
May the force be with you.

Tear Garden is no piece of Cake
By Greg Levrault
For the A lestle
Tear Garden
“ To be an angel blind, the crippled
soul divide”

M o n ie in th e M id d le

B y D a r r y l H o w le tt

presence. So to some, when you
take on a relationship you take
on their enemies also—no
matter how close you were.
Another example would be
when you’re in the middle of a
controversial issue and the
opposing side wants you to go
their way. However, you respect
both, but you know to choose
either
side
would
be
detrimental. So you end up
“treading water” and hoping
whatever problem it is will blow
over.
Sorry, but just like swimming,
treading water only lasts for so
long.
Treading water represents the
familiar
childhood
game
“Monkey in the middle.”As the
children on the opposite ends
throw the ball or object to one
another, the person in the
middle will never get the ball
This is also true in real life: The
person in the middle sometimes
never finds a solution.
Only through truth, honesty,
and respect, can we appreciate
those caught in the middle of
any situation. So the next time
you know of someone “in the
middle” just remember they are
keeping the peace and being a
child of God in the process.

As a rock band, the Tear Garden
plays the type of pretentious, soulless,
metaphorical
fluffer-nutter that
made me want to beat up my Alan
Parsons-loving former roommate.
“To be an angel blind, the crippled
soul divide” is perfect for the type of

person who will talk openly about
obscure German poets of the 19th
century, even if they couldn’t ask
which way it was to the bathroom at
the Germany pavilion at Epcot
Center.
Tear Garden takes a patch of Pink
Floyd, a riff of Rush, a hook of
Hawkwind, and the entire John Tesh
musical library, and produces thirteen
songs that sound less like the band
played music and more like they
dragged their instruments through
the sand. Porn movie soundtracks are
more creative than this.
Certain to still the heart and cloud
the mind, Tear Garden’s latest (and
probably only) album is a
recommended party killer.
Cake
“ Fashion N ugget”
Cake had some critical buzz last
year, with their debut album and their
radio-friendly anarchy anthem “Rock
and Roll Lifestyle.”
It’s a new year, a new album, and
Cake is more deserving of accolades
than ever. In fact, they’re helping
cement a new type of rock ‘n’ roll:
Thrift Shop Rock.

Wing tips and combat fatigues,
suspenders and iron-on tees: thrift
shop chic treats fashion like toppings
on a hamburger.
Similarly, thrift shop rock ransacks
the musical library of the universe,
remixing the bits and pieces in new,
unrecognizable forms that still
manage to rock. Beck is the current
leader of the crusade, creating music
and lyrics that sound like ransom
notes.
Cake also makes exotic musical milk
shakes. “ Fashion N ugget” sounds like
Cake calculated the least number of
instruments necessary to create a
song. These spare, strange songs
range from the honkytonk howlings
of “She’ll Come Back to Me” and
“Stickshifts and Safetybelts,” to
fatback beats and blaring horns in the
Gloria Gaynor cover, “I Will
Survive,” and “Nugget.” There’s even
some Borscht Belt schmaltz, in the
form of a dead-on Peggy Lee cover
(“Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps”).
The country tunes sound like
country, the lounge tunes sound like
lounge music, and the funky rock
tunes sound like funky rock; they’re
all part of the ingredients for real
good Cake.
The album’s best track is also the
first single. It’s a radio darling all over
St. Louis, and it’s sure to be
inescapable in about a week.
The video for “The Distance” has
the latest annoying video trend of
throwing in people dressed in crappy
animal costumes for no apparent
reason. Right now, that’s the only
non-creative thing associated with
Cake, and a nice chew of an album,
“ Fashion N u gget.” If you like
surprises, check this album out.

Cougar soccer jumps to third in nation
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor

File Photo/Alestle

Women's soccer move up the NCAA-II ladder to No. 3 in the nation; Up from No. 8

The SIU E w om en’s soccer team ’s
No. 3 national ranking is the highest
in the
14 year history of
the
program .
The Cougars are 9-0-2 after com ­
peting in the Cougar Classic this
past weekend. A victory over previ­
ously 4th-ranked Truman St. 4-2 and
a 1-1 tie with D rury College p ro ­
pelled SIU E into the No. 3 spot in
the latest U m bro/N ational Soccer
C oaches A ssociation D ivision II
poll. The poll also deem ed SIU E the
No. 1 team in the region.
St. Louis native Janece Friederich
led the Cougars in the tournam ent
and was nam ed the top offensive
perform er in the Classic.
F riederich lead s th e C ougars
with 18 goals and 6 assists for 42
points. She is currently second in the
G reat Lakes Valley C onference in
scoring. H er 18 goals is the second
m ost in SIU E history behind Kelly

Men move up to 19th rank
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
Victories d o n ’t come easy for the SIU E
m en’s soccer team w hen they are away from
B ob G uelker Field.
The Cougars have jum ped back into the
national rankings as the No. 19 team thanks to
a thrilling win over D rury 3-2 on Friday, but
they still have som e work to do.
“We still have to prove we can win on the
road,” head coach Ed H uneke said.
S IU E has not lost at G uelker Field this sea­
son, but three losses on the road show that they
d o n ’t have the sam e winning attitude away
from home.
The Cougars will have a chance to prove
th at they can win on the road as they will play
five of th eir last eight gam es on their

opponent’s soil.
“We’ll be a m ore justified contender for the
playoffs if we show we can win on the road,”
said Huneke.
S IU E is also ranked 5th in the region
according to the latest U m bro/N ational Soccer
Coaches Association Division II poll.
H uneke would like to see his team win at
least four of the next five games and host the
GLVC postseason tournam ent.
“Based on the fact w e’ve won every game at
home, it would be a nice advantage,” said
Huneke.
D arren Snyder of Wichita, Kansas continues
to lead the Cougars with 11 goals and four
assists.
S IU E g o alkeeper A ndy K orbesm eyer is
third in the GLVC with a 0.94 goals against
average and 52 saves in 10 games played.

D ru ry ’s 26 in 1990.
Senior Stephanie Kult is fourth
am ong goalkeepers in the GLVC
with a 1.26 goals against average.
A long with Friederich and Kult,
Edw ardsville’s Alison A rnold and
Palm er, A lask a’s Lynda Bowers
received all-tournam ent team hon­
ors at the Cougar Classic.
“It’s nice to be a part of recogni­
tion that w on’t m ean anything until
the end of the season,” head coach
Brian K orbesm eyer said.
The top two team s in the region
figure to advance to the N C A A
T ournam ent, so K orbesm eyer is
hoping his team can continue their
winning ways.
Now we have to m eet the chal­
lenge of being ran k ed No. 3,”
Korbesm eyer said.
SIU E will take on conference
foe and 20th-ranked Missouri-St.
Louis in St. Louis on Wednesday at
7:30 p.m .The SIU E-U M SL alumnus
will take to the field before the con­
test to play an alumni game at 6 p.m.

Lets at least give the Cardinals a chance to lose
L et me see if I’m hearing this right. The A tlanta
Braves have already won the NLCS. So, there is no
need to go forth with the play-offs.
O h yes, I forgot the Braves went undefeated this
year and are indestructible. Therefore, why bore the
viewers with the in-betw een garbage that proceeds
to the obvious outcom e. Braves win in four games
against the lucky-to-be-here Cardinals.
H old th at thought, this just in...The Braves have
lost som e gam es this year. They can actually lose.
This pow erhouse that so m any prem aturely call the
cham pions has som e m arks in the loss column.
W ith th at in m ind the C ardinals still have a
chance. Since o th er team s have beaten this A tlanta
squad, then the C ardinals can too Right?
Luckily, I have o th er reasons to believe the
C ardinals shouldn’t be counted out just yet.
Lets look at the starting lineups by position. You’ll
find they are not that different.
A t right field the C ardinals have their 30-home
run 80-RBI guy, R on G ant, who only played in 130
games. Point being he could have had b etter num ­
bers in a full season.
O n the o th er side, the Braves counter with Ryan
K lesko who had a great break- out year with 34

hom e runs, 90 R B I’s and a decent batting average.
Not a whole lot of difference betw een the two,
offensively or defensively.
Moving over to C enter field. These two team s
probably have the best defensive center fielders in
the league. R ay Lankford did
it all for the Cardinals this
season with 22 hom e runs, 80
R B I’s, .270 batting average,
34 stolen bases plus only one
erro r in the field.
M arquis Grissom had just
about the sam e num bers to
give A tlanta a solid center
fielder. The only difference is
Grissom stole 28 bases and
had a better average. Still not
Todd Spann
much difference.
In right field I’m going to
give the nod to the C ardinals Brian Jordan, who gave
St Louis a gold-glove-caliber fielder, .310 batting
average, 17 hom e runs, 104 R B I’s, and 20 stolen
bases. H e can do it all.
W hether it is R obert Dye or even David Justice,
A tlanta can’t add up to Jordan. For one, Dye is a

Rookie and Justice has not faced any game time
pitching since early in the season.
The infield goes to A tlanta because of their
strength at the corners with Fred M cGriff at first and
Chipper Jones at third. Together these guys had 58
hom e runs and 217 R B I’s. Plus a .300 batting aver­
age.
The Cardinals counter with John M abry at first
and G ary G aetti at third. These two were productive
with a com bined 36 hom e runs, 154 R B I’s, and a .280
batting average, but not as much as the A tlanta duo.
S h o rt stop and second base are very close
betw een these two clubs. A tlanta will start Jeff
B lauser at short and M ark Lem ke at second.
The C ardinals have one thing the Braves do n ’t-A
Wizard. This could be the inspiration they need, let’s
win one m ore for Ozzie Smith.
The pitching staff may m ake the difference and
experts are saying the C ardinals do n ’t have a chance
against the best staff in baseball.
The Cardinals pitching of Todd Stottlemyre, Andy
Benes, D onovan O sborne and A lan Benes can just as
easily shut down A tlanta. As I showed you above,
this is not a great A tlanta hitting team. They are stop­
pable.
