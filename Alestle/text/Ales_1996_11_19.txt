Student senate addresses several topics
By Ed Hawkins
News Reporter
Student governm ent m et Friday to discuss
topics affecting every student. A transient
crowd of six o r seven was on hand at the
Goshen Lounge to hear about Tower Lake
shuttle buses, student fees, parking problem s
and the intriguing concept o f having an
emergency food pantry for hungry Tower Lake
residents.
Much of the discussion focused on M C T’s
refusal to consider “special” bus service to the
upper 500 level of Tower Lake apartm ents.
The reason initially given by M CT officials was
that the buses were too wide to negotiate tight
spaces, but the fact that the bus services the
area at night seem ed to co n trad ict this
reasoning
Senators reported that M CT officials were
not giving them any straight-forw ard answers
about the topic and that M CT had changed
their story, now contending that sending day
buses to the upper 500 side would interfere
with the current schedule.
The Senate is also reviewing departm ent
budgets to m ake recom m endations on student
fees for the 1999 school year. P resident

C hristopher Nance said. “ If there are any fee
increases they will be justifiable.”
Changes in student housing were also
addressed. Nance told the senate that $15
million was needed to build a new freshm an
Residence Hall and $13 million was needed for
Tow er Lake renovations in o rd e r to
accom m odate future housing demands.
“The Tower Lake renovations are way past
due, the Chancellors are trying to cut back, but
$13 m illion is n eeded at Tow er L ak e ,”
P resident N ance said. Phasing out family
housing at Tower Lake, as well as getting rid of
private room s at the Residence Hall, were two
options discussed.
The proposed new policy m eans families
that currently inhabit some apartm ents on the
400 side could continue to do so until they
g rad u ate, but no new family housing
applications would be accepted.
“Elim inating family housing is too high a
price to pay in o rd e r to m eet the rising
dem ands of housing freshm en,” Nance said
Senate Vice President Jam es Little brought
light to the existence a food pantry for
residents of Tower Lake A partm ents.

collected canned goods for the G len-E d food pantry

Blacks and whites march for peace

State and Local

ST. PET ER SB U R G , Fla. (AP)
A b o u t 60 blacks and w hites
m arched through the streets of
riot-torn St. Petersburg on Saturday, urging community members to put
their differences aside for the good of the city.
“I felt the com m unity has a real need to heal itself,” said Ivan Tucker,
a m em ber of the University of South Florida Association of Black
Students. “You’re not going to do that sitting at hom e.”
St. Petersburg was throw n into an all-night riot on Oct. 24 after officer
Jim Knight shot and killed 18-year-old TyRon Lewis. O n Wednesday,
the city was plunged into similar unrest after Knight was cleared by a
grand jury.
M archers, both black and white, peacefully trekked through the city’s
south side, w here Lewis was shot. Walking where glass and debris
littered the streets, some dem onstrators called for peace while others
pressed for justice.

University of Illinois trustees approve tuition hikes

International---------------------------------------Minor quakes shake Japan
TO K Y O (A P) — A n earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
reading of 4.0 shook a chain of islands southwest of Tokyo early Sunday.
A nother quake with a m agnitude of 3.2 hit the same area, the waters
around the Izu chain of islands, 190 kilom eters (120 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, about four hours later. There were no immediate reports of
damage or injuries from either earthquake.

CH IC A G O (A P) — A ttending the University of Illinoi
is getting m ore expensive.
The university system’s Board of Trustees on Thursda;
approved tuition hikes of between three percent and fiv<
percent at the three campuses. University officials say th(
money is needed to m ake academic improvements such a
reducing class sizes and equipping com puter labs.
Tuition will rise by five percent at the main campus ii
U rbana-C ham paign. T h a t’s a $158 increase fo
undergraduates and a $180 increase for graduate students
Tuition will rise to $3,308 for undergraduates and $3,770 fo
graduate students.
Students in law school and graduate library scienci
students also will pay an extra $500 per year.
Housing rates at the U rbana-Cham paign campus also wil
rise by 3.3 percent, from $4,560 to $4,710 for the standan
plan. Fees will rise by $28 to pay for improvements t<
Assembly Hall, the Illini U nion and other facilities.
The trustees also approved undergraduate tuition hike
of three percent at the Chicago campus and 3.2 percent a
the Springfield campus.
“Quality always costs money,” trustee Judith Reese sai<
before Thursday’s vote. “Tuition and fees don’t seem to bi
turning people away.”

letter to the ed itor-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,_____

Violence against women is violence against children
I write on w om en’s issues, feminist theory and
speak on gender inequality at every available
opportunity. W hen I write about women and abusive
relationships, I argue ardently that the reasons
wom en stay or leave abusive relationships has
nothing w hatsoever to do with the cause of the
violence perpetrated against them but everything to
do with the social system that allows, and even
encourages it.
I argue that this, a capitalistic society, dem ands
(gender) inequality for the order of society, in that
how this society m eets its fundam ental needs
requires a workplace that survives on homosociality
and only the advantaged (gender) prospers. That
advantaged g en d er (usually m en) has its own
hierarchy, of course, but shares in its dom inance
over women. W hen I speak, I describe the societal
norms, values and traditions that support (usually
men) who batter, rape and beat (usually wom en) and
spend quite a bit of time, as my departm ent chair
states m atter-of-factly, personally invested in
fighting the system and the unfairness of the
advantage men share.
However, just about the time 1 think I know
something, I discover som ething com pletely new or
come across some unresolved o r unexplored facet.
Recently, I becam e aware of just such a long sought
after piece of the puzzle that fits into what I have
learned about the social phenom ena of violence
against w om en, and m en who d o n ’t pay child
support. Both phenom ena happen with abounding
regularity and carry with them societal norms, values
and traditions that not only support but encourage
them. This leaves many w om en struggling to survive
physically and em otionally and leaves a very bitter
taste because the struggle to survive one often
involves the struggle to survive the other, and both
are nestled within the social netw ork designed to
protect those who need it the least.
In making sense of this recently uncovered, and in

this case, long sought after piece of inform ation,
som ething startling becam e visible. This finally
articulated piece is perhaps the most pervasive way
of all that society finds to support battering men and
‘blam e the victim ’ once again. In cases where men
have raped, beat, battered and even killed the
m others, arguing what ‘she should have been doing’
or ‘could have been doing’ or ‘why she stayed’ or
‘why she didn’t leave’, serves as no better a way to
‘blame the victim’ than preserving the sanctity of his
‘fatherhood’.
The irony of this unequalness has reached me in
my own home. It has left in its wake so crushed and
defeated a hum an spirit as could ever be m atched by
a blow from a batterer. I would feel no compulsion
whatsoever to pull a rapist or batterer off the local
street corner and say, “H ere, be a role model for my
children”. Not in the least little bit, nor would I feel
the slightest of guilt. However, daily I am told,
overtly with individualistic, legally and judicially
supported talks of ‘father’ rights, and covertly with
norm s, values, traditions and social forces that
preserve these m en’s (men who batter, rape and
abuse) ‘right’ to fatherhood.
W hat b e tte r way to get w om en to doubt,
minimize and even blame themselves than to force
them , not to only endure a continued relationship, if
only vicariously through the children, but to support
such a relationship because, after all, H E is their
father. W hat b etter way to put w om en in so
precarious a position. While encouraging women on
the surface, to leave abusive relationships, this is yet
another way to keep them with one foot in the
cesspool, and one m ore way m en get away with it.
Men beat, batter and rape women because they
benefit and because they get away with it.
W omen are never forced to have a continued
relationship with a man who has assaulted, raped or
beat her UNLESS, of course, he is her husband or
the father of her children and then all bets are off

and it is assumed forced and im posed contact is in
the best interest of the children, and she must. This
se ids horribly disconcerting and dem otivating
messages, because one, it tells women that the
terrible injustice they endured must be overlooked,
ignored and meaningless, and two, powerholds the
notion men who are capable of physical, sexual,
em otional and m ental torture are good role models
for children.
I, som etim es would like to batter the person
myself who says to me, “Well, after all, he was only
m ean to you, or, he only beat you up, or, he didn’t
really hurt the children, or, maybe the kids didn’t
really see that m uch”. It does much to weaken
w om en’s confidence by telling them that they d o n ’t
m atter, and worse yet, th at even at their own
expense, the father’s image must be preserved and
T H E Y must be the ones to preserve it.
A nd what about the children? W hat messages are
we sending our children? The best kind of role
m odels for children are people, not m en or women,
but people who act decently, responsibly and show a
keen sense of justice and fair play. Covering up for
louses by instilling a false sense of loyalty and
allegiance from children only teaches children that
they ‘m ust’ and ‘should’ love people who treat them
badly, hurtfully or negligently. O u r young girls
especially, grow up conform ing to these societal
ideals and end up in battering relationships. Society
then, deals them a very dirty deal because the focus
is not on why men are acting that way, but instead on
themselves and why aren ’t they doing som ething to
stop it, fix it or put up with it.
Parenting is a privilege not a ‘right’. Violence
against women IS violence against children. Does
the biological seed give the right to abuse? Yes, sadly
enough in this society it seems so.

letter to the editor

RCM is good for the university and its students

Iota Sweethearts call students
to help a friend in need

Randy H obson’s recent letter to the editor is a positive example of concern for the
economically disadvantaged and would be a useful aid in the discussion concerning
public school funding except that it m isrepresents the basis for Responsibility C enter
Management.
RCM is a m anagem ent program that is designed to create a greater awareness of the
money and energy that is often diverted from an institution’s core mission and expended
on programs and processes that do not necessarily add value to the educational product.
One of the basic tenets of the RCM process in higher education is the notion that the
student is the institution’s ultim ate customer, and that programs that add revenue or
avoid costs but do not serve are to be avoided.
Mr. Hobson believes that RCM is a device that will force the university to “create less
educational opportunity,” simply put, he is wrong. RCM should create more educational
opportunities because it will redirect the attention of managers and adm inistrators of the
university to find better and m ore productive ways to serve our students. RCM, if
successfully im plemented, places a positive burden on every adm inistrator at SIU E to be
more creative and m ore focused in the perform ance of their duties, and places the
institution’s fiscal emphasis where it should be— “on the learning process”.
I recom m end that Mr. Hobson and other students who are concerned or interested in
the impact of RCM to spend some time researching the subject, they may be pleasantly
surprised with what they discover. Randy, give me a call!

NEW Y O R K (A P) — D ecade by decade,
the land has provided: w heat fields, rice
paddies and bulging silos of corn keeping
pace with a growing world population. But
now the grain harvests have leveled off, the
people have not, and the world is left to
w onder where its next century’s meals will
come from.
The blip in the upward slope of grain
production in the 1990s has ready
explanations: Econom ics, politics and
w eather conspired to hold down global output.
But some specialists believe longer-range
forces, from the Kansas prairie to C hina’s
river deltas, are also at work — and the
outlook is troubling.
Troubling enough, in Africa particularly,
for the Food and A griculture Organization to
hold a global summit in Rom e last week to
search for new approaches to help poor
nations grow, buy or otherwise get m ore food.
“We are in a crisis situation,” FAO chief
Jacques D iouf said.
His
U.N.
agency
projects
world
agricultural production m ust expand 75
percent by 2025 to m atch population growth.
It’s not off to a good start.
New FA O figures show that the global
grain harvest, forecast at 1,821 million tons
for 1996-97, will have increased by just 2.3
percent since 1990, while population grows by
10 percent.
G rain is the surest gauge of food supplies
since it provides most of m an’s calories, either
directly or through grain-fed meat.
Because of this lag in production, grain
prices rose and the w orld’s buffer stocks of
wheat, rice and other grains were drawn
down. Reserves now stand at 277 million
tons, some 40 million below what the FAO
considers safe to m eet emergencies.
A mix of factors helped stunt the decade’s
crops: A griculture collapsed with the political
system in the form er Soviet Union, the U.S.
and o th er governm ents began “d e ­
subsidizing” farm ers’ grain surpluses, poor
grow ing w eather plagued A m erica and
Russia, and Chinese grainland was giving way
to factories and exploding cities.
Some see deeper causes, however.
Lester Brown of W ashington’s Worldwatch
Institute m aintains that fertilizers and highyield grain varieties have been pushed to
their limit in many places. A nd underground
w ater sources, from Kansas and C olorado to
Iran and India, are drying up.
“I think each year now it will become m ore
difficult to rebuild grain stocks,” Brown said.
Worldwatch sees China as a huge problem .
Shrinking croplands, rising incomes and a
growing middle-class appetite for m eat, an
inefficient m eans for passing along the
calories of grain, have com bined to turn
China, alm ost overnight, into the w orld’s No.
2 grain im porter, behind Japan.
“It is only a m atter of time until C hina’s
grain im port needs overwhelm the export
capacity of the U nited States and o th er
exporting countries,” Brown contended.
O thers dispute his pessimism. A key FAO
forecaster, Nikos A lexandratos, said Brown
relies on shaky Chinese statistics.

B esid es, h e said , “y o u c a n n o t v isu alize
th e c o e x iste n c e o f a c o u n try lik e C h in a
a d v a n cin g in in co m e an d c o n su m p tio n at

s u p p o rts 60 p e rc e n t o f th e p o p u la tio n ,
go es in to p e rm a n e n t d e c lin e .”
O n the broader, global point, the World
Resources Institute, a Washington think tank,
finds some agreem ent am ong m ajor studies
that birth rates may slow enough to allow a
p lodding agriculture to keep up with
“effective” dem and — the dem and from
consum ers with the m oney to buy.
But that scenario com es with asterisks
attached. In Africa, and o th er poor regions
w ithout that money, hundreds of millions will
rem ain underfed. And a perm anently tighter
balance between supply and dem and will
leave the world m ore vulnerable to w eather
shocks and price shocks.
To L u th e r T w e eten , th e o u tc o m e is far
from clear.
Looking ahead to 2030, the O hio State
University agricultural econom ist stacked the
global trend in per-hectare yields, rising ever
m ore slowly, up against U.N. population
projections. The yields lose out.
“ I d on’t want to take a Lester Brown
approach on this,” Tweeten said, “but the
world cannot be com placent. It’s daunting.”
The specialists say progress must be made
on several fronts:
•R ussia and o th er form er Soviet republics
must be rebuilt into m ajor grain exporters.
•M ore fertilizer should be spread in Africa
and o th er places w here it is underused
because of its expense.
•H igh-production regions must cultivate
what little good land still lies fallow.
•G o v ern m en ts m ust spend m ore on
agricultural research.
Surprising innovations may prove crucial,
Tweeten said. For example, an edible “stew ”
m ade out of dense biomass like willow trees
or sugar cane. “Science is the key to the
future of food,” he said.
At the FAO sum m it, delegates will be
looking for keys to m ore food today.
The FAO estim ates 800 million people are
undernourished worldwide, at a time when
high prices have undercut international food
aid, slicing it in half since 1993 to today’s 7.7
million tons of grain a year.
The summit will try to encourage increased aid,
stepped-up research and pro-agriculture policies in
Africa and other food-short regions.
“T he u ltim ate p roblem is econom ic
d ev elo p m en t,” A lex an d rato s said. “They
must get their own agriculture moving.”
But Brow n sees one m ore ultim ate
solution — population control.
“I think w e’re now in a new situation
w here the prim ary responsibility for
balancing food and people lies with family
planners, ra th e r than fisherm en and
farm ers,” he said. “A nd I d o n ’t think the
world has quite grasped that yet.”
Even C hina’s aggressive family planning
will take precious decades to stabilize its
population, now 1.2 billion. By 2025, C hina’s
farm ers, and grain im porters, will have 400
million m ore m ouths to feed.

Art history professor arrested for theft
CO LU M BU S, O hio (A P) — A retired art
history professor was sentenced on Friday to
14 m onths in prison in the theft of pages from
14th century m anuscripts at Vatican and
Spanish libraries.
U.S. D istrict Judge Siisan D lott also fined
A nthony M elnikas, 69, $3,000 and ordered
him to pay for the retu rn , delivery and
restoration of the six pages, which were valued
at up to $200,000. Dlott estim ated restitution
would total about $10,000.
M elnikas taught for 36 years at Ohio State
before retirin g in 1995. A ccording to
testim ony in pretrial hearings, he w anted to
sell the m anuscript pages because he needed
money for his retirem ent.

Police Beat

M elnikas adm itted possessing two pages
from the Vatican Library which prosecutors
said were stolen during a trip he took there in
1987. T he pages w ere from Francesco
P etrarch's ann o tated copy of two ancient
Rom an treatises on farming and war.
Three pages were taken from two Spanish
cath ed ral libraries in 1965 and 1975,
prosecutors said.
The investigation began last year when an
A kron m anuscripts dealer gave two missing
Vatican pages to federal authorities, saying
M elnikas wanted him to sell them.
M elnikas turned over a third Vatican page
to tw o U.S. C ustom s agents when they
interviewed him last year.

failed to yield as she was exiting a parking lane. Wood's car struck G erling’s car
in the right headlight area. No tickets were issued.
On Nov. 12, at 2:39 p.m., police responded to a traffic accident in parking
Lot 5H at Tower Lake. A nthony Stevens, 21, of Edwardsville, was driving
through the lot when Ryan Gifford, 21, of Collinsville, started to back out of a
parking space. G ifford’s car struck Stevens’ car in the left front fender. No

Beer and wine-making a new major
at Oregon State University
CORVALLIS, Ore. (A P) — Enrollm ent is
up in Oregon State U niversity’s food science
departm ent ever since beer and wine-making
were added as a field of study and a brewing
lab opened up.
M ark
D aeschel,
the
school’s first
N or’W ester Professor of Ferm entation Science
said, until now, higher education hasn’t been
too involved with brewing.
T he D e p artm en t of F ood Science and
Technology’s enrollm ent is up 35 percent, in
large part due to the new ferm entation science
program , he said.
“We look at this as an opportunity for OSU
to claim this area and go forward with it,”
Daeschel said.
T he university is responding to the
microbrewing surge in the Pacific Northwest.
O regon leads the way in fostering growth in
the microbrewing industry for several reasons,
Daeschel said.
O regon growers produce plenty of topquality hops and malting barley. The state also
is hom e to a m ajor producer of yeast, Yeast
L a b o r a t o r i e s . A b u n d a n t w a te r h e lp s
w ith th e b re w in g .
“And we've got the custom ers,” he said.
“People want choice, they want diversity. No
m ore white bread and Bud.”
The new ferm entation center was funded
with a gift of about $500,000 w orth of stock in
the N o r’W ester Brewing Co. of Portland, and a
state m atching grant.

The university now offers an undergraduate
degree in food science with an option in
ferm entation science.
Aside from teaching, Daeschel puts on
w orkshops for the brew ing industry and
supervises operation of the Brewers Analysis
Lab, which opened in January.
F or a fee, private brewers can send beer
samples to the lab for testing of chemical,
microbiological and physical qualities, and get
results back in a week or less.
“Each brew er has a bias, this is what I like.
But, is it acceptable to the public?” Daeschel
said. “The bottom line is, does it taste good? If
not, how com e?”
A pilot brewery also has been set up for
students and industry workshops.
D aeschel 'believes O regon m icrobrewers
need to focus m ore on quality control, an area
w here the university’s trouble-shooting
e x p e rtise in fe rm e n ta tio n science sh o u ld
p ro v e h elp fu l.
O n e b a d b a tc h c a n tu r n c u s to m e r s
o ff, h e s a id .
Few of Daeschel’s graduates will end up
actually brewing beer. Rather, many will work
in
quality
control,
distribution
and
m anagem ent. But no m atter their role, they
need to know about the brewing process, he said.
“The nice thing about beer is you can m ake
it anyw here,” Daeschel said. “Because of the
availability and stability of the raw ingredients,
you can crank it out year-round.”

PARIS (A P) — French TV
n etw o rk s’ launch of o n ­
screen ratings for sex and
violence in th eir program s
M onday was mostly ridiculed
and dism issed by m edia
critics and viewers.
The leftist daily, Liberation, said it
was “bizarre’ that only fiction will be
affected by the move the conservative
government insists is self-regulation
rather than oensodrip. TV rews
magazines, reality shows and talk
shows will be exempt.
Conservative senator Jean
Cluzel defended the ratings
as a useful tool for parents.
“We have to teach children
how to use (the television) as
we teach them how to use
m atches,” he said.
P art of a wider campaign
against violence in the media,
the state-sponsored four-level
ratings featu re geom etric
signs transm itted in the lower
right side of television screens.
Each netw ork will have its
own “Watching C om m ittee”
to rule on the following
criteria:
•no sign — all audiences
•green circle — parental
guidance suggested
•o ran g e triangle — not
recommended for 12 and under
•red square — 16 years old

had
pushed Bourges to move up
the ratings launch, originally

Politicians,
including
Juppe, have avoided blaming
televised
violence
for
violence on the streets, saying
their concern is only to keep
su ch p ro g ra m m in g aw ay
from ch ild re n .
Some observers say Juppe,
unable to get rid of France’s
reco rd
12.6
percent
unem ploym ent seen as a
cause of crime, has turned to
an easier target.
“ In periods of social
tension, television ignites all
the critics,” Liberation said.

Friday at a sym posium on

“Prenatal care, H ead Start

is the alternative to jail care
and welfare on the back side,”
Jackson told reporters after
his speech to a prim arily white
audience of 1,500 people at
Valparaiso University’s Chapel of
the Resurrection.
“ W hen you cut prenatal
care, H ead Start and day care,
you increase school dropouts

the end of that line, often
prem ature deaths and jails.
So, we m ake a m istake when

“These are our children.
Shall we lift them up or lock
them up? They were not born
the way they are. We must do
som ething to put them on a
path that leads to hope and
fulfillment and not to death
and destruction,” he said.
Jackson also called for a

Talkin' trash with Dom Irrera
By Corey Stulce
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
The last lime Dom Irrera was in St. Louis it was so cold, he
thought people would be nuts to go out. Fifteen m inutes later, after
an invite from the emcee, he was on his way to a strip club without
a coat.
This w eekend, the com edian brings his act back to St. Louis at the
Laugh Tracks comedy club in Union Station. Irrera spends half of his
time with stand up com edy and the other with acting projects. He
currently hosts the Cable Ace award winning “Full Frontal C om edy”
on Showtime and does voices for two anim ated series. Irrera was
kind enough to share his thoughts on life, love and the
search for a good meal on the road.

I read that you’re planning your own animated series.
What will it be like?
I ’m gonna be a high school teacher. I’ll be playing my
character from “Dr. Katz.” I t’s m ore for adults.
How do you like acting?
I like acting half the time and doing com edy half the time. I like
the variety. T h at’s why I can't be faithful to one woman. I love
variety. If I’m with a girl w ho’s really built, I want a fat girl.
It never stops.
Is anything ‘off limits' as far as
your comedy goes?

What were you like as a kid?
I was a retard.

I d o n ’t think it’s hip to be
m ean. I d o n ’t m ind busting
chops a little. This hip being
m ean, alternative comedy. Well,
w h a t’s th e \ altern ativ e to
comedy, tragedy.

Would you like to elaborate a bit?
I was a real retard. I m ean, I w asn’t the
kind who could play in the Special
Olympics. I was re ta rd e d w ithout
the perks.
Why did you choose comedy?
I d idn’t choose com edy my friend, com edy chose me. You’re thinkin’, “Wow
what an a**hole this guy is. H e took him self so seriously.”
Okay, let me change the question, how did you get started in comedy?

What did you think o f the election?
It was no surprise. I think the Holyfield/Tyson fight was m ore of a surprise,
and m ore people watched it. The way they campaign, saying they’re the common
man. “I'm just like you.” I d o n ’t want som ebody just like me, some com edian who
tries to pick up waitresses in the W hite House.

I was a really bad waiter. I w orked in a coat room , I lost a coat. I parked cars.
I had no choice. Luckily, I was funny enough to get paid, cause I was bad at
everything else. It was a process of elim ination.

Cougars start season off with victory
H arkins 21 points, 11
rebounds led the way
against McKendree

By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIUE men’s basketball
team rolled past Puerto RicoMayaguez in their season opener
90-71 on Friday night at the
Vadalabene Center.
Jason Holmes led the
Cougars’ offensive attack shoot­
ing 7 for 11 from the field and
sinking 10 of 12 from the freethrow line for 26 points.
“We accomplished several
of our goals in this game,”
head
coach
Jack
M arg en th aler
said
on
Monday. “We put good defen­
sive pressure on the ball and
were very aggressive in our
rebounding.”
Ronnie H enderson added
17 points and grabbed a team high, 10 rebounds in 32 m in­
utes on the court. M arlin
C lark and Chris B refeld
scored 15 and 11 points
respectively.
The Cougars took a 38-31
halftime advantage, but in the
second half, P u erto RicoM ayaguez’s Rafael M artinez
went on a ram page scoring 26
of his 37 points to keep his
team close. The Cougars kept
their lead thanks to an 18-8
run in the second half to shut
the d o o r on M artinez and
Puerto Rico-Mayaguez.
“A n offensive key was that
we had a balanced scoring
attack ,” M arg en th aler said.
“We still need to im prove on
the defensive side of the ball.”
SIU E shot 45 percent from
the field and 76 percent from
the free-throw line.
The Cougars will host OlivetNazarene in a 7:30 pm. contest
tonight. The St. Louis Rams
Cheerleaders will be the Cougars’
halftime guests.
M argenthaler said, “This
will be a big challenge for us.
They are a very aggressive
team and have a lot of size on
their front line. H enderson
and (Travis) W allbaum will
have their hands full. We need
to stay consistent on offense
to give ourselves a chance to
win the game.”______________
The Cougar Basketball
Booster Association will host
a special postgame social
event at the Sunset Hills
Country Club. A ticket stub
from tonight’s contest will
give anyone free entry into
the event. For more informa­
tion about the event, please
call the SIUE Athletic
Department at 692-2871.

■(right) added 15 points, 9
assists, 3 steals and 2 block
shots in a 8 5 -6 0 drubbing .
Phillips was just one of five
players in double figures.
The Cougars w ill play their
first home game tonight in
the Vadalabene Center at
5 :3 0 p.m. against O akland

Five players in double figures helped
the Cougars defeat M cKendree College
85-60 Friday night in Lebanon, 111.
Alicia Harkins lead the attack for the
Cougars as she threw in 21 points and pulled
down 11 rebounds in the season opener.
“ H arkins came out and played well
for us. We had five players in double fig­
ures so our offense is looking good. W hat
we will try to do in the next game is to
improve on defense,” head coach Wendy
H edberg said.
Last week H edberg wanted to use this
game as a way to m easure where there
are at as a team.
“Being our first game the turnovers
were high but we will improve on that,”
H edberg said.
The Cougars turned the ball over 27
times to M cK endree’s 23.
But the game was controlled by the
Cougars from start to finish. Building a
halftim e lead of 42-22, the Cougars went
into the second half without missing a
beat.
In the second half the Cougars contin­
ued their dom inance by shooting 50 per­
cent (18-36)from the field and also hit­
ting 50 percent (5-10) from beyond the
three point mark.
On the game the Cougars shot 52 per­
cent from the field.
Along with H arkins putting in good
m inutes Leslie Phillips added 15 points, 9
assists, 3 steals and 2 blocks.
The Cougars are getting ready for
tonight’s action against O akland City in
the V adalabene C en ter at 5:30 p.m.
H edberg believes they will be fine.
“ It's all ju st a m atter of playing
together and getting a feel for one anoth­
er,” H edberg said. “We should be fine
after that happens.”

Club ice hockey loses inaugural game
Jeff Rasch scores first goal ever for team but loses 9-4 to Illinois-Danville
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The S IU E ice hockey club team took the ice for the first
game of their inaugural season on Sunday, Novem ber 9th
against the University of Illinois-Dansville despite overwhelm ­
ing odds.
The Cougars lost 9-4 to a hard-hitting Illinois-Danville team
who had 25 skaters to S IU E ’s 14.
Jeff Rasch gave the Cougars confidence by scoring the first
goal in the history of SIU E ice hockey with a wrist shot from the
high slot. D an Kennedy and M att Foristal assisted on the tally
which gave the Cougars a brief 1-0 lead.
Illinois-Dansville came back to tie the game 1-1 and used
their physical play to pul the game out of reach.
SIU E received a shorthanded goal from Kennedy and a goal
from D erek Zirkelbach with Paul Ward assisting.
Rasch beat the Illinois-Dansville goalie for a second time

with a pass from Zirkelbach to conclude the SIU E scoring.
The C ougar’s goaltender, D erek Schmalz, stopped 63 of 71
shots in his SIU E club hockey debut.
“We played well against a team which had quite a few advan­
tages over us,” defensem an M att Foristal said.
The C ougar’s next test will be at St. Louis University on
D ecem ber 13 and 14.
“We were proud of the way we played in our first game con­
sidering this was the first collegiate game for the majority of us,”
Foristal said. “ If we play with confidence we have a great chance
to beat SLU.”
SLU is another first year team which once had nationally
ranked hockey team s before having the program fold.
Foristal said, “They’ll be tough since they’ve been in the col­
legiate hockey environm ent before.”
S IU E ’s head coach Bill Misiak would like to encourage any­
one who is interested in playing on the club hockey team to con­
tact him at 659-2159.
