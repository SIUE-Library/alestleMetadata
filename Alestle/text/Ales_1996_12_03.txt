State and Local
Edgar’s referendum plan attracting little support
criminals. A century after earning a reputation for doggedly pursuing
stagecoach robbers, the California bank is still chasing outlaws, this time
via “w anted” posters dispatched across the new frontier of the Internet.
The com pany’s website shows a series of small photographs of
suspects, m ost of them gleaned from fake drivers licenses used in
transactions. Clicking on a small photo yields a bigger picture, the price
Wells Fargo has put on the suspect’s head and brief details of the crime.
Rew ards range from $1,000 to $5,000. Wells Fargo revived its wanted
posters in 1991, distributing paper posters in the vicinity of unsolved
crimes. So far, the bank has put out posters on about 100 suspects; about
30 percent of those pictured have been arrested. The Wells Fargo
website is http://www.wellsfargo.com.

International---------------------------------------Winter blast takes deadly toll in Europe
(A P) — H arsh w eather Sunday lashed E urope from the Alps to Greece,
with a record snowfall on Swiss peaks and deadly flooding in the
southern Balkans. Snow blanketed the Alps, sending authorities
scrambling to clear avalanches and reach isolated villages. In many
areas, up to 3 feet of snow fell during the w eekend — the most for early
D ecem ber since the Swiss started keeping records 45 years ago. In
northern G reece, a father and his teenage daughter drowned when their
car fell into a flooded rift on a highway in Xanthi, police said. A nother
m an was swept away by a flash flood on the city’s outskirts. In Bulgaria,
officials said two elderly wom en died in flooding.

(A P) — Earlier this year, sparks flew in the legislature ovei
Gov. Jim E dgar’s failed proposal to let Illinoisans vote on i
constitutional am endm ent to set minimum state funding foi
public schools.
This fall, Edgar still has school funding on his mind, bui
he is mulling a milder strategy that is generating no greai
enthusiasm among lawmakers.
Edgar and Republican leaders are discussing w hether tc
ask voters in an advisory referendum next April whethei
the legislature should overhaul school funding. The
outcom e would not be binding but lawmakers could use il
for political cover if they do act.
This plan faces two problems: school funding is sc
complicated that many doubt it can be boiled down to s
simple question, and spring may not be the right time foi
such a vote. While many communities have local elections
in April, Chicago is a m ajor exception.
Some say it would be impractical and expensive to set up
balloting simply for a nonbinding referendum .
Edgar wants to give voters a voice and change school
funding in Illinois. The state’s share of education funding
has fallen from 47 percent in 1976-77 to 32 percent during
this school year. Local p ro p erty taxes m ake up the
difference, which creates a disparity between wealthier and
property-poor districts.

Comentary By
Darryl Howlett
Good-bye is only
a preview of
better things to
come

/

Two years of Alestle reporting is coming to an
end. Two years to reflect on chasing stories from one
end of the campus to another. Two years to reflect on
all th e com plim ents I ’ve received on articles
I’ve written.
B eing a jou rn alism stu d en t req u ires great
responsibility. You’re n o t only dealing with
presenting facts to the public, but you’re also dealing
with people’s well-being. T he press is a mighty tool
that can be used for the benefit of all people.
However, if that tool is abused o r m ishandled it can
become dangerous. So, I hope as I leave the paper
the respect of the press is em bedded in my soul.
O ne of the m ore m em orable m om ents I can
rem em ber that helped define this re p o rter was
during the spring of 1996. I wrote a review about a
comedy show sponsored by a sorority. To be straight
and to the point, I wrote that the show was terrible.
How ever I was not suggesting that the sorority who
put the show on was terrible. Nevertheless, the
sorority was not pleased and let it be known. This

A l e s i l e

event challenged my view on journalism . Writing is
fun as long as people are coming up to you saying
what a great job you’ve done. However, it’s an
entirely different story when the heat is on you. If
you believe in som ething and you’re courageous
enough to write about it—stick to it. But also be
ready to adm it when you wrong—a technique I’m
still working on.
To the adm inistration of this school: what can I
say? You guys are the best politicians this side of the
Mississippi. From M CT to the phone scandal, the
way you handle students’ well-being is som ething
else. Well, at least you won’t have to worry about this
snooping reporter calling or seeing you anymore.
(M aybe.) (This does not apply to all parts of our
adm inistration, for Dr. Em m anuel is a shining light
and an honorable man.)
To this year’s student governm ent, even though
you guys are politicians in your own right, I honestly
believe you have the students’ best interests at heart.
Keep the pressure up on this adm inistration, for
they’re a sneaky bunch of characters.
O ne thing I did take pride in doing, was coveringevents sponsored by minority students on campus.
In a tim e when m inorities are often portrayed
negatively by the media, it was my extrem e pleasure
to bring a voice to your cause. Continue to prosper
in all your undertakings.
To the journalism departm ent, enough has been
said about the quality of the newspaper. These
students who take the time to work on this paper,
come from the journalism departm ent. So when you
berate the paper, you berate yourself. My suggestion
is to close the dam n paper down, and start from

letter to the editor.

Marijuana is not leading the way for the
drug problem in the U.S. — Read Up !
I am writing in response to Jam ie Schm idt’s
letter on “A m erica G oing up in Sm oke” in the
Nov. 14th issue of the Alestle. I believe that
there are some things that need to be corrected
in some of her facts.
First of all there are countless other valid
reasons for legalizing m arijuana other than
“drug wars, gang violence and drug
sm uggling”. F o r instance, hem p, the by­
product of m ariju ana is used in m aking
clothing, paper, building hom es and m uch
more. The fabric m ade by hem p is one of the
strongest fabrics available and o u r own
country used it to m ake military uniforms
during the first world war.
Secondly, m arijuana has a m edicinal value.
It is used to help relieve the painful symptoms
of such diseases as aids, glaucoma, cancer,
nausea and countless others. A nd d o n ’t think
that this is just a ploy that “stoners” came up
with to aid in the legalization of m arijuana. It is
reality, or at least Arizona and California feel
th at way. In the N ovem ber elections, the
citizens of those two states passed a legislation
that allows the legal use of medical m arijuana.
I can guarantee you w on’t see those people
“buying weed and getting stoned along with
C heech and C hong” . T hey are doctors,
lawyers, lawm akers, artists, m others, fathers
and grandparents.
She also stated that the N etherlands had
“disastrous results” from legalizing m arijuana.
Am ong these was a triple increase in drug use
am ong teenagers and a crim e and assault
record that ranked num ber one in A L L of
E urope. O n the contrary, according to
A m sterd am ’s own statistics, there are
approxim ately 6000 hard drug users there
(cocaine and heroin), out of those 6000, 1000
are said to contribute to the crime rate. The
rest of the country’s crime problem comes from

Page

prostitution, tourism and a huge increase in
tran sien t citizens. In fact, the city itself
reported that crime has decreased and that
drug use am ong teenagers has dropped
dramatically. You see the N etherlands do not
have a m arijuana problem , they have a heroin
and cocaine problem , and believe me it does
not stem from m arijuana use.
A nd w hat about the statem en t about
m arijuana being highly addictive? Again, there
is no proof of that. In fact, m arijuana is one of
the only drugs, including alcohol, that does not
have physical signs of addiction. This means if
you miss your daily joint, you’re not going to
hallucinate and have cold chills.
And last but not least, m arijuana is not
leading the way for the drug problem in the
US. T hat would be crack, heroin, rufenals, and
ecstasy. If it were not for those drugs, crime
would not be at an all time high. I’ve never
heard of anyone getting robbed because
som eone needed their daily joint.
It’s really not Ms. Schm idt’s fault that she is
misinformed. People who use m arijuana are
often stereotyped as “stoners”, “weed heads”
or “slackers”. You never hear about all the
advantages to legalizing m arijuana because the
governm ent makes m ore off of it being illegal
than legal. In fact, in 1995 there was one
m arijuana arrest every 56 seconds, and 87
percent of the arrests were under 30 grams. A
person can receive m ore jail tim e for
m arijuana than murder. You’re right, the USA
does need to wake up!!!!

scratch. M aybe then we can have enough reporters.
To Professor Bill Ward (w herever he may be) for
lighting a fire in this journalism stu d en t’s mind, that
will never be extinguished. Long live the press!
To the future reporters of the Alestle, I hope you
succeed where o ther writers failed. No longer will
you have to listen to the police departm ent tell you
we’re continuing our investigation. No longer will
you have to talk to University News Service to tell
you the same things that university officials try to
explain to you. R eporters be bold! Find new and
inventive ways to gather inform ation.
To the Alestle staff, you guys work so hard and
receive so little. K eep reaching for th at perfect
article, column, story. No m atter what anyone else
says, you’re the best to me. A special thank you to
D anette W att for keeping me from going crazy this
semester. How did we do it?
To M elanie A dam s, E D IT O R -IN -C H IE F , I
repeat, ED ITO R -IN -C H IEF, you are the strongest,
m ost dedicated journalist in the world. T hank you
for your understanding of my situation. Sorry, we
w eren’t able to end our careers to g eth er But I know
you will keep up the fight.
To all the Alestle readers, thank you for giving me
encouragem ent when I needed it, and criticism when
it was deserved. Take pride in the fact that you
m olded and shaped a dedicated reporter.
A nd last but not least, who was the dam n Alestle
advice columnist?
(I will try from tim e to tim e, to contribute
enlightening articles and well-developed columns in
the future for the paper.) So long and G od bless.

them and their fellow helpers, who keep the kids
amused while trying to catch the perfect snapshot.
O f course, not all kids warm up to Santa
immediately. Schumacher remembers when
his grandson visited "Santa" last year when
he was two years old. The kid, who had no
recognition of either Santa or the man
under the beard, cried the entire time.
Although Santa managed to give him a
candy cane, he never got to hold his
frightened grandson. A fter his shift was
over, Schumacher listened to his grandson
talk about his new friend, Santa Claus.

by Greg Levrault
For the AlesHe
Christmas creeps closer each year in the
shops and on the television, and that thought
produces dread from the average person. But
one sight of the Christmas season that seems
more welcome the earlier he arrives, is Santa
Claus. Two weeks before Thanksgiving, kids
were already able to talk to Santa Claus, giftgiver to the world, friend of children
everywhere and SIUE graduate.
Pete Schumacher, Class of '72, assumed
the red mantle last year, highly recommended
by others who know his secret identity.
Schumacher is a grandfather, with a 25-year
career in teaching behind him. Throughout
the year, he works with Special Olympics,
helping mentally handicapped children
explore their potentials and dreams.

"I wake up each morning really looking forward to
coming to this job, I really do. I don't care what kind
of day or night I've had before, when I wake up in the
morning and realize I have to come over here and
work..., it's no problem getting me motivated to work.
I guess that's why I do it," Schumacher said.
Santa season started Nov. 15th at St Clair Square.
For five hours a day, one of six Santas sits in the big
chair, collecting kids' wishes and whispers. The

Most kids warm up to Santa immediately.
Even the skeptical ones warm up and talk about
anything after a moment. "The imaginations of
the children that visit Santa are most interesting.
You're so busy in your young life, and now you
have the time to really listen to them; and they
have the wildest stories," Schumacher said.
Children of all ages visit Santa. Last year,
Santa got a visit from a child only ten days old.
Also last year, three marriage proposals were
witnessed by Santa Claus. Schumacher happened
to witness one and
company that provides the Santa service, Santa Plus,
limits shifts for all Santas. Photos are conveniently
available, in packages ranging from $7 to $25. But
any kid can talk to Santa for free.
None of Santa's elves are on site, but Santa has
helpers to manage the constant crowd of eager eyes
and ears. Helping Schumacher on one particular
morning were two of SlUE's ladies of volleyball, Julie
Litteken and Lynette Schrieden. Schumaker praised

Santa's ready for most questions about his work
and his friends. Where does he park the reindeer? On
the roof. How does he cover all the houses by
Christmas? A new engine is in the sled.
For some, however, there's no doubt who sits in the
big ch air. A little girl, pointing to him, told her mother,
'That's old Ho-ho," which is kid talk for "Santa Claus".

Those were the little known facts about the tenth reindeer who led Santa's
sleigh. For years no one knew what had happened on that fateful night when
Tipsy was allowed to lead Santa's sleigh. It was kept under wraps, due to
security measures at the North Pole. Recently, though, an elf has come
forward to share his memories of that night.
His name will remain a secret. For the purposes of this article, he will be

problem. Santa, of course, discovered the problem and told Tipsy to quit the
booze, cold turkey. Tipsy agreed, but with his hooves crossed. He was
apparently too taken by the liquor to quit on his own.
Soon, it was Christmas Eve. Unfortunately, Rudolph had broken a hoof
trying to perform a stunt on a "Circus of the Stars" special with Bea Arthur a
month back. Santa was desperate for a leader. He decided to give Tipsy a

chance, in order to give him respect among the other reindeer.
Tipsy started off fine, but seemed to slow up every time the sleigh would

pass by a tavern. Santa was nearly done delivering the toys when things took
a turn for the worse. Tipsy passed out over New York City and the sleigh took
a quick dive. "Santa was freakin' out! They were droppin' like the
Hindenberg, and there was nothin' they could do about it," said Bernie.
Luckily, Donner and Blitzen were able to glide onto the roof of a theater in

the Redlite District. They put Tipsy into the back of the sled to sleep it off, and
then delivered the rest of the toys. It was daylight by the time they returned to
the North Pole. Santa was very upset. He forced Tipsy to enter AAA (Animal
Alcoholics Anonymous). Today, Tipsy is doing well, and he is in training to
return to Santa's team. He is even considering a name change.
While this was a lighthearted look into drinking and driving and the
problem of alcoholism, the message is a serious one. During the holiday
season, alcohol and depression are in abundance. Be a true friend, and don't
let your loved ones drink and drive. Have a safe and merry New Year.

Gifts for mister "x" this holiday season
By Ty Norris
Lifestyle Editor
Seasons greetings to
everyone! Yes, it is that
time of year a ga in... tis'
the season to be ¡oily, fa la
la la la la la la la.
During this time of year,
shopping for the right gift for the "'x' man" in your
life can be more of a chore, instead of a delight. I
know how you feel. You probably want to stay within
an affordable budget (considering the fact
you still have to live after Christmas) and
you definitely don't want the gift to be
cheesy (no it is not the thought that
counts).
Now, I know you want to get "Mr. 'x'"
something he can use and appreciate, so
the following gifts are merely suggestions
for those betwixt holiday shoppers.
Men want to smell like men, so anything you
might see in the store that is cute, probably won't
go over very well.
You might want to purchase Tommy
Hilfiger's Tommy Body Wash; 6.7 fl. oz.
$12 or All Weather Body Moisturizer;
6.7 fl. oz. $14. If there is one thing
women like that is a man who smells good

and a body wash with a body moisturizer is the key.
These two items are less expensive than cologne sets,
while achieving the same results.
A Clinique Face Scrub $12 is also an ideal gift.
Hey fellas, it feels like grit, but it removes dead skin
flakes and dirt. Clinique also offers a lotion for $10.
The lotion is so unique because it can be applied after
a shave to the face or head, and it helps moisturize
dry, irritated skin.
Many of these items can be found at Famous Barr
or Dillards, but are not limited to them.
A good piece of fiction or non-fiction is always an
exceptional gift. There are books (not magazines),

p a p e rb a c k
or hardcover
that cater to
the AfricanAmerican
male as well
as the Euro­
centric male.
Any book or
novel
that
w o u l d
broaden his
mind would
work. What
do you have
to loose? He
might
just
read it!
If
"Mr.

........

.....- iB — ii ii

'x"'is a sports man, you can get him tickets for his
favorite sport or for any sporting event, and then
shock him by going with him!
Finally, if none of these suggestions work, a gift
certificate from Lord and Taylor's, Structures or
Banana Republic is sure to surprise even the most
difficult man.
Above all, do not go into debt for any gift. Looking
for the right gift doesn't have to be a drag nor does it
have to put a hole in your pocket.
Be safe and enjoy the holiday. I know I will.

Inexpensive and romantic gift ideas

By Melanie Adams
Editor in Chief
With the holidays fast approaching, shopping for gifts for
the love interests in your life can put a cramp in your wallet. But
never fear, here are a few inexpensive and romantic gift ideas
guaranteed to please the love or loves of your life.
Depending on how long the two of you have been together,
one gift idea sure to bring a tear to your loved one's eye is a
memory book, detailing some of the great times the two of you
have shared. All you need is a photo album or scrapbook and
hotos or symbols of the times you have shared. Be sure you
save lots of pages open though so you can record future
memories together on its pages.
Another wonderfully romantic and fa irly inexpensive
g ift for the holidays is a W inter picnic survival kit. The
kit should include a bottle of wine or sparkling cider,
candles, a blanket, your loved one's favorite meal a
good book (such as the" 100 Ways To Say I Love You"
book found in area bookstores,) or a classic movie. Sit
back, curl up in the blanket, sip on the juice or wine and
enjoy each other's company. Inexpensive and tres chicl
Another romantic idea for the financially challenged is a
cassette recording of all the songs that remind both of you of
your relationship. Your love will melt at the sentimental gesture.
N o t h i n g is m o r e r o m a n t i c t h a n a h o r s e d r a w n c a r r i a g e o r t r o l l e y r i d e t h r o u g h an
e nc ha nt ed p ar k f i l l ed wi th t w i n k l i n g lignts.
Dress warmly for this present and don't forget to stop for hot
chocolate afterwards! Carriage and/or trolley rides range in
price from $15 to $45 and can be found all over the St. Louis
Area. Check the local paper for details on rides
and reservations.
The best you could give to your loved one, however, is
something that you can't make, can't buy and can't ever
exchange. The best gift, is your time. As college students,
employees, and even in some cases, parents, time is something
we don't have a lot of. The people we care about the most seem
to get the least amount of our time. So, go shopping together
for friends and family, make cookies together or romp in the
snow. But, spend time together; it is the most romantic and most
appreciated gift you could ever give the one (or ones,) you love
this Holiday season.

Who would have thought a R usted R oot could
grow. T hat’s what has happened though. The band
who started out playing little gigs in Pittsburgh have
gotten bigger, and w ithout the aid of an annoying
Top 40 hit, either. They are growing in their fan base,
and are on their way to becoming a “followed” band,
like The G rateful D ead and Phish before them.
The key to their success has been positive word of
m outh and constant touring, which according to
bassist Patrick Norm an, can be very taxing. “I never
thought it would be. W e’re just never home. It can be
stressful. It’s also cool, though. We get to see many
places around the world and w e’re getting paid for
it,” said Norm an.
The band has recently released their second
album, “R em em ber.” N orm an said the second album

T h e

A l e s t l e

is a bit of a departure from their first, “When I
W oke”. “We got to explore m ore on this album. The
first one was songs w ritten over four years and we
were trying to give it m ore of a live sound to
represent ourselves at the time as clearly as possible.
This album was m ore wide open. We got into the
studio m ore and got to play around with many
different instruments,” said Norman.
U nlike
m ost
bands,
R usted
R o o t’s
unconventional style has each m em ber of the band
jum ping around to try different instruments. For the
song “H eaven,” bass player N orm an decided it
needed a piano part, so he went in and played it.
Being very flexible in their music gives R usted R oot
a very original, even tribal sound.
“I've heard that word [tribal] used a lot to describe
us,” said Norm an. “I think it’s because we have a very
com m unal type of feel, especially in our earlier
shows. It was very intimate. It was the vibe we
grew up in.”
The band has been lucky enough to play with many

Page

legends of the rock world, from The G rateful Dead
to The A llm an B rothers to Willie Nelson. “My
favorites were R obert Plant and Jimmy Page,” said
Nelson. “They were my childhood idols.”

Like mailmen, Rusted Root promises to play rain
or shine, or sick or healthy. Nelson says they have
canceled very few shows because of bad health
because they would hate to disappoint the fans. “I’ve
played deathly ill,” he said. “Everybody plays
regardless, unless we physically cannot get up. I don’t
know if it’s wise or not. It’s very difficult to play when
you’re sick. A lot of energy is expelled while playing.”
A t least th e band has th eir fam ilies with them
on the ro ad to nurse them back to health. Since
they are on the road so m uch, m any family
m em bers to u r along with R usted R oot. They
will be w rapping up for aw hile in D ecem ber
though. A ccording to N elson they need to “take
tim e off to have babies in th e w in ter” .

Alternative holiday CDs to Portraits of Nature
in its rarest form
jam to this holiday season
By Corey Stulce
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
Why must we be tortured
every year with the same old
ram bling versions of Bing
Crosby
singing
“W hite
C hristm as”
or
Jose
Feliciano’s “Feliz N avidad”?
T here
has
to
be
an
altern ativ e for those who
enjoy Christm as songs but
also would like music from
this century. H ere are a few
choices, all unique in and
among themselves, for some
holiday musical enjoym ent.
First, is a selection that
hasn't been available since
1980, “ C hristm as In The
Stars”. R hino R ecords has
rereleased the little-heard
“Star W ars” holiday album.
This selection is for those
fans who ju st ca n ’t have

enough of those two lovable
droids
C-3PO and R2-D2. The
prem ise of the album has
droids w orking in S an ta’s
workshop, and C-3PO trying
to explain what the season is
all about to R2-D2.
The
album
features
original
cast
m em ber
A nthony D aniels as C -3PO ’s
voice. He does a fine job on
singing such songs as “Bells,
Bells, B ells” and the title
track. A very nice bonus on
the cd is Jon Bon Jovi, then
unknown, singing lead on a
track called “ R2-D2 We Wish
You A M erry C hristm as”.
I t’s very amusing to think of a
group of children singing a
carol to R2-D2.
T here is a very zany
num ber that answers the ageold question “W hat Can You

G et
A
W ookie
For
C hristm as”
(W hen
He
Already Owns A Comb). The
album was produced by
M eco M ondaro who was
responsible for the funky
disco versions of the “Star
W ars” them e in the 70s.
Overall, it is a fun album to
listen to, and the songs aren ’t
entirely atrocious. Everyone
should get a good feeling
listening to C -3PO say,
“M erry Christmas, everyone.
A nd may the force be with
you, always!”
Next on the list is “Dr.
D em ento
Presents
The
G reatest Christmas Novelty
CD O f All Time.” The title
certainly lives up to it’s boast.
These

This collection starts of
w ith the im m ortal classi<
“The Chipmunk Song,” fron
David Seville. Everyone car

singing dogs at full volume
The cd also includes the
“Twelve Days of Christmas’
by Bob and Doug McKenzie

also featured on the cd.
The next album feature:
som e classic carols with £
twist, they’re all perform ed bj
the Muppets. U nfortunatelj
the title of the album is “Johr
D enver and The M uppets”
D enver is featured on abou
half of the tracks, but those
can easily be skipped. The
good songs are all done b)
Jim H enson’s Muppets. The
“Twelve Days O f Christmas’
has never sounded better
even
with
Miss

hamming it up. The highlight:
of the cd are a version ol
“Christmas is Coming” done
“in the round”, and a rocking
version of the Beach Boys
“Little Saint Nick” performec
by Dr. Teeth and The Electric
Mayhem. This is a must foi
M uppet fans.
The last of the alternate
selections is a CD put out Iasi
year from Atlantic, featuring
12 A tlantic artists, called “Yoi

album featuring the likes ol
C ollective
Soul,
Juliana

and
Victoria
Williams. There is one song or
the album which m akes il
w orth buying, Jill Sobule
singing “M erry Christma:
from the Family”. This is the
ultim ate dysfunctional carol
for everyone’s family. It tells
the tale of alcoholic aunts
crazy kids and last minute
trips to the superm arket foi
w hipped
cream
and
cigarettes.
All of these selections
should be easy enough to find
in the holiday section at the
local music shop. Just skip

The men's basketball team added two more victories over the break as
they increased their record to 4-1. Shaun Smoot (above) is driving to the
basket in an early game this year in the Vadalabene Center.

The SIU E m en’s basketball team ran its
record to 4-1 with victories over Missouri
Southern and Lindenwood College at the
Vadalabene Center.
Last Tuesday, the Cougars bounced back
from a loss against Truman State to beat
Missouri Southern 83-70.
Senior Jason Holm es led all scoring with
18 points and added 5 rebounds in 33 m in­
utes of play.
Shaun Smoot threw in 14 points, Travis
W allbaum had 12 points with 5 rebounds
and Ronnie H enderson tallied 10 points
and 6 boards for the Cougars.
“We had a balanced scoring attack,”
M argenthaler said. “Everyone contributed
on offense and on defense.”

“I was happy to see us out-rebound
them by 10. They were extrem ely strong
and well coached. We needed a tough game
like this,” M argenthaler said.

The Cougars were victorious again on
S atu rd ay with a 104-68 victory over
Lindenwood College (Mo.).

M argenthaler said.
The Cougars scored 68 in the second
half to put the game out of reach. Rusty
Sarnes had 27 and N athan K reke had 11
points and 10 boards.
“N athan had a com plete ball game,”
M argenthaler said. “H e did som ething in
