Chancellor Belck
addresses student
government
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
A t the invitation of student
government, S IU E C hancellor
Nancy
Belck
addressed
several issues th a t have
students concerned.
A t the stu d en t senate
m eeting held Friday in the
G oshen Lounge, housing was
addressed.
“The question asked is how
to provide m ore housing? We
had to let 150 residents choose
not to go to the university,”
Belck said.
“Now we can fill m ore
residence halls,” Belck said.
B elck is looking over
proposals to alleviate SIU E
housing problem and taking a
num ber of steps.
“I recently signed a letter to
Ted S anders (P resid ent of
SIU) for proposals. One of
the short term solutions would
be having 250 m odular units,”
Belck said. “The long term
solution would be an o th er
250-300 room residence hall.”
B ut the long-term solution,
according to Belck, could take
up to 10 years.
C hancellor Belck
said
other options the university is
looking into includes a private
developer for family units or
quasi-units (4 single units
sharing
a
kitchen
and
bathroom ). She also said the
university is working towards
a G reek Row.
“We definitely have the
ground
space
for
any
additional housing,” Belck
said.
Belck continued with her
message to the student senate
by inform ing them that the
university has interview ed
three people for the position
of director of O IT ( Office of
Inform ation Technology).

S en ato r N icole W atson
asked Belck about plans for a
football team on campus.
“The one single issue is
money. It takes a lot of money
in order to put a football team
together and a stadium. I don’t
see th at m oney on the
horizon,” Belck said.
“I d o n ’t know if we will see
it (team ) in my lifetim e.
H owever, pur (G reat Lakes
Valley) conference does have
football team s if we ever get
one,” Belck said.
Before Belck arrived at the
senate
m eeting,
student
governm ent took care of other
business concerning students.
Because of the resignation
of Senator D em etre Pegues,
due to time constraints, and an
already vacant student senator
spot, the senate had to vote in
tw o new stu d en t senators.
They are R andy H obson and
Joe A rana.
H obson is a form er twotim e student senator who also
ran for student body president
this past spring sem ester
“S tudent retention is the
main reason why I w anted to
be a senator again. Freshm en
say they want to get a degree;
how ever 30 percent (of new
students) are gone by the next
year. It takes seven years for
35 percent of those freshm en
to graduate,” H obson said.

his mind.
“I w anted to be a senator so

A rana said.

University officials m et with SIU E student A pril Smith Tuesday afternoon to address
concerns about the M adison County Transit bus system (M CT). Last Thursday, a letter to the
editor of the Alestle w ritten by Sm ith’s husband, A nthony Smith, told about Sm ith’s incident
with her attem pt to catch a bus back to campus.
M ore than 30 students, including students and a professor from Sm ith’s sociology class
came to support Smith. The m eeting was to offer an apology to Smith and to provide a
solution to prevent future incidents betw een M CT and university students.
Rudy Wilson, acting assistant provost for C ultural and Social D iversity,-m ediated the
m eeting which also included Vice C hancellor of Student Affairs Dr. N arbeth Em m anuel.
Wilson said that the m eeting had two purposes, one was for the bus com pany and the
university to give Smith an apology. The second was to m ake sure that all the parties involved,
were polite and courteous to her.
A lso addressed in the m eeting was the role of University Police in a crisis situation.
Students who attended the m eeting were concerned with accountability when an incident
involving MCT occurs.
“The university is in the process of developing a com plaint form for students. A lso a form
for conduct for bus drivers and students who ride any buses,” Wilson said.
Wilson also rem inded students that they have a university M adison C ounty Transit Board,
headed by Student Body President C hristopher Nance.
Smith agrees totally with her husband’s letter, w ritten to the Alestle.
“I stand by everything in the article, when M CT did call on Oct. 1, they did n ’t sound sincere.
The person who I talked to was Todd Plesko,” Smith said. “They did send me a q u arter back
and 25 free passes along with the letter,” Smith said.
Plesko is director of operations for MCT.
Smith also said that in the letter from MCT, it described her actions as cursing and being
loud on the bus. Smith said that the entire letter was not actually correct.
According to Smith and the university, M CT said the bus driver involved in the incident

District of Columbia to sell prison
to private company

Activist’s death a puzzle to family, friends
AP — A private, Nashville-based
company is buying one of Washington D.C.’s prisons, Mayor Marion
Barry announced Friday. Corrections Corp. of America, one of the
nation’s largest prison contractors will buy the 898-bed facility for
$52 million.
Margaret Moore, director of D.C. Corrections, said the department
will oversee the general management of the facility while
Corrections Corp. of America will run the day-to-day operations.
The private company said it will make $3.85 million in capital
improvements. Barry said once the sale is complete, the district will
lease the prison at a rate of $79.96 per day per inmate. It now costs
the district $91.06 per day per inmate to operate.

AP — Friends and family say they cannot accept Henry M.
Brown Jr.’s death as an accident. The 61-year-old Chicago
court reporter’s body was found floating in the Chicago
River last week.
Brown, alias “Mandrake,” often went undercover on raids
to obliterate tobacco and liquor billboards in the black
neighborhoods of Chicago’s South Side.
Brown’s supporters say they cannot accept the official
verdict of death by accidental drowning, or that he may have
committed suicide. More than 400 supporters signed a
petition asking Chicago police to dig deeper into the
circumstances surrounding his death, saying he made many
enemies during his crusade, and that his car had been
vandalized twice in recent weeks.

Volcano erupts in Iceland
Video to monitor 1-270 traffic
A P — A volcano named, for the Norse god of mischief has been
acting up in southeastern Iceland. Loki is erupting under 2,000 feet
of ice of the Vatnajokull glacier and is threatening farms with molten
rock and meltwater.
Pall Imsland, a geologist at the University of Iceland, said the
eruption sent plumes of steam and ash up to 33,000 feet into the sky
Saturday. The volcano last erupted in 1938.

BELLEVILLE NEW S-DEMOCRAT — Drivers on 1-270
will soon be participating in a new “high-tech highway”
project that will use video cameras and computers to monitor
traffic problems. The system is expected to reduce traffic
congestion and improve safety in accident-prone
construction zones.

letter to the editor

A woman is equal to a man
but is she superior to a child?
W omen have fought a long time for equality, a right too long withheld. To be paid equally
in a job, to advance in a career, to just be treated fairly. It’s frustrating to hear that in many
cases they are still paid less than males for the same job. Some wom en can do a job better than
some men, and m ost can do at least as well.
W omen should not be denied their rights, just for being women.. Some, however, dem and
a right that is not theirs — “reproductive rights,” b etter known as abortion. They reason, “It’s
my body, I can do what I w ant with it.” They give the fetus the status of a “thing” or a piece
of property (a.k.a chattel), by calling it just a lump of flesh or a part of a w om an’s body. W hat
we are really discussing, though, is that which becomes a hum an life if not prevented. The
argum ent for abortion establishes a double-standard. A wom an is equal to a man, but is she
superior to a child? A nd does she have a right to get rid of “it” if she so desires? A nd why is
it just a lump of flesh when it’s not w anted and a child when it is w anted?
The death penalty is decried by some as cruel and unusual, though it’s directed toward those
who have com m itted violent crimes , yet the innocent are put to death because that pleases
the mother. The only “crim e” com m itted by the fetus is that of being unwanted. W hat if you
suddenly becam e unw anted? It’s the death penalty for you. T hat is the reasoning behind
abortion.
I do not apologize if I have offended any abortion proponents by this statem ent. As it has
been said, “T he truth hurts.” I am not asham ed to expose and oppose such a duplicitous act.

For equality against duplicity,

letter to the editor

Not everything is a
Black and White issue
1 am writing in response to the letter w ritten by A nthony
Smith in the Oct. 3 issue of the Alestle. First, I am unclear on
some of the facts. Mr. Smith said that his wife was halfway to
the bus stop when the bus was leaving and th at while she was
running trying to stop him, he pointed rudely and said, “That
is the bus sto p ”. Did he yell this at h e r from the inside of the
bus? Did he stop and tell her this? How does she know that
is what he was saying?
Secondly , we are hearing Mr. Sm ith’s own bias as he is
telling the story He constantly refers to his wife as Mrs.
Smith, which is a courtesy title, but the bus driver is just
Jimmy and the police are m entioned in reference with the
Rodney King beating and the beatings of illegal immigrants.
A re you sure that you’re not the racist Mr. Smith? Right
from the beginning you establish that it was a black and white
issue. Then you accuse the driver, the police, M CT and even
the school adm inistration of being racist.
A nd to the com m ent you m ade that “black wom en have
been raped enough throughout history”, how can you even
com pare being asked to leave a bus with being raped? And
for your inform ation, wom en as a whole have been raped
enough throughout history.
I am not saying what the bus driver did was right or
wrong, but I d o n ’t appreciate you implying that white people
are trying to bring back the days of Rosa Parks.
On the contrary, I wish there w ere m ore cultural diversity
on this campus. Why can’t we just have student organizations
instead of black and white student organizations? Why does
everything have to be a black and white issue? My husband
is black and my son is mixed; I would like to raise him in a
society where the color of your skin doesn’t matter.
How can we ever do this if we are constantly pointing
fingers and laying blam e on the o ther race?

4A l Salvi has more traditional fam ily values in his
little finger than Durbin has in his whole body!’
In Chicago (July 2) at a$600,000 fund raiser for Richard D .D urbin, Co-President Clinton
stated, “ We want a candidate who lives family values and doesn’t give speeches about them
during election tim e.”
A pparently this statem ent doesn’t include the values of families of veterans who believe our
flag should not be desecrated, as D urbin continuously votes against a Flag Protection
A m endm ent.
Many feel the am endm ent is needed after what happened at the Phoenix A rt M useum. The
exhibit, “ Old Glory: T he A m erican Flag in C ontem porary A rt”, showed our flag stuffed into
a toilet and another display invited visitors to walk on a flag spread on the floor and then write
their thoughts in a book.
The highly opinionated D urbin should give thoughts on G eorgetow n college chum
(Clinton) who organized anti-U.S. protests which included flag burning! Does D urbin envision
family values in C linton’s travels to Russia in 1969, when that country supplied N orth Viet Nam
with the weapons th at were used to inflict 58,000 A m erican casualties?
In Somalia, U.S. military com m anders requests for tanks were refused by the Clinton
adm inistration resulting in 18 U.S. A rm y Rangers being killed in a firefight! A t Arlington
National Cemetery, V.P. G ore consoled wives and parents by saying that their loved ones “died
in the service of the U nited N ations” !
Voting to place U.S. troops under U.N. com m and, D urbin doesn’t share the values of
military personnel who believe their only allegiance is to the U.S. and not the U .N .’s global
village!
Mr. (fam ily values) D urbin voted to spend tax p ay ers’ m oney to teach children
hom osexuality is a positive lifestyle (Mar. 24, 1994), gave us taxpayer-subsidized exhibits of a
crucifix subm erged in urine and artistic photos of a m an urinating in the m outh of another!
D u rb in ’s o p p o n e n t, U.S. Senatorial candidate A1 Salvi, has m ore T R A D IT IO N A L family
values in his little finger than D urbin in his entire ultra-left body!

“W e’re not th ere to p ro m o te one

Smith said that a letter of apology from
M CT did arrive at her Tower Lake A partm ent
this past Saturday. The letter was dated Oct. 1.
No represen tativ e from M CT was at the

m eeting, and Smith along with university
officials are still unclear as to why it took
M C T over three weeks to offer Smith an
apology. The Alestle was unable to contact
Jerry Kane, m anager of M CT for comment.

R em em ber the 1970s talent show
called “The G ong Show?”
O n W ednesday, Oct. 2, nearly a
dozen contestants appeared in the first
annual S IU E p ro d u ctio n o f “The
G ong Show.” The show was presented
as ju st one o f the activities for
H om ecom ing W eek 1996.
The original talent show from the
‘70s featured contestants who came on
stage to perform acts raging from song
and dance to comedy. Each act was
judged by three judges. If the judges
liked an act, the perfo rm er would
receive a score. But, if the act was
rejected by the ju d g es... GONG!
“We gonged when we needed to
gong,” said Tiffany Hicks, one of the
three judges for S lU E ’s version of the
popular 1970’s television show, and a
g rad u ate advisor from
Kim m el
Leadership.
“I thought it was a good turnout,
and everyone who participated in ‘The
G ong Show’ exhibited true spirit for
Hom ecom ing W eek,” Hicks added.
The m aster of cerem onies of “The
G ong Show” was D an K asten, A lestle
A dvertising C oordinator.
“It was fun,” K asten said. “The acts
were cool. Initially, there were seven
acts th at had signed up to perform .
Only five o r six showed up, and a few
chickened out.
“W hen the first person got up to
perform he did a K araoke type act to a
country song. H e was great, like a real

The question was answ ered at the action next w eekend against IU PU 70:45 m ark w hen Ashley scored his Fort Wayne and N orthern Kentucky.

Saturday afterno o n the C ougars w el­
com ed the No. 4th ranked team in Division II
soccer, Trum an State.
Also, the University of Missouri St. Louis
and D rury were in attendance for the annu­
al C ougar Classic.
It took nine m inutes for the Cougars to
get som ething started on offense as they
looked to sophom ore Janece Friederich to
supply the goals.
F riederich scored four goals for the
Cougars, and that would be all the C ougar
defense needed as SIU E w ent on to win 4-2.
“I think Truman overlooked us due to last
year’s perform ance w hen they won by three
goals. The girls really prepared hard for this
gam e and it showed,” head coach B rian
Korbesm eyer said.
The next day the Cougars played D rury
who was another tough regional opponent.
Coming into the game, the Cougars were
9-0-1 and Drury posted an 10-2 record. So
SIU E had their work cut out for them com ­
ing off a big victory.
But the Cougars hung in the game and
came out with a 1-1 tie.
“We showed a lot of m aturity with this
game. Coming off a big em otional win we
could’ve lost big to this team .,” Korbesm eyer
said. “D rury is a good team and I do think if
we are at full strength we would beat them .”
