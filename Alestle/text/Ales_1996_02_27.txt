America's best known principal speaks at SIUE
By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
An estimated 700 students, faculty and members of the
community were entertained by America’s best known
principal, Joe Clark, through a riveting speech he delivered
in the M eridian Ballroom on Thursday, Feb. 22.
Clark has appeared several times on 60 Minutes, has
published a book about his experiences at Eastside High
and has been on the cover of Time magazine. The movie
Lean On Me was based on Clark’s book, and he has
received job offers from former president Reagan.
Clark, through his speech entitled “Education with a
M ission,” called the crowd to stand up and make a
difference.
“Stand tall, make a difference, bring about a
rejuvenation in our country. You can sing about peace on
earth, and preach about peace on earth, but if you don’t
have it in your hearts, it won’t happen,” Clark said.
Clark went on to quote famous people such as Booker T.
Washington and Henry Ford, telling the audience to act
now on their beliefs, to be bold and take life on.
“If you don’t stand for something, you will fall for
anything,” Clark said.
Clark went on to add that people do not act because of
fear and a lack of knowing the purpose of why they are
living.
“We go through life afraid of things that don’t exist but
keep us in virtual stagnation,” Clark said. “I fear no one! I
don’t care if people like me, I’m doing what I am supposed
to do, and that is why I am happy.”

University makes updates to Sexual Harassment Policy

Over the course of the past 18 months, SIUE’s Human
Relations Advisory Committee, the Human Relations Office,
the Office of the General Counsel, the Faculty, Staff, and
Student Senates and the then-President’s office have been
diligently updating SIUE’s Sexual Harassment Policy.
The policy, effective immediately, outlines what the
university considers to be sexual harassment, states procedures
for dealing with reports of sexual harassment, explains the
function of the Sexual Harassment Committee and Advisers
and diagrams training procedures. The policy covers all
students, faculty and employees of the university.
The SIUE policy follows Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEO C ) standards when defining sexual
harassment and divides the definition into two categories.
“Quid pro quo” sexual harassment, according to the EEOC
as stated in the policy, occurs when an employee’s submission to

unwelcome sexual conduct becomes an explicit or implicit
condition of employment, or when personnel actions such as
promotion, transfer, compensation or discipline are determined
on the basis of an employee’s response to such conduct. This
form of harassment could also be applied to a teacher/student
situation in which a student’s grade or class standing is put at
risk because of such behavior.
“Hostile environm ent” sexual harassment is defined as
unwelcome sexual conduct which unreasonably interferes with
an individual’s job or academic performance or creates an
intimidating, hostile or offensive work or learning environment.
This type of incident is most likely to occur between students or
people who work in the same office or area.
The policy also prohibits consensual relationships between
faculty and students and supervisor and employee. Kim L. Kirn,
University Legal Counsel, commented on this section of the
policy in a telephone interview on Monday.

U.S. planes shot down by Cuba
•The United States decried
on Sunday Cuba’s downing of
two small American planes as
“a
blatant
violation
of
international law.” But the only
immediate U.S. response was to
ask the U.N. Security Council to
investigate and to condemn the
downing. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said that
four people aboard the planes
were killed.

•Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan, returning

dared the U.S. government to

his trip was to preach peace

challenged critics to find
something wrong with that.

and Guerrero states and
measured 5.2 on the Richter
scale, the National Seismological
Service said.

Four stores targeted in alcohol crackdown
•An ongoing effort to stop the sale of alcohol to minors led police to issue
tickets Saturday night to employees of four stores in the city.
Fairview Heights Police Sgt. Richard Allan said a team comprised of Detectives
Kathy Bailey and William Newgent used an undercover operative under 21 to visit
the establishments and purchase alcohol.
Tickets for the unlawful sale of alcohol to a minor were issued to employees at
the Clark station on Ruby Lane, the Gas Mart East on Pasadena Drive at Illinois
50, the Moto Mart on Illinois 159 and Teacher’s Billiards on Illinois 159 near
Drake Road.

•Retired Gen. Colin Powell said Sunday that the 1991 Persian Gulf War had a

the glory of those who served in it.
“The goals we were fighting to achieve were crystal clear: to eject the Iraqi army
from Kuwait and restore the legitimate government” after the oil-wealthy emirate
was annexed by Iraq, said Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Majority wants president to quit, newspaper says
•Most Colombians want President Ernesto Samper to step down until Congress
passes judgement over the latest drug corruption charges made against him, the
daily newspaper El Tlempo reported Sunday.
Citing results of a poll it commissioned last week, the Bogota newspaper said 57
percent of the people surveyed said they wanted Samper to withdraw from office
temporarily until a special congressional committee decided the merit of the
charges, which could eventually lead to his impeachment.

Press Release
It is SlU E’s version of Saturday Night Live or maybe
Nightline. No! Mass Communications students are not trying to
copy anyone’s program format. However, they’ve developed
their own television format with a quirky 15-minute program
called, “Square TV.”
The production will start by airing on the campus closedcircuit cable system and eventually expand into the
Edwardsville and Maryville cable systems. The cast and crew of
“Square TV ” are trying to get all SIUE students as well as area
communities involved through underwriting funds from SIUE
students, student organizations, community organizations, and
businesses. The underwriting will be used to cover the
production cost and equipment.
The initial airing of “Square TV” will be on Feb. 27 6
p.m.and 8 p.m. The cast and crew hope to air at least three
student videos every week as well as to expand the. length of
the show. AH SIUE students are welcome to submit video work
and story ideas.
For more information or to volunteer to help the “Square
TV” cast and crew contact Jeff Boulicault at (618) 692-2242 or
write to Boulicault at Box 1175 d o ITVA and “Square TV.”

Compensation: Time off v money
The 1938 Fair Labor Standard Act provides employees with the right
to earn time and a half in wages when they work overtime. It’s an act that
serves a good purpose.
But it may be time to amend that act. There is legislation in committee
with both the House and Senate that would provide more flexibility for
workers. The bills address the issue of compensatory time.
Many workers would rather be compensated in time off than in money
for overtime, but comp time is now limited. A worker can only take comp
time within the same work week that it is earned.
The bills currently in committee would allow workers to bank comp
time and take it later.
The concept is beneficial to both employers and employees. An
employer saves money by not having to dish out time and half in wages.
For employees, compensatory time offers flexibility to take an hour to two
off from work to take their children to the doctor, see a school play or for
other activities.
North Dakota Labor Commissioner Craig Hagen backs the plan and
labels it a mom-and-dad issue.
“That’s the voice that I try to get across—that this is not just an
employer-management side of the issue, this is a mom-and-dad, family
issue that Washington needs to recognize,” Hagen said.
The plan would call for a written agreement between employer and
employee that states the employee would like to use the comp time
option, strictly on a voluntary basis. There also would be a limit to the
amount of comp time an employee could bank.
Some organized labor groups oppose the bill, stating that comp time
would not be voluntary, but instead determined by employers.
In today’s world, where most families have both parents working,
compensatory time is a much-needed option. It’ll provide mom and dad
the opportunity to take an hour or two off from work when necessary and
it also provides employers with a way to save money, which means a lot in
the competitive business world.
Hagen says the bills will more than likely be reported out of committee
sometime this spring. H ere’s an early request that the House and Senate
take this bill seriously and provide workers with flexibility they can use.

Farmers have beef with Congress
Raising cattle in beef country makes for an independent, upright way
of life. Hard, but honest work. Right now people raising cattle don’t feel
they are getting an honest return for animals. That’s got ranchers angry
with the low prices that have livestock operations hurting.
Enough people agree so that Congress and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has begun to investigate.
But the way a 21-member USDA investigative committee is set up,
with only eight producers and none from North Dakota, gives cause to
question the quality of the result. More producers on the committee
would seem appropriate.
The crux of the cattle price issue:
The four largest packers slaughtered 82 percent of the animals in 1994,
compared with 36 percent in 1980.
Two years ago a 500-pound calf sold for $500, and right now that same
calf would bring $300.
The price of grain, needed to finish cattle for market, has steadily
increased in price.
The price of red meat in the grocer’s cold case has been stable, while
cattle prices have plummeted.
Ranchers are blaming depressed prices, in part, on the four companies
controlling the purchasing of animals for slaughter. But a recent
Agriculture Department study didn’t prove that depressed cattle prices
were intentionally created by the four largest companies.
Meat packers blame the low prices on a glut of cattle on the market.
The investigative committee, paying attention to producer complaints,
will hopefully take an honest look at the study and then determine if anti­
trust laws are being violated.
Ranchers deserve a straight answer on whether meat packers are
taking a lice of their profits.

B-2 Bomber on backburner
President Clinton made a gutsy decision recently when he stopped production of
the B-2 bomber program.
The decision took courage because this is an election year, not because the
cancellation will be criticized by America’s military brass or their supporters.
Clinton’s decision flew in the face of conventional wisdom that requires
incumbent candidates to dump huge piles of tax dollars into all the states where they
need votes in the next election.
In the case of the B-2, the controversial Stealth bombers are built in Southern
California by Northrop Grumman Corp. More than 9,000 workers are employed on
the B-2 project. But the number that incumbents look at is “54.” That’s the number
of electoral votes assigned to California—a treasure-trove of electoral votes for
presidential candidates.
Congressional Republicans figured they had a win-win idea for the Grand Old
Party when they added $493 million to this year’s defense budget to continue the
production of B-2 bombers. The way they figured it, California voters would be
grateful to the Republicans for the gift. And if Clinton axed the program, then
California voters would punish Clinton. And it may work out that way. But it
shouldn’t.
The Pentagon didn’t want the B-2 program to continue. The military brass didn’t
want the extra money to keep the program alive. The taxpayers already shelled out
$44 million for 20 B-2 bombers and military officials thought that was enough.
The $493 million added by the Republicans in this budget would eventually cost
taxpayers $30 billion to keep the production line running for the next two decades—
for something top military officials, including Defense Secretary William Perry and
Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, opposed.
Clinton can turn the trap planned for him to his advantage by chopping off other
election-year military and pork-barrel programs. The unneeded Seawolf submarine
program is another example of election-year pork designed to win votes in
Connecticut. Each Seawolf sub costs taxpayers about $2 billion even though the
subs are no longer needed to ensure future military readiness.
There are also all those military bases that the military and base closing
commissions have recommended closing as unneeded. But many bases are kept in
operation just to win votes to help political parties or individual politicians. If it’s
unneeded, it should go.

More military cuts during
post-C old War era
The recent announcement by Defense Secretary William Perry that more cuts in
the nation’s military reserve forces are scheduled for fiscal year 1996 represents
bitter but necessary medicine. Efficiency demands that military downsizing in the
post-Cold War era target units in both the reserves and the regular military.
Explaining the cuts does not render them any less painful for those serving in
superfluous units. The pending round of cutbacks—the third of five that are
scheduled—will affect nearly 16,000 Americans who serve in such units, or about 1.6
percent of the U.S. military’s reserve component.
Part-time military service in the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps is a
source of pride in the tradition of the civilian-soldier that extends back to
Revolutionary War days. But it also a means of augmenting civilian paychecks and
doing “something different.”
These considerations are important for individuals in the reserves, but the
Pentagon cannot be swayed by them, the two legitimate criteria are the usefulness
of reserve components in furthering a national military strategy in time of war, and
their usefulness in responding to critical domestic emergencies.
Sadly, no state is scheduled to take a bigger hit than Texas. Over the next seven
months, reserve units throughout the state are scheduled to lose 2,679 positions. At
the local level, the move will be keenly felt with the loss of the VMFA-124 fighter
attack squadron, a Marine unit, at the Dallas naval air station.
From a high of 1.2 million in 1989, the Pentagon plans to reduce reserve strength
to just over 950,000 by the end of 1999. That is obviously a reflection of post-Cold
War realities. Reasonable people may disagree over how fast the reduction should
occur, but a reduction is imperative.
As with the base closing issue, it is likely that new geopolitical and fiscal realities
will not prevent politicking against the cuts. But when all is said and done, the actual
need of the armed forces for critical missions abroad and at home must prevail over
purely political considerations.

Clark also instructed the young people in the
audience to remove the ‘toxic people’ from their
lives, and to persevere and be the best.
“You have Calvin Klein’s on your butts and
nothing in your minds. Take those science and math
courses. The best type of revenge is massive
success,” Clark explained.
He also answered several questions concerning

himself and some of the myths that have
surrounded him, as well as his views on the
education system.
“The bat is just a myth. I never carried a baseball
bat, only for the media. The m edia loves
charismatic people, and when they came to my
office to take a picture of me for Time magazine,
they told me to hold the bat, so I did,” Clark said.
A few weeks later, he said, he saw a copy of Time
magazine with his picture staring back at him
wielding a baseball bat. He said the image has
stayed with him ever since.
When asked by one of the members of the crowd
how he felt about the portrayal of himself in the
movie, Clark jokingly replied that the movie down
played him.

Clark also said that he feels that the government
needs to rethink the education model.
Public education, he explained, is braindead, and
he is convinced that there needs to be more schools
for parents to send their children to cause
competition in the education system.
“ If you have com petition, you have better
schooling,” Clark said.
Clark also added that it is time to crack down
and let all of the inner-city crime lords know that
the people of those communities say, no surrender.
The people in those communities have to bring
about the change or no change will occur, Clark
said.
While on campus, Clark also delivered a speech
to the Student Leadership Development Program
and talked to students from various area high
schools.

Kim, going on to explain that
“this sort of situation is an

days of the alleged incident.
From there, the complaint
will be investigated and dealt

the
sexual
harassment policy range from
a warning to suspension from
school (for students) or
suspension without pay (for
employees) to dismissal from
school or job.
In addition to defining
types of harassment and
punishment, the policy also
discusses appeal procedures,
sanctions,
retaliation,
confidentiality and frivolous
or malicious charges.
All employees of the

Josephine
Beckwith:
A role model

Josephine Beckwith's 80 years o f
contribu ting to her com m unity sets a
precedent for what it takes to become part
of Black History.
"Black H istory Personified" is an
appropriate handle for this dynamic Alton
resident and SIUE graduate. Through
dozens of clubs, professional organizations
and self-made opportunities, she has
contributed thousands o f hours toward
helping
blacks
realize
both
their
importance and potential.
"Josephine has always been a positive
force for the recognition of blacks in history
and especially for the contributions o f all
blacks in this area," said Beckwith's cousin,
Charlotte Johnson.
"I've met many people w ho say that
Beckwith has been their 'un official' mentor
and that she's helped them in so many
ways."
According to Webster's dictionary, a
person must do something significant
(caused by something other than mere
chance) to affect a nation or institutions in
order to make history. Beckwith has passed
this criteria many times over.
She has been purposely affecting
institutions all o f her life w ith her strong
convictions,
peaceful
manner
and
fearlessness in fighting injustice. These
qualities have helped her create change
w ith in her com m unities' w ork force,
educational, home, church and social
structures.
Changes started during high school in
East St. Louis where black students were
required to w alk across tow n to participate
in sports and domestic science classes. She (Top) Josephine Beckwith, Black Pioneer founding committee member, tells visitors how unique designs and stitchwork on handmade

never made to do household chores during school.
The injustice o f separate classes was part o f the issue, but Beckwith said that
"M y sister and I never had to do dishes or any of the chores when we were
she never did take home economic type courses in school. Her father had deeper
going to school. M y father did them and told us to just 'Get away' and 'Go do
your homework," Beckwith said.
That attitude, combined w ith her mother's practice of tending babies and
household chores w hile requiring Beckwith to read the daily newspaper
headlines out loud, helped create a deep respect for fam ily and education.
More reinforcement about broadening educational horizons came once the
chores were done at her house. The fam ily often went into St. Louis to the art
museum, opera or other desegregated cultural affairs for entertainment.
"Josephine had been a role model for many people," said Charlene G ill,
president emeritus of the Alton Museum o f History and Art.
"I admire her for demonstrating the courage of her convictions.
"She is one who actively sat-in at the segregated Grand Theater in Alton when
they raised the house lights and tried to make her leave," G ill said.
According to Johnson, the 1950s was a time when many theater owners said
that you had to go up the outside stairs to get into the theater and take your own
popcorn w ith you.
"She (Beckwith) knew it was wrong to have to pay the same money to get in
and not be able to sit where you wanted."
Through the years, Beckwith was involved w ith various committees formed to
bring change to her community. After working on a bond issue to make possible
a new junior high school in town, she was greatly disappointed, yet not
surprised, to have her own children ostracized from attending.
Her face knotted into a serious frown when questioned about how she
handled that injustice. She said, "One of the things I could never understand was
that the high school, built on that same property, was not segregated. The (junior
high) sit-in's were just too rough to talk about."

Role model_____________________________________________
from page 8
Putting pressure on the injustices of the academic com m unity brought her into the forefront of
creating a kindergarten for black children in the Alton Public Schools. When told the board of
education couldn't find a 'qualified' teacher, Beckwith called upon her sister, Naomi Marley, who
lived in Washington, D.C., to fill the position and right the wrong.
She was also instrumental in using her position as a Parent -Teacher Association member to
help get equal equipment like new textbooks and cooking facilities for the blacks' school
buildings.
"Used books all the tim e gets into your child's everything. This kind of thing reaches right down
into the very soul of a c h ild /' she said.
When she moved to Alton after marrying her first husband soon after high school, she came to
realize that she had disappointed her father. He fu lly expected his children to go to college and,
"Papa actually came up here once to try and bribe my husband and me to go to college," she
said.
She had taken college courses during high school, "Something that's not so new as most people
w ould think," she said. But her father's offer offended her because she felt that she already had
the greatest job on earth, at least that is what she tried to tell herself.
"I always had this nagging feeling that going to school would be too selfish, depriving my
fam ily o f the best they could get from me as a mother and a w ife," she said.
She felt that her parents' marriage breakup had something to do with her attitude about family,
but no matter what importance she placed on raising her family, she always recognized the need
to learn and take college courses.
However, it took her several years to get smart enough to take the courses for credit instead of
non-credit. "I've never told a living soul this before, I can tell my age and other things, but this is
real hard for me to say.
"Uhhh, I'm sure, let me see now, it took me at least 15 years to finally get through college. I
felt so ashamed about it that when it came time to graduate I never paid the money and stayed
home and did my laundry that night."
She said that getting her speech com munication and business degree saved and changed her
life quite comfortably. "It has helped immeasurably in training others."
More change came to Beckwith's com m unity when she became involved in an NAACP project
to help get blacks jobs during W orld War II. Times were hard and the bitter pill of segregation kept
her own husband from finding training or employment. They both agreed to reach out to others
in the com m unity w ho had similar needs.
"For me, desegregation was based on the premise that bad behavior is caused by ignorance
and a desire for power."
Bondage in the workplace was pulled to its knees when Beckwith used the fam ily car to drive
people to a local corporation where they stood in line day after day after day seeking
employment. She helped corporate officials become aware of their plight.
"Finally, one day the head personnel man came outside and waved an application in my face
accusing me of being to afraid to apply for a job myself," she said. "I filled it out on the spot and
the very next morning, early, the head o f the employment office, representing (that corporation)
was standing at my front door."
"That's how I got my first jo b ," she said. "It was a case of being w illin g to be used for (that
corporation's) purposes in order to get my purpose (of desegregation) met."
Beckwith stayed busy w orking and raising her five children but still reached out to the
com m unity as she saw a need. She served as one of the original 50 members o f a committee
which determined the fate of old Shurtleff College. As one o f tw o blacks on that committee, she
stood for keeping the school operational and expanding its influence.
W ith this committee, SIU was born and in 1962 Beckwith was employed by the graphics art
department beginning a long, productive period w orking various campus jobs.
"It was during this time that they actually allowed us one hour of work time that we could use
toward taking classes at SIU," she said. Adding a second class was helpful in reaching her degree
goal, but working, keeping house, doing homework, caring for a grade-schooler and driving back
and forth to classes took its toll on her time.
Johnson recalled that even w ith this hectic schedule Beckwith still helped others. "It was during
the '70s and '80s that she worked at SIU and helped many students stay in school, study and
increase their self esteem.
"Josephine actually took students home and fed them, mothered them and gave them that extra
push in life that they needed," she said.
When Beckwith was 11-years-old she turned her life over to Jesus and from then on was freed
from a deeply-rooted fear about the w orld ending. Having experienced change in the foundations
of her own 'institution' she began to let both courage and teaching Sunday School under gird her
activities. Through this teaching position she eventually touched many lives.
Assistant State's Attorney Duane Bailey was one of her students and said that Beckwith has
known him all o f his life. "She was very good at helping us to know the importance of our national
black culture that was not available to us coming up through school. She introduced us to Ralph
Bunche, Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen and other black artists and musicians.
"She also brought us into a perspective of Alton, III. and helped us understand the successes
and sacrifices made by local people for us.
"There was a time when we couldn't even play in the school band or in the athletic programs
here," he said.
Bailey internalized Beckwith's lessons and today credits her, his father and others in helping
him to reach out and serve his community. Besides serving in his statewide legal capacity, he is
the Chairman o f the Board for the Madison County Urban League w hich helps solve problems in
housing, employment and health concerns.
Beckwith's leap over the chasm of ignorance and hatred has earned for her an official place in
the annals o f local black history. Her significant contributions and those of other area blacks are
featured in the Black Pioneer Exhibits at the Alton Museum of History and Art located in Loomis
Hall on the SlU-Alton Dental School campus.

Jackie Chan
is the Man..
By Lenon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
Are you a fan of action pictures?
Are you all set to see the next “Under
Siege” movie, (if there is one)? Are
you first in line for a new Jean-Claude
Van Damme film? If you answered
yes to any of these questions, then
Rumble in the Bronx'is a movie for
you. Once you see it, you’ll never look
at other action movie stars again
because you’ll be a Jackie Chan fan.
For those who don’t know, Jackie
Chan is a Chinese film star of epic
proportions. He is so big that there is
no one comparable in the U.S. (His
picture is placed on the front page of
schoolbooks in China to serve as a
role model for children.) He currently
has three films in release in his own
country, and numerous female fans
attempted suicide when a newspaper
reported that he had a new girlfriend.
Chan is popular for two reasons.
One reason is his comedic acting that
brings a sense of light-heartedness to
his pictures. Many people have said
that he is the Buster Keaton of
martial arts films. The fight scenes are
fun because of his physical comedy.
The other reason is the fact that he
does all of his own stunts. No stunt
men or stunt doubles for him. Every
fall, leap, punch, kick, and flip is Chan
himself. During his career, he has
broken many bones in his body and

...a n d

has come close to death at least once.
Chan was filming for the movie
The Arm our o f God in 1985 when he
landed on his head and came close to
ending his life. The stunt required him
to jump from a hill to a tree that
would bend with his weight and bring
him safely to the ground. Chan didn’t
like the way he landed the first time,
so he decided to try again. On the
second attempt, the tree snapped,
resulting in a fall of almost 45 feet.
Chan landed on his head, and luckily
survived. Eleven years later, he still
has a hole in his skull from the fall.
In Rumble, Chan is a man named
Kjeung visiting from Hong Kong to
attend his Uncle’s wedding. His uncle
owns a store in the Bronx and is
getting ready to sell it so he can retire
with his new wife. The uncle sells the
store to a young woman, who recruits
Kjeung to stay and help her run
things. He has a run-in with a local
gang and spends most of the movie
dealing/fighting with them.
While running around, he also gets
involved with a mafia boss looking for
his stolen diamonds. The diamonds
have been unknowingly hidden in the
seat cushion of a wheel chair
belonging to Kjeung’s neighbor.
Once the picture ends, he has
befriended the gang members, (who
by this time have decided crime is
bad), and caught the mafia guys.
The plot is average, nothing special.

A d am

The stunts,
however, are
very special.
There are things
that Chan does
during the fight
scenes that
almost
make you
laugh. It
is hard
to
believe
that
the

things
he does
are
possible,
but they
are. He
springs
through
shopping
carts, leaps
trom one building to
another, and jumps onto a
hover craft from a nearby
bridge.
In the stunt with the hover
craft, he broke his ankle. They still
used it in the movie, though. (If
you watch closely, you can actually
see the ankle start to turn.) Chan

Assistant Lifestyle Editor
Happy Gilmore is not just our
Editor-in-Chiefs new nickname. It’s
the latest film effort from former
Saturday Night Live crack-up and
“They’re All Gonna Laugh At You”
mastermind Adam Sandler, and I can
honestly say that I’ve never laughed so
hard.
Gilmore is an uncoordinated
hockey wanna-be who just happens to
have an incredible slapshot on the golf
course. He is talked into competing for
a spot on the Pro-Tour by a retired golf
pro who is affectionately referred to as
Chubbs after Chubbs witnesses him
driving a golf ball over 400 yards.
Gilmore, who had to put his
grandmother in a nursing home after
she lost her house for not having paid
$270,000.00 in back taxes, agrees to
give it a try in order to win the money
to get his sweet Granny’s house back.
Once on the tour, the hockey player
in Gilmore becomes apparent as he

always puts in outtakes of
botched stunts at the end of
nis movies, so you can see him
beine taken off on a
stretcher or catching
punch
in
the

nose.
The most impressive display
physical dexterity is when Chan
rolls from his back into a
handstand, and then starts to
do push-ups while he still
balances himself upsidedown. Absolutely
incredible .
Hopefully Chan will
make many more movies
before he retires, because his body
won’t be able to take the abuse
forever. If you see Rumble in the
Bronx and like it, go to the
video store and get Drunken
Master, Super Cop, or any
other of his later pictures
because they just give more
examples of why he is the highest
grossing movie star in the world.
To put it simply, Jackie Chan is the
man!

u p to

p ar

throws his clubs, screams obscenities
on live television and gets in a butt
kicking contest with “Price is Right”
star Bob Barker (Barker whipped up
on him pretty well).
Sandler’s main golf rival, Shooter
McGavin, futilely tries to get Gilmore
bum ped off the tour and almost
succeeds when a steel television tower
clobbers him, but this is the movies,
people! Gilmore wins the money, gets
a coveted pro-tour gold jacket, and
gets his Granny’s house back.
Other than the predictable ending,
this movie was full of “what can he
possibly do next?” I think Sandler
took attitude lessons from Tony Twist
while preparing for this role, because
his character fought more than he
played in this movie.
However,
this—along
with
Gilmore’s hockey jersey and sweats
golf outfit—added an interesting angle
to the otherwise calm world of golf.
Watching him get the bejeebers
knocked out of him by Bob Barker
was well worth the price of admission.

Kentucky not friendly place for Cougars to visit
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor

Jeremy Paschall/A/esf/e

Ronnie Henderson grabs a rebound in a recent Cougar game.
The Cougars w ill finish their season with two games this week.

Basketball games can be won with a good
inside attack, or with quality outside shooting.
The SIUE men’s basketball team experienced
defeat to one of each of the approaches on
their road trip through Kentucky.
Thursday, N orthern Kentucky used an
outside attack to beat the Cougars 96-73, and
Saturday, Bellarmine used power under the
basket to register a 101-93 win.
In Thursday’s contest, the Cougars played a
zone defense in the first half that led to a
barrage of three pointers from the normally
bad shooting Norse.
“The first three shots they took were threes
to put them up 9-0,” head coach Jack
Margenthaler said Monday afternoon. “From
that point we kind of lost our confidence and
aggressiveness.”
The loss of aggressiveness and continued
hot shooting from NKU led to a 55-29 halftime
deficit for the Cougars. All tolled, the Norse
were 10-of-14 from behind the arc in the first
half.
“It was just a great three-point night for
them,” Margenthaler said.
In the second half, the Cougars got their
aggressiveness back and outscored NKU by
three, but it was too little, too late.
The Cougar attack was led by Jason Holmes
with 16 points. He was followed by Ronnie

Henderson and Chris Harris with 14 apiece,
while Tim Holloway finished with 12 and
Nathan Kreke tallied 10.
Two nights later, the Cougars travelled to
Louisville for the match-up with Bellarmine
and the GLVC’s leading scorer Steve Mercer.
Bellarmine used the inside attack of the 6foot-7 Mercer and 6-foot-5 Frankie Moore to
earn the eight-point victory.
M ercer finished with 38 points and 11
rebounds and Moore had 28 points for the
Knights.
“We knew Mercer was going to get his
points, but Moore was the problem. He killed
us,” M argenthaler said.
Shaun Smoot led the Cougars with 20 points
as the Knights did an effective job of shutting
down Holmes, who finished with 12 points
while only taking eight shots. Harris and
Henderson also reached double figures with 18
and 16 points respectively.
M argenthaler said the game was a fastpaced one and Smoot thrives in the open court.
M argenthaler was also pleased with Smoot’s
10-of-12 performance from the foul line.
The Cougars now take their 9-14 overall
record and 6-12 GLVC record into the final
week of the season and home games against St.
Joseph’s and IUPU-Ft. Wayne.
M argenthaler knows what he is looking for
out of his team in the final games.
“Simply—two wins,” he said.

SIUE students do well Lady Cougars struggle on the roadat ACUI regional event look to end season on a good note
By UC Recreation
Shelly Goleanor won both the Association of College
Unions International (ACUI) individual all-events and
Bowl USA the past weekend, Feb. 24 and 25.
Goleanor, a sophomore, defeated 58 other female
bowlers from schools through Illinois and Indiana.
Goleanor advances to both the ACUI nationals held in
Atlanta and Bowl USA state finals held in Chicago later
this spring.
Goleanor led the nine game event from start to finish,
but had to ward off a late charge from Estella Artiaga of
Illinois State whose eight game pin total equaled
Goleanor. Goleanor finished her ninth game with a 192
to A rtiaga’s 182. G oleanor averaged 198 on the
University of Illinois lanes.
On the men's side, Phil Barry, another sophomore,
also won a spot to bowl in the state finals of Bowl USA,
and finished eleventh overall out of 95 male competitors.
Barry’s nine game total of 1944 (216 average) included a
280 game.
Senior Dave Weber struggled through the first three
games, but roared back in the final block. Weber’s 757
won the ACUI m en’s individual title for best series in the
final three games. Other male bowlers were Bobby
Bonds, Charlie Churchill, Jay Mendell and Joe Sopiars.
The m en’s team finished seventh of 14 teams.
Billiard players fared well, too. Sheree Volrab, a
senior, finished third of 11 female players. John Bukovac
competed play tied for 5th in a field of forty males.
ACUI regional participants are selected in late
January by winning the campus tournament for their
respective events. The ACUI is a professional
organization to which the SIUE University'Center is a
member. The University Center Recreation will host
the 1997 regional as part of the U C’s 30th anniversary
celebration.

This weekend was a tough one for the
SIUE women’s basketball team. They lost a
pair of out of town games starting with a 62-50
loss to Northern Kentucky. Then top rated
Bellarmine handed the Lady Cougars their
second setback of the weekend with a 93-55
beating.
Thursday’s contest against N orthern
Kentucky saw senior guard Terri Evans
contribute 19 points to an otherwise
disappointing team performance. The Cougars
shot 5 for 23 in the second half after only being
down two at half time.
“It was a hard-fought game,” head coach
Wendy Hedberg said, “but our shooting went
cold.”
On Saturday night, the Cougars were
looking to upset the number one team in the
Great Lakes Valley Conference. Bellarmine
was 17-2 in the conference and, by the end of
the game, added to that impressive record with
a 38-point victory.
Sophomore Alicia Harkins and Evans led
the Lady Cougars with 17 and 13 points
respectively.
“We just couldn’t get going, and they were
