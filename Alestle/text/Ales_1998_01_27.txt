NEWS REPORTER

St. Louis Post-Dispatch columnist,
Gregory Freeman cited racial polarization
as the biggest problem communities face
today when he gave the keynote speech at
T hursday’s M artin L uther King, Jr.
Birthday Celebration Luncheon.
“We m ust see how polarization
affects us politically, economically and
morally,” Freem an said. “We need to
reach out more to do what we can in our
own spheres of influence.”
Freeman challenged those present to
take the initiative to end polarization o f all
minorities because “we will never be all
we can be unless we learn to be all we can
be together,” he said.
see SPEAKERS, page 2

A passion for justice and the hope of a
united America brought attorney Morris
Dees to the SIUE campus on Jan. 22, to
speak to students and the community in
celebration o f M artin Luther King, Jr. day.
“We need to decrease the temperature
on racial issues and find a way to label
ourselves ‘Americans of mixed descent,” ’
Dees said. “Race is an artificial concept
that means nothing genetically.”
In 1971, Dees co-founded the
Southern Poverty Law Center dedicated to
the pursuit o f equal opportunities for
minorities and the poor. In 1981, Dees
began a battle against hate groups that

1RS offers electric filing as alternative to traditional filing
■ BY ZHANDA
JOHNSON
NEW S EDITOR
Does the date April 15th
ring a bell? It is a date which
many people despise because it
is the income tax deadline. For
those who feel this way, there is
a fairly new way o f filing taxes
which could m ake filing easier.

This year choose a different
way o f filing your income tax
return. The Internal Revenue
Service offers several electronic
filing (IRS e-file) options for
individual taxpayers. Last year
over 19 m illion taxpayers chose
an e-file option.
O ne
of
the
biggest
p ro fessional

return
p rep aratio n com panies, H&R

B lock supports the e-file
system.
“We like electronic filing
because the IRS likes it,” Carol
Augustine, office supervisor of
the Edw ardsville office said.
Augustine said that if H&R
Block prepares a tax return they
will e-file it for free.
Federal tax returns can be
e-filed through an approved

electronic filer. In order to do
this one should look for the
“A uthorized
IRS
e-file
Provider sign. The com pleted
return is transm itted, usually for
a charge, over telephone lines
directly to IRS computers.
Illinois residents can e-file
their state and federal income
tax return in one transm ission to
the
IRS.
The
Illinois

D epartm ent o f R evenue will
retrieve the inform ation it needs
to
process
the
return
electronically.
For those who ow n a
personal com puter, some on­
line com puter service providers
offer e-file for a small fee. All a
person needs is a modem and
1RS accepted software.

Latex is the safe sex condom
Misconceptions and improper condom use
could heighten STD risk for SIUE students
■ BY RENEE HOLLER
NEWS STRINGER
Now more than ever, SIUE
students need to be aware that
condom
use
dram atically
reduces the transm ission of
sexually transm itted diseases
(STDs). A ccording to Dr. Lee
Johnson, d irecto r o f H ealth
Services at SIUE, a reason to
be concerned is the rapid
increase o f several STDs.
“It
(the
m ajor

m isconceptions students have)
is that they are not going to get
it (an ST D ),” Johnson said.
A ccording to Johnson, many
young people also believe that
if the fem ale is using another
form o f birth control (such as
birth control pills or Norplant),
they
are protected
from
sexually transm itted diseases
as well as pregnancy. Nothing
could be further from the truth.

disagrees.

US government should repeal the Hatch Act of 1939 and
give government employees a chance at civic involvement
Shortly after filing a Democrat primary petition for the
Illinois Twentieth Congressional District, David Loebach
was inform ed that he was not eligible to be a
congressional candidate. Loebach, an employee of the
Illinois Department of Human Services, has discovered
that his job may be covered under Title 5 o f the United
States Code, chapter 15, paragraph 1501. Commonly
referred to as the Hatch Act of 1939, this law regulates
which state or local government employees may run for
partisan political office.
Paragraphs 1501 and 1502 of the act state that a state
or local officer or employee whose principal employment
is in connection with activity which is financed in whole
or in part by loans or grants made by the United States or
a federal agency may not (1) use his official authority or
influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting
the result o f an election or a nomination for office; (2)
directly or indirectly coerce, attempt to coerce, command
or advise a state or local officer or employee to pay, lend
or contribute anything of value to a party, committee,
organization, agency or person for political purposes; or
(3) be a candidate for elective office. These officers and
employees retain the right to vote and to express opinions
on political subjects and candidates. The act does not
prohibit the people specified in the act from being a
candidate in a non-partisan election.
The act does not apply to the Governor, Lieutenant
Governor or individuals authorized by law to act as
Governor; the M ayor of a city; a duly elected head of an
executive department of a state or municipality who is not
classified under a state or municipal merit o f civil service
system; or an individual holding elective office.

The Office of Special Counsel was established in 1989
as an independent agency within the executive branch of
the federal government. It has been designated as the
agency which will investigate the provisions of this act. If,
after receiving a creditable report of a violation o f the act,
the special counsel shall investigate and present its
finding to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).
The MSPB will set a hearing date and notify the officer or
employee. At that hearing the MSPB will determine if
there was a violation of the act, determine whether the
violation warrants the removal of the officer or employee
from the office or employment, and will notify the
individual and the agency of its decision by mail.
If the Merit Systems Protection Board orders the
removal of an officer or employee and finds that after 30
days that individual has not been removed or has been
removed and rehired in less than 18 months by the state in
a state or local agency which does not receive loans or
grants from a federal agency, the MSPB will take action
to cause the appropriate federal agency to withhold from
its loans or grants to the state or local agency, to which
notice was given, an amount equal to two years pay at the
rate the officer or employee was receiving at the time of
the violation. O f course the act also provides for appeal to
the courts.
David Loebach may or may not be a credible candidate
for Congress. Yet, if the Office of Special Counsel
determ ines that the Illinois D epartm ent o f Human
Services receives federal funds, Mr. Loebach will not be
permitted to be a candidate.
State and local government employ vast armies of
workers

like Mr. Loebach. Many of their executive agencies
receive federal funds. By taking those funds, governments
also agree to take from their employees a portion of their
political rights. There are num erous reasons why
Congress passed the Hatch Act in 1939. Yet, one must
inquire about the fairness of a system which prevents
otherwise qualified citizens from running for political
office. The U.S. C onstitution clearly defines the
qualifications to be a candidate for federal office. There is
no mention of an exclusion for those who work for a state
or local government agency which receives federal grants
or loans. Mr. Loebach may be struck from his
Congressional ballot contention through no fault of his
own. Rather, it may be a result of an omnipresent federal
government.
Just because the federal government sends grants or
loans to a state or a local agency it should not
automatically disqualify an entire class of otherwise
qualified citizens from seeking political office. There may
have been some good political reasons in 1939 but are
those reasons still valid in 1998? L et’s see some
statesmanship, for a change.
Congress should revisit that portion of the Hatch Act of
1939 which excludes an entire class of citizens from their
right to be a candidate for any partisan political office,
m unicipal, state or federal. They should consider
modifying or repealing Paragraph 1502 (a) (3); be a
candidate for elective office.

In the Jan. 22, 1998 issue o f the Alestle, a photo on page 5 stated
that the Edwardsville amphitheater was being built, when in fact it
is still in an approval phase. Also, in the article “Belton named
Alestle editor in chief,” Danielle Belton was approved by the
Student Publications Advisory Board. Also, the date on the front
page read 1997 when it should have read 1998. The Alestle
apologizes for these errors.

e-filing one transmits the return
to the on-line service. The

then sent to the 1RS. The 1RS will
then notify the person through the
on-line service whether or not
the return has been accepted. If it
is not accepted the person will
be told w hich item s have to

from page 3
“In an age increasingly populated by militia groups
that train to com m it violence, states should
seriously think about using their anti-militia laws to
shut down militias ... they are the best route to
prevent the violence that militias cause before it
occurs.” Illinois has an anti-m ilitia law, but
Missouri does not.
Another arm of the Southern Poverty Law
Center is its Teaching Tolerance program begun in
1991 as a response to an increase in hate crimes
among youths. The program offers free or low-cost
resources to educators at all levels. Curriculum
resources include the free video and text teaching
kits, A m erica’s Civil Rights M ovement and The
Shadow of Hate, which chronicle the history of
hatred and intolerance in American and the struggle
to overcome prejudice. One of the films produced
by Teaching Tolerance, A Time for Justice, won an
A cadem y Award in 1995 for Best Short
Documentary.
Dees has received many awards for his work at
the Southern Poverty Law Center. In 1987, Dees
was named Trial Lawyer of the Year by Trial
Lawyers for Public Justice, and he received the
Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Award from the
National Education Association in 1990.
In the 1996 feature film about the murder of
civil rights leader M edgar Evers, G hosts of
Mississippi, Dees was portrayed by actor Wayne
Rogers.

I hate to complain, but I have
come to a disheartening
realization. There is no such
thing as originality anymore.
I wracked my brain, and I
can’t think of a concept or
person that is doing something
entirely new. Everything is
either a remake or an homage.
Usually anything written about a
new idea has a comparison to an
old idea.
Sure some might say, “Well,
that’s not so bad.” And, they’re
right. This gives younger people
a chance to discover things that
their elder generations have
already enjoyed.
The disheartening thing is that
some people are so deluded that
they think what they are doing is
new and cutting edge.
Let’s start with sex. Now,
anything having to do with sex,
be it with a man and a woman, a
man and a man, a woman and a
woman, or a man with a dog, has
been done.
It had probably been done in
the first 50 years of m an’s
existence on earth. And, no
m atter what your religious
beliefs, that was a long time ago.
So, anyone who thinks
they’re conquering new ground
by using some new and painful
position or implement of
penetration is just going to extra
effort for nothing. Neil
Armstrong w on’t be calling to
congratulate you. (In fact, they
probably messed around on the
moon, just to do something
different.)
So, it’s okay to accept that
what you do everyday is already
old hat, but it’s not okay to give
up. I do not want to see anymore
sad excuses from those in the
entertainment industry who do
not even attempt an original
thought. No more remakes of
60s cartoons or TV shows! And
please, for the love o f all that is
sacred, no more cheap Puff
Daddy song remakes. It’s called
pumped-up muzak, Puffy, and
it stinks!

hey starred
on
the
M T V
1 k e t c h
comedy
show “The
State” for
“about ten
minutes”
and
now
K e r r i
Kenney,
Tom Lennon and M ichael Ian Black are
living large on Comedy Central in the big
and brassy “Viva Variety.”
“Viva” is a parody of
Europeon variety show s,
such
as
“El
Sabado
Gigante,” which are bigger
than
life
and
feature
eccentric guests. Now in its
second season, “Viva” will
feature guest stars like
D avid
Johansen,
Evil
Knievel and Reel Big Fish.
The show ’s incarnation
began from a skit from “The
State” written by Lennon.
“It was very, very unlike
the show now,” Lennon said.
“We had people screaming,
an ape man, a H itler
character, talking cuckoo
a p clock. In short, it was very
*•’ annoying.”
The trio, along with co­
creator Ben Garant, toned
the show dow n, and it
became more for adults by
the time it aired on Comedy
Central.
The show gets written
by Lennon, B lack and
Garant. Lennon said they
had a very successful writing process.
“Basically, me and Mike and Ben sit in
a room,” he said. “Mike and I have
computers and Ben writes longhand like
M ozart.”
“And, we play with the putting machine
we have and we dunk baskets and we try
to think of jokes. I t’s a really nice
process, because we have w orked
together for so long that we have a really
good sense on how the others write,”
Lennon said.
“They hand me a script and it’s as if I
had written it,” Kenney concurred. “We
trust each other and we speak the same
language.”
The show stars Lennon and Kenney as
Mr. and the former Mrs. Laupin, an exhusband and wife team still working
together after divorce. They riff off each
other like a super-demented Sonny and
Cher. Their companion is the clueless
Johnny Blue Jeans, who attempts to be
the epitome of American cool, but acts
m ore like Fonzie with a learning
disability. All three speak with an
indeterminable European accent.
Kerrey attempted to explain where the

r

T h e

A l e s i l e

origin of the accents came from.
“I don’t know if you can print this, but
out of my ass,” she said. “Basically, Tom
and I, for the last 12 years have been doing
this voice that we used to call the nowhere
people. It was a character where you
couldn’t identify where they had come
from. That was our little joke and we made
it into a big TV show,” Kenney said.
One of the big differences between
“Viva” and “The State” is the addition of
celebrity guests to aid the variety show
form at. W orking with celebrities have
caused Lennon and Kenney to get a little
star-struck.
“I’m always interested in people who
scared me as a child, and I was always
afraid of Stacy Keach,” Lennon said. “I
was also very scared of Fishbone... But, it
turned out they were very mellow.”
Kenney, Lennon and Black have
worked together for a decade, but have led
very interesting lives without the other
members being involved.
Kenney’s father is also involved in
show business. He is the voice for such
popular anim ated breakfast cereal
characters as the Cocoa Puffs bird and
Count Chocula.
Kenney is also the lead singer and bass
player for the band Cake Like. The band is
currently writing their second album, but
have been plagued by ill health. Kenney
herself is recovering from work overload.
“I do too much,” Kenney said. “It
should always be a lesson to me because
every time I do too much I get sick and end
up in the hospital. And I don’t learn and I
push on and it
happens again.
So, this time
I ’m trying to
remember that,
even though I
w on’t.”
She has also
starred in a film
that com peted
in
the
Sundance film
festival
last
year
called
“Love God.”
“I
play
D arla,
a
surrogate sex
therapist
in
training, which
is her way of
having sex with
all the patients
and
getting
away with it,”
Kenney said.

money to go and see the country, and I
thought it was a good idea,” Black said.
“It was a lot of working with latex and
saying ‘Cowabunga’ a lot. Surprisingly
little martial arts involved. I was Raphael,
occasionally D onatello, but I really
connected with Raphael.”
Black, along with another “State” vet
Michael Showalter, hosts a weekly night
of alternative comedy called “Stella.” The
show is very popular in New York City
and has featured comedians like Jeneane
Garofolo and odder acts like a puppet
show. The show has an open format in
which com ics can perform sketches,
m onologues or regular stand-up for a
mature audience.
“The com ics appreciate [“Stella”]
because they can get laughs that they
might not get in other clubs,” Black said.
Lennon is using his time on hiatus from
“Viva” to write jokes for another Comedy
Central show called “Pulp Comics.”
The foursom e o f Black, Lennon,
Kenney and Grant, along with the other six
members of “The State”, became friends
and a team when they were all going to
NYU. The group somewhat disbanded
after being cancelled by MTV and a veryshort lived appearance on CBS.
Lennon is surprised at “The States”
popularity after its cancellation.
‘“ The State’ was the most hated show
in the history o f television. We got
negative three stars from the New York
Post ... There were two girls, they were
kind of looking at me, and I thought they

recognized me from the show. I got ten
feet past them and they yelled ‘We
hate you!’ They were mustering up the
courage to tell me that they hated me,”
Lennon said.
Besides the show, the troupe wrote a
comical guide to the United States, which
was also not very well received.
“ ‘Entertainm ent W eekly’ called it
racist,” said Black. “If I had wanted the
book to be racist, you would know. I
would have fought tooth and nail for it. It
would be my version and published by the
W hite Aryan Press,” Black said.
All joking aside, the luck of ‘The State’
has been low as of late.They recorded an
album which was never released, and
Kenney said they made a bad decision
w hich cost them a m ovie deal. Still
though, Kenney and Black are hopeful
about the future of “The State.”
“The State as an entity still exists. It’s
just in hiatus because no one wants to give
us money,” Black said.
“We have reached cult status,” Kenney
said. “There’s no question in my mind that
we always will work together in one form
or another. It was bizzare that we ever got
together in the first place, but we got
together for a reason. I could tell a psychic
that and if they tell me otherwise I’d tell
them to shove it.”
O f course, Lennon has another opinion.
“Maybe in a few years, I’ll miss it when a
couple o f them start dropping dead,”
he said.

Left Bank Books:
A nook for book
lovers and coffee
drinkers
■ BY STEPHEN WHITE
LIFESTYLE REPORTER
There’s a little bookstore and
cafe in the St. Louis Central West
End; a place where book lovers
can meet some of the biggest
names in literature today.
Left Bank Books and Cafe
Danielle are connected from the
inside by an open door. The cafe
houses book signings, reading
discussion groups and several
special events.
Last W ednesday, N ational
Book Award finalist Amy Bloom
debuted her first novel, Love
Invents Us at the historic book
store and cafe. H er work has
appeared in the New Yorker, the
1991 and 1992 Best American
Short Story collections and the
1994 O. Henry Prize Story
collection. She is also the author
o f Come to Me, a collection of
short stories and writes a column
for a new magazine for women,

entitled “Sex Life.”
Bloom
is
a
psychotherapist by trade and
lives in Connecticut. She
read a chapter from Love.
Invents Us and a short story
entitled “The Gates Are
C losing,” which will be
published in the February
edition of “Z oetrope,” a
m agazine
produced
by
Francis Ford Coppola.
She spoke directly and
w ith
authority,
seldom
pausing as she read line after
line of her rich, vivid prose.
The audience of no more than 50,
composed primarily of women,
giggled ferociously when Bloom
told jokes and whined and
moaned in empathetic “mms” and
“uh huhs” during her moments of
greatest insight. Her stories dealt
with the problems o f growing up
as a fem ale in contem porary
society.
A fter the readings, she

answ ered questions from the
audience and signed books for
her fans.
Barry Leibman, owner of Left
Bank Books, said Bloom’s visit
continued the tradition of great
writers who have chosen the
vintage St. Louis book store to
debut their newest works.
“W e’ve had hundreds of
writers come through our doors,
many of them m ajor literary
figures of today,” Leibman
said. “People like William
Burroughs, Toni Morrison
and Charles Johnson, to
name a few.”
Left
Bank
Books
sponsors about 10 literary
events each month. The
store is a 3,000 square-foot,
two-story building which
was erected around the time
o f the W orld’s Fair. It
opened in 1969. Leibman
and his co-owners took it
over in 1977. Presently,
only
10 w orkers are
employed. The store is
strapped for help, but they
cannot afford to hire any
new employees. They are
losing ground due to
com petition
from
superstores like Barnes and
Noble and subsidiaries.
“The most significant
thing about us right now is
that we are the last
independent, full-service,
full-selection book store
left in the m etropolitan
area,”
Leibm an
said.
“There’s one book store in

Kansas City like us, but the rest
have been taken over by
superstores — superstores that
pretty much run everybody else
out of business.”
Left Bank Books doesn’t sell a
book simply because it’s a New
York Times bestseller. “This is
really a literary bookstore,” he
said. “We specialize in fiction,
art, psychology and politics. We
also have a used book section
dow nstairs which em phasizes
literature and the arts. W e’re
pretty choosy in what we carry.
For instance, we don’t have
romances or westerns. For the
amount of space we have, we try
to put in it what w e’re most
interested in. T h at’s why an
independent
bookstore
is
different than a chain bookstore.
First o f all, you don’t have as
much space. And secondly, you
have an identity as opposed to
ju st
being
another
book
warehouse.”
An identity that employees
like Sharon Greenwood, 35, take
pride in being a part of. “We have
a lot of regular customers here.
It’s pretty much a neighborhood
store,” she said. “The coffee shop
next door helps a lot. We get
some of the same people in here
every morning. This store has a
lot of personality. I’ve worked at
a lot of different bookstores and
to be honest, right now I’m
exactly where I want to be.”
W hereas a chain bookstore
might hire someone whose only
reading interests include comic
books and magazines, Left Bank

Books
hires
only
true
bookworms. “You have to love
books to work at a store like this,”
Greenwood said.
The store’s distinctive identity
is in large part due to its founding
fathers’ original political agenda.
The name “Left Bank Books”
definitely implies a left-wing,
liberal affiliation. In other words,
don’t expect William F. Buckley
or Rush Limbaugh to stop by any
time soon for a book signing. But
that
doesn’t
mean
that
conservatives
w on’t
find
anything of interest at the store,
unless the only thing they care
about is politics.
“The store was founded from a
leftist political movement in
1969. We have matured since
then to encompass a library of
books that appeals to a larger
audience, but of course we are
still more liberal than a chain
bookstore,”
explained
Lisa
Greening, an employee at the
store for two years and a co­
owner during the last year and a
half.
For its final literary event of
January, Left Bank Books will
welcome M arilyn Heldman, a
local historian. She will discuss
and present her book “African
Zion,” a study of religious icons
and history of Northern Africa.
The presentation starts at 7:30
p.m. this Thursday.
Left Bank Books is located at
399 N. Euclid in St. Louis. For
more information call (314) 3676731.

Women’s hoops up record to 8-2 in conference
■ BY JASON TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
The Cougar women’s basketball team is rolling again as
they upped their conference record to 8-2 by defeating
Indianapolis last Thursday and Northern Kentucky on
Saturday.
Indianapolis had a 7-10 record going into the game at
Nicoson Hall in Indianapolis. A crowd of nearly 450 people
looked on to watch the Lady Greyhounds take a quick lead
four seconds into the first half on a jum per by Indy guard
Karrie Hochgesang who had 13 points on the night. Then a
layup from Cougar forward Alicia Harkins evened the
score at two.
A pair of Cougar threes from Misi Clark and Kim Lowe
five minutes into the game brought SIUE within one
making the score 11-10 in Indy’s favor. SIUE never led in
the half again with the help of two Indianapolis scoring
runs that held the Cougars down 33-31 at the end of the first
half.
“We simply weren’t hitting our shots early,” Cougar
head coach Wendy Hedberg said. “Later, we were able to
settle in and run our offense and do the things we wanted to
do.”

■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Two intense conference games
left the SIUE m en’s basketball
team m entally and physically
exhausted.
The Cougars needed double
overtime to down Indianapolis
103-99 last Thursday at Nicoson
Hall in Indianapolis, Ind.
Down 13 points with under 11
minutes to play in regulation, the
SIU E coaching staff told its
players that if they would stay
close they would have an
opportunity to win.
With 10 minutes remaining,
Rusty Sames and Tommy Shum
both drained three-pointers and
the lead was cut to five. Nathan
Kreke had three field-goals and
M arlin Clark knocked down two
three-point bombs on a run that
saw SIUE take the lead by two.
Down 73-71, Indianapolis tied
the game with one second on the
clock to send the game into an
extra period.
The Cougars tried not to think
back to a week ago when they
were upset by W isconsinParkside in overtime on a last
second desperation shot. Instead,
SIUE stayed focused and beat the
dem on that let W isconsinParkside back into the game —
missed free throws.
After a 16 point effort by both

;

To drain or not to drain was the Cougar’s motto in the
second half. They shot 76 percent from the field by hitting
16 of their 21 shots taken.
Early in the half, Leslie Phillips, who started the game at
shooting guard, hit a three that took the lead 39-37 and the
Cougars never looked back. A 10-0 scoring run later in the
half also helped SIUE to keep the Greyhounds at bay.
The two SIUE freshmen, Clark and Erica Cory hit five
free throws between them in the final minute of play to
assure the victory 76-73.
Clark finished leading all scorers and rebounders with
23 points and nine boards. Indy guard Kim Lawrence
tallied 18 points and six assists to lead her team.
On Saturday, the Cougars were stung by the Northern
Kentucky Norse early in the game and SIUE could only
m uster eight points through the first fifteen minutes
of play.
“In each of the two games we got off to slow starts,”
Hedberg said. “We were out of sync early in both games.”
SIUE fought back and did it the hard way. They capped
off the first half by dominating NKU with a 14-5 scoring
run. The run was highlighted by SIUE going eight of 11
from the charity stripe down the stretch to finish the half
24-22 in NKU’s favor.
SIUE went to the line 45 times in the game and hit 27 of

squads in the first overtim e,
SIUE sank six of six from the
charity stripe in the second OT to
clinch the four point victory.
“D efensively
we
played
great,” assistant coach Scott
Eggleston said. “We contained
their three-point shooters. We
were mostly worried about their
size coming in, but we did a
good job in denying their big
guys inside.”
Kreke and Sames led the
Cougars by combining for 27
rebounds and scoring 26 and 20
points respectively.
Fatigue plagued SIUE in
the second half o f its game
against No. 18 ranked Northern
Kentucky.
Only down two at the break,
the Cougars liked their chances
for upsetting the nationally
ranked team while playing in
Highland Heights, Ky.
“We played an outstanding
first half,” Eggleston said.
“Northern Kentucky is known for
playing extremely intense and we
m atched their intensity in the
first half.”
W ith a couple o f players
fighting illness, the Cougars
cou ld n ’t run with Northern
K entucky in the second half.
Northern Kentucky pulled away
for the 80-71 victory dropping
SIUE to 12-5 overall and 6-4
in the G reat Lakes Valley
Conference.
“We simply ran out of gas,”
Eggleston said.
SIU E will dive into more
GLVC action when they face
Southern Indiana in Evansville,
Ind. on Thursday.
“We need the same intensity
that w e’ve been playing with for
these
up-com ing
gam es,”
Eggleston said. “Everyone needs
to be contributing on the glass.”

the attempts. They shot only five of 22 from the floor in the
first half and their free throws literally saved them.
“NKU is always physical,” Hedberg said. “There wasn’t
much flow to the game because every time we got the ball
we went to the line. Free throws got us back into it. And if
we would have converted more of them I don’t think the
score would have been that close.”
Misi Clark tagged a three to start off the second half and
it was the shot that broke NKU. The Norse never led the
rest of the game. A series of free throws by Harkins, Clark
and Christina Loomis in the first 10 minutes only extended
SIUE’s lead 43-31.
Two three-pointers from NKU’s Katie Kelsey, and one
each from Michele Tuchfarber and Jamie Gamer brought
the Norse to within three and the game ended 54-51.
SIUE’s Kim Lowe finished in double figures with 14
points and 15 rebounds. Harkins led all scorers with 17
points in her 35 minutes of play.
SIUE will try to do it again when they visit Southern
Indiana this Thursday. Over the weekend, the women will
travel to Quincy to take on the Hawks to end the four game
road venture.
“USI is out to stick it to us,” Hedberg said. “They want
to prove that their loss to us was a fluke. They’re back at
first place in the conference and we will be ready for them.”
