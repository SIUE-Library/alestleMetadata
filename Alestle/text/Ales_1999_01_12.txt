Instructor organizes MS benefit
BY BARBARA DUMOULIN
NEWS REPORTER
Julie
Full-Lopez,
an
SIUE
instructor, has organized m ultiple
sclerosis fund-raisers for 20 years, since
she was first diagnosed with the illness.
Friday will be the first time the
fund-raiser comes in the form of a
heavy metal rock concert.
The
concert
will
feature
Cottonmouth, Earl Brothers, Stagger
James, Sweat Lodge, Ugly Stick and
Segue. The bands will perform from 7
p.m. until 1 a.m. Jan. 15 at Joshua’s
Banquet and Catering Center, 101
Eastgate Plaza in East Alton.
While MS fund raisers normally

consist of events such as walk-a-thons
and bike-a-thons, Full-Lopez thinks the
heavy metal rock concert might reach a
different kind of audience.
“We’ll do anything for money,” she
said. “If it works, it’s a good thing.
Maybe it’ll catch on and we could do
this every year.”
Full-Lopez works for Instructional
Services teaching English and basic
writing skills. She is one of more than
350,000 people who fight the battle
against MS daily. Multiple sclerosis is a
chronic, often disabling disease of the
central nervous system. Advances in
research and treatment are giving hope
to those affected by the disease.
Full-Lopez said that the money

raised from Friday’s concert will be
used to benefit the local Gateway Area
Chapter of the N ational M ultiple
Sclerosis Society.
“St. Louis is a think-tank for
research in MS,” she said. “Money that
is raised locally may be used for
anything from a microscope that costs
$20 to $25 thousand to a wheelchair for
someone who doesn’t have insurance to
pay for one. There are miracles
happening right here at hom e.”
Tickets for Friday’s concert are $10
for all ages. A full bar will be available
Bob FehringerlAlestle
to those 21 and older. For further
inform ation, contact Full-Lopez at Ju lie F u ll-L o p e z d is p la ys tic k e ts fo r

Shape you If image
BY VICKI BENNINGTON

Im proving
interview ing
techniques, m anners, attire,
grooming and etiquette are the
main goals of SIUE's IMAGE
program.
According to Jean Paterson,
director
of
the
C areer
D evelopm ent
Center,
o n e’s
image can mean the difference
between getting a job or not, and
can definitely affect the way
others view you.
The IM AGE program is
offered free to all SIUE students.
During
the
semester,

speakers
and
sem inars
concentrate on the skills needed
for employment and on ways to
enhance
each
student’s
employment potential.
Job search techniques, what
to w ear on an interview and how
to develop a good, professional
resume are among the subjects,
Paterson said.
“Simulated interviews with
representatives from major local
companies such as Olin Corp.
and
Boeing are generally
scheduled near the end of the
semester.

Student
residents
vs.
Housing may seem like a classic
case of "he said/she said," but an
understanding needs to be met by
both sides.
Last semester, on Thursday,
Dec. 3, Cougar Village resident
Tracy Thomas awoke at 9 a.m. to
the sound of rushing water inside
her apartment.
A fter jum ping up, she
realized she was standing in a
puddle of water spewing from a
drainpipe inside her furnace
closet. As her apartment filled
with
filthy
sewage
water
containing human waste, she
phoned apartm ent housing to
report the incident. "It was out
the door, down the hallway, into
my
room,
and
into
the
kitchen. Wall to wall was water,"

Thomas said.
Thomas said that it wasn't
until 10:35 a.m. that one man
from maintenance showed up,
expecting to solve the problem
with a small Wet-Vac. The water
continued to fill her apartment as
the maintenance man struggled.
"I had homework, a test that
morning, exams and no time to
deal with the flooding on top of
all of that," Thomas said.
A fter being told to call
housing about damages and
reimbursement, Thomas phoned
the C ougar Village Housing
Coordinator,
Scott
Gluntz.
Gluntz explained that the only
thing he could tell her to do was
to write a letter to the housing
director about the damages and
losses and wait for a reply.
Thomas said she was extremely
upset and did not feel that a letter
would do any good.

At 11:45 a.m. Thomas left
for class. At this time, almost
three hours later, help from
facilities management showed up
to stop the water and clean up the
mess.
"I am most upset that we
have to suffer for something that
is not our fault. My mom pays
too much money for me to go
here for my things to be damaged
due to som ething that is
absolutely not my fault," she
said. Thomas' damage included
an
expensive
rug,
many
schoolbooks, clothing and other
items that were on the floor at the
time of the flooding.

Supporter donates his home to SIUE
BY PATRICK EBERS
NEWS STRINGER
SIUE announced Wednesday
it has received a $1.3 million gift
from
longtim e
university
supporter B. Barnard Birger.
The gift, the second largest
in school history, consists of 12
acres of property in Collinsville,
111., including a 7000-square-foot
house,
a
gym nasium ,
a
swimming pool, and a lake.
"I
am
hopeful
this
contribution will assist the
university
in
continually
realizing
its
objective
of

providing affordable, quality
education, and helping our youth
make significant contributions in
their
professions
and
communities," Birger said.
Brad Hewitt, assistant to the
vice chancellor of development
and public affairs, said the gift is
a life estate, meaning Birger will
continue to live on the property.
The university can use the
property as collateral to secure a
loan to build a new facility for the
SIUE Foundation and Alumni
Services.
"The facility provides the
foundation with an asset to
borrow against,” Hewitt said.

“We will proceed as quickly as
possible in pursuing sites and
building design, and appropriate
approval; then we intend to build
a Foundation and Alumni
Services house, hopefully closer
to cam pus than the existing
location."
Hewitt also said construction
of the new facility could begin
within a year.
The SIUE Foundation and
Alumni Services are currently
located in an old house at the
edge of the campus near Illinois
Route 157.

Memorial will honor slain student

Ram onna M cDonald
BY BARBARA DUM OULIN
NEWS REPORTER
The life and achievements of
Ramonna D. M cDonald will be
celebrated at a memorial service

at 11:30 a.m. Thursday, Jan. 14
in the Lovejoy Auditorium.
McDonald died Dec. 21, a
victim of domestic abuse.
M cDonald was an SIUE
graduate student and served as a
graduate coordinator for the
mentor program in the Special
Services office.
Earleen Patterson, program
director of Special Services, said
McDonald was a very special
person
and
helped
many
freshm en through challenging
times.
“Ram onna touched the
hearts of all who knew her,”
Patterson said. “She was bright,
beautiful, sincere, com m itted
and giving. She was a gifted
communicator who encouraged
others with kind words and a
strong vision. Ramonna’s love of
life and learning was refreshing
to the discouraged.”
M cDonald had com pleted

her undergraduate work in 1997
and was working on her master of
science in biology.
“Her dream o f one day
becom ing a neurophysiologist
was unstoppable and inspiring,”
Patterson said. “ She gave of
herself and her tim e to tutor
students, organize events and
simply listen to others.”
In addition to her studies and
her work, M cDonald was the
mother of two young children. A
trust fund has been established in
McDonald’s name to help care
for them.
Donations to the fund can be
mailed to the Heartland Savings
Bank, 312 N. Sixth St., St. Louis,
MO, 63101. Telephone (314)
512-8800.
The m em orial service is
open to the
public. For

Services at 650-3790.

Later it was discovered that
the cause was an obstruction in
the pipes from tree roots. "It's a
bad deal, no m atter where
something like this takes place,"
Legate said.
With this type of obstruction
in the line, and the way the
sewage pipes are set up in the
apartm ents, flooding in one
apartm ent may result from a
neighbor's faulty pipes or
pressure
buildup,
Legate
explained.
Students
may
have
experienced other incidents with
Cougar V illage's plum bing.
However, it may be unfair to say
that all the plumbing is bad.
"A more specific statement
would be that the trees that were
planted 30 years ago near the 400
side buildings are now maturing
to the point where their roots are
pushing into underground pipes
and causing obstruction," Legate
said.
Housing officials said they
try to take care of recurring pipe
problems as quickly as possible.
This is done by digging up the

SIUE was not without
competition for the gift; BJC

University and the University of
Illinois also expressed interest in
obtaining the property.

old pipes and replacing them with
new ones.
"In the last five years we've
really made a major effort in
changing the pipes that have had
problems," Legate said.
The older pipes around the
buildings were originally made
from a type of clay that doesn't
resist the pressure from tree
roots.
Legate
said
that
m anagem ent is continuously
replacing these with new plastic
pipes.
Gluntz said that in a case
such as flooding, they try to find
the source and send staff over to
clean up the mess.
As for the potential for
personal items to be ruined,
Gluntz said, "If it is not a
negligence part on our end, it is
considered an act of God and the
university isn't necessarily liable,
especially when in our contract it
states that we encourage students
to get renter's insurance."
In the student housing
contract for Cougar Village
apartments, Section IV A states:
The resident is responsible for
personal effects. The university
will not reimburse the resident
for damage or loss of personal
effects resulting from natural

conditions or m alfunction of
plumbing or other systems. It is
strongly recommended that the
residents secure insurance on
their personal property and other
valuable possessions.
Gluntz went on to say, "I will
never discourage a student from
appealing a charge or challenging
one if they have to. That is that
resident's human right."
Although it may seem unfair
to residents, especially if they are
in an unfortunate situation where
personal
belongings
get
damaged, the residents would be
held accountable under the same
conditions
as
apartments
elsewhere.
"All I can explain to a
resident is that if there is a claim
to be made they must write to the
director of housing, because all
the billing and reimbursements
must come from them," Gluntz
said.
Housing
and
Facilities
Management said the call was
responded to as quickly as
possible and they did all they
could for Thomas by cleaning up
the mess and encouraging her to
submit an appeal to the housing
director
for
damage
reimbursement.

Paterson said.
Kyle Thompson, a graduate
assistant
in
the
Career
Development Center, said that all
Students can benefit from the
program.
“Starting early in your
college career to learn and polish
skills that will be needed after
graduation will only enhance the
college learning experience.
Many skills can also be utilized
in co-op assignments, as well as
general
social
situations,”
Thompson said.
All sessions from the fall
will be repeated during the spring
semester, and will be held from
11 a.m. to 12:15 p.m . every
Tuesday in Founders Hall, room
2407 or 2301. The School of
Business does not schedule
classes at that time to give more

people the opportunity to attend,
Paterson said.
Students
from
all
departments are welcome to mix
and
match
sessions
to
accom m odate
individual
schedules or needs, but the more
sessions attended the greater the
benefit, Paterson said.

Developm ent

and
the

The program’s final session
each semester is a reception and
meal that allows students to use
their skills at a mock business
dinner.

Birger said although the
competitors were worthy of the
gift, SIUE was his only choice.
"Three of my children went
through SIU...so it's kind of
hometown stuff to us," Birger said.
Birger has a long history with
SIUE. In addition to establishing
an
endowed
presidential

member of the SIUE Board of

member of the SIUE Foundation
Board of Directors.
Birger is chairman of BBB

dealerships, a real estate company,
and a construction company.

Guest column ------------ ----------------------------- Welcome to the madness
Beasts of burden backpacking books that we call the Alestle
I gave last sem ester’s grades
a decent burial under my sweat
socks in a bottom drawer. It was
the least I could do. It was time to
look forward with optimism, so I
joined the long, orderly line at
Lovejoy
Library
for
this
sem ester’s textbooks. I pay
attention to textbooks. I pay
attention to textbooks because I
have to carry them. Their width,
height and weight are the reason
backpack m anufacturers and
chiropractors have form ed an
alliance.
N evertheless,
I
was
unprepared when my turn came
and my load of books was hoisted
on the counter. I didn’t know how
to get them home. The addition of
a Papermate that worked and a
fresh notebook was trivial as I
dragged my burden to M erkle’s
Pack Mule Emporium. M erkle’s
motto is “Serving students’ needs

since 1875.”
M erkle’s has options to rent,
lease or buy pack mules. Rental
is the least expensive and may be
the best choice if a fifthgeneration Merkle leads forth a
spavined wretch. The renter is
not responsible if the mule dies
on the job.
The second option is a
semester or a yearly lease. With
this choice, M erkle’s provides a
five-month supply of oats and a
lead rope. However, should the
mule falter and succumb due to
overload during the period, the
contract states that the party of
the second part is liable for the
unexpired term and also the
expense of burial.
I made the decision to buy
the mule M erkle’s pulled out for
my inspection. It was a used
mule, but I was assured the
previous owner was a little old

lady who attended one evening
class a week. The mule was
slightly swaybacked, but it had a
gentle countenance and accepted
my heavy load of textbooks with
equanimity.
So
far,
our
relationship has been satisfactory,
and I look forward to exchanging
mule stories on the quad.
Beasts,
backpacks
and
baggage
carts
would
be
unnecessary if textbooks were
published in looseleaf ring
binders with detachable pages.
Entire
chapters
could
be
separated and carried to class
with the remainder left at home
until needed.
Until the weight of textbooks
is bearable, I shall depend on
Suiee, my pack mule.

The end is nigh.
This is the beginning of my last semester as the
Alestle’s editor-in-chief. As the millennium approaches,
so does my graduation from SIUE. But I do not plan on
slacking around the office during my last semester. We at
the Alestle are going to be busier than ever. With a large
Danielle
Belton staff again this semester, many of them Alestle veterans,
more campus news will be covered than in pervious years.
Also readers should expect to see more features and in-depth
reporting.
Readers can still look for Alii Khat’s anthrax-laced advice, see
what SIUE looks like through Jim Dalton’s somewhat skewed eyes
and I will still be doing my own ranting and raving to the pleasure of
some and the aguish of others. If you didn't agree with me last year,
don’t expect to agree with me much more in 1999.
Mike Montgomery is the adviser for Student Publications and
has returned for his second semester. Montgomery has brought to the
Alestle a more professional approach when it comes to the job of
putting a newspaper together. As a seasoned professional in print and
broadcast, Montgomery has worked to have the Alestle’s operations
mirror more of a commercial newspaper’s attributes
Also returning is Lifestyle Editor Sheri McWhirter, back for her
second semester. Luckily, the first semester didn't scare her off. We
are fortunate to have her. With a sem ester’s worth of experience
behind her, readers should expect to see more of M cW hirter’s witty
and irreverent style.
We have a new sports editor, Tony Ammann. Amanan has
written for the sports section and has proven to be a reliable and
talented reporter. Now he’s stepping up to the plate as the section
editor. As with any editor at the Alestle, Ammann welcomes your
comments. W e're sure he’ll do a great job bringing the latest sports
news to the readers.
Bob Fehringer is back again as our photo editor. So many of the
photographs in the Alestle are Bob’s work. As a veteran Air Force
photographer, Fehringer does outstanding work and he shares his
expertise with his two staffers.
The Alestle is looking for a news editor. We would like it if all
you potential news editors would stop being shy and send in an
application. The role is vital for further development of the Alestle.
Also there are still plenty of room at the Alestle for more writers.
We encourage all writers at SIUE, whether journalism students or
not, to apply for a reporter position. The work is challenging and
rewarding. There’s nothing like seeing your own work in black and
white for thousands to read.
I am also searching for my replacement. Those interested in
being editor-in-chief can give us a call to find out about the search
process and application.
For all you enquiring minds (whether looking for work or
looking for an ear), call us at 650-3528 or e-mail us via our website
at www.siue.edu/ALESTLE/Alestle.html. W e’re happy to help you,
because after I’m long gone, the Alestle must go on.

Coming right on the heels of their last
album "Yield," which brought them back
into the spotlight as far as I am
concerned, is "Live on Two Legs."
While some of their material may not
be for everyone, this new CD offers all of
their sure-fire winners. Songs like
"Daughter," "Better Man" and their
newest songs like "Given to Fly" and "Do
the Evolution" are included in this
compilation album.
The best part about this album is that
all the tracks are recorded live, hence the
name. Each song is belted out with the
enthusiasm evident only in a concert you
would talk to your friends about for days.
The best part is that there is no down time
-- it's like a whole concert where all of the
songs are performed perfectly. It is the
absolute must-have for anyone who likes
Pearl Jam but isn't exactly crazy about all
of their music.
This album has sparked a new
interest in a band that I had almost given
up on. The twists and turns that they have
taken, like touring with Neil Young and
trying to play different venues other than
TicketMaster, makes them even more
interesting. They hit the mark on this one.
Pearl Jam has made an excellent
contribution to the musical world of live
albums.

The best Christmas gift that I
received this year was a compact disc
given to me by my girlfriend. It was not a
CD by a band I would have normally
asked for, but I had seen the album in
stores a few days before Christmas, and it
looked interesting. It is a band that has
withstood the test o f time and the rough
ride in its fight against the "man"
(particularly TicketMaster). The band has
taken some odd turns in its musical
career, but it has always had something
out there that is good and worth the effort
to listen to.
The band is, o f course, Pearl Jam.
The reason I would not have normally
asked for it is that I liked them back in
the days of "Ten" and "Vs." After that, it
just seemed like they faded away into the
background. I did not know if I wanted to
buy any of their new stuff because I did
not know that much about it. Part of this
is because of the effort made by the band
to keep ticket prices down and their
search for different avenues of recording.
By keeping a low profile it seems a good,
big-ticket band has entered the land of
the obscure.
With their newest release they have
made a welcome addition to their catalog.

M E N ’S HOOPS
Thursday, Jan. 14
vs. IUPU-Ft. Wayne 7:30 (H)

Students interested in
martial arts are welcome to
participate in Ninjutsu classes at
SIUE.
Dan Klimut, head instructor
of the Ninjutsu classes at the
Vadalabene Center, recommends
the class because it offers an
effective self-defense technique.
“The art is an obscure art by
its nature;” Klim ut said.
“It
conform s to the individual,
whereas orthodox karate forms
are very rigid and only prepare
you for confrontations with
skilled people skilled in similar
arts.”
Dave B arger is also an
instructor of Ninjutsu and travels
extensively giving seminars at
various Ninjutsu schools.
“The art is very practical,”
Barger said. “It isn’t any of this
double-flip, high-kick with a
backspring stuff you see in the
movies. It teaches the student to
use the body as a weapon.
Anyone can do this and do it
effectively.”

Dan K lim ut show s o ff his Ninjutsu talents to another fighter at a class he teaches.
Klim ut and Barger both
attended the Mid-America Ninja
and Self Defense Academy in
Fairview Heights, 111. They both
hold a Sandan, or third degree
black belt in Ninjutsu.
Klimut has trained with the
Grandmaster in Japan four times.
He has a brown belt in Shotokan

K arate as well.
Barger has
trained extensively in Tae Kwon
Do and is a former military police
officer.
A lthough no women are
currently enrolled in the class,
women are more than welcome
and encouraged to join.
Students who take the

N injutsu
course
can
take
advantage of the non-credit class
status attained by entering the
class.
Class times are 4-6 p.m. Monday
through W ednesday at the
Vadalabene Center. Students can
sign up for the clases in the
Rendlemann building.

Shooting troubles result in men’s
Cougar loss to the Quincy Hawks
Moss named GLVC co-player o f the week but misses game due to injury
BY CHAD BAALMAN
SPORTS WRITER

Less than a week after one of the
biggest wins in the program's history, the
SIUE men's basketball team was left trying
to regain that winning touch again.
In their trip north to Quincy University
on Thursday, the Cougars couldn't find it.
Quincy took advantage of a cold-shooting
first half on the part of the Cougars to come
away with an 87-77 win in Great Lakes
Valley Conference action.
The Cougars were fresh off a 91-72
victory over Kentucky Wesleyan on Jan. 2 at
the Vadalabene Center. Kentucky Wesleyan
came into the contest undefeated and ranked
No. 1 in the NCAA Division II poll.
Yet SIUE couldn't bottle up that magic
and take it to Quincy. "Our offense had a heck
of a time scoring in the first half," said SIUE
coach Jack M argenthaler, whose team
resumed GLVC play at the University o f
Missouri-St. Louis on Monday. "I went back
over the film, and we were getting good shots.
We just couldn't get them to drop."

The Cougars, who fell to 4-7 overall and
3-5 in the GLVC with the loss, were
outscored 41-21 in the first half by the
Hawks. SIUE was 6 of 22 from the field (27
percent) in the half, including 1 of 8 from
three-point range. "The first half was the
telling tale," Margenthaler said.
SIUE did perk up in the second half,
outscoring QU 56-46 while shooting 53
percent from the field and 46 percent from
beyond the three-point arc.
Travis Wallbaum led the SIUE attack
with 19 points and 11 rebounds. Ben Wierzba
(17 points), Derek Cowan (16) and Ryan
Cross (11) also chipped in nicely for the
Cougars.
Marty Hull poured in a game high 25
points for the Hawks (5-5, 4-3). QU came
back to hand Southern Indiana (11-2, 7-2) a
99-76 defeat at home two nights later.
Southern Indiana had captured the No. 1
ranking in Division II from Kentucky
Wesleyan.
The Cougars were without leading scorer
Ty Moss, a freshman guard from Centralia.
Moss was averaging 13.7 points per game but
suffered an ankle injury on Wednesday during

practice. M argenthaler expected Moss to be
in the lineup for the UMSL game.
"It didn't look that bad at first but he
couldn't go," M argenthaler said. "He's our top
scorer and if you take him out of there that
hurts offensively."
Moss was honored for his efforts the
previous week by being named the Co-Great
Lakes Valley Conference player of the week.
The 5 foot 11 Moss averaged 21.5 points in a
two-gam e span, including 21 against
Kentucky Wesleyan.
"That's a nice honor considering he's a
freshman and there's only been one other time
that a freshman's done that since I've been
here," Margenthaler said.
Jason Holmes (1993-97), SIUE's all-time
leading scorer, was the only other freshman to
earn that honor.
Now M argenthaler is looking for his
Cougars to hit their stride as the GLVC season
progresses. "We're looking for some
consistency, especially on the offensive end,"
Margenthaler said. "If we could do that, we
wouldn't have to battle back from behind
every time.
