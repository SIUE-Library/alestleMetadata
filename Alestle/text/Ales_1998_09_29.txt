Police pursuing
war on speeders

Program aims
to eliminate
discrimination

BY PAUL HOLLOWAY
NEWS STRINGER

BY ALICIA MIDDENDORF
NEWS STRINGER

Stepped-up efforts to curb
speeding on the campus have
resulted in 54 tickets in the last
three weeks.
SIUE police began a
crackdown Sept. 7 on University
Drive. Campus police have
increased their efforts on
University Drive from 7 to 9 a.m.
and 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.
O fficials have cited higher
enrollment and more residential
students as reasons for the
increased enforcement efforts.
SIUE Police Chief Rich
Harrison said the increased
vehicle and pedestrian traffic
heightens the possibility of
accidents.

Some people may struggle
with disabilities, but they have
abilities and rights too.
That
is
why
during
D isabilities Awareness Month,
SIUE w ill present Disability
Awareness Day on Wednesday,
Oct. 7. The 1998 D isability
Awareness Day is the first to be
held on the campus in 10 years.
Disability Awareness Day is
sponsored
by
SIUE
New
Horizons, the office of the
chancellor, the SIUE Foundation,
the office of the assistant provost
for cultural and social diversity
and the office
o f equal
opportunity programs.
Activities for the day will
take place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
in the Goshen Lounge and
Hickory/Hackberry Room of the
Morris
U niversity
Center.
R epresentatives
from
local
vendors and agencies, such as
Easter
Seals,
w heelchair
com panies and epilepsy and
multiple sclerosis organizations,
will attend.
From 10 to 11 a.m., lawyer
Salome M. H eyward and a
student panel will answer
questions concerning the rights
and responsibilities o f students
with disabilities.

“ We have a lot o f cars on
campus, both from students and
em ployees, and from people
cutting through campus on the
w ay home and to work,”
Harrison said.
The ch ief said people
driving on University Drive must
understand two things.
“ First, the speed limit
through the main part o f campus
is 25 miles per hour. Also, on the
SIUE campus pedestrians have
the right o f way.

With so much foot and
vehicle traffic on campus, we
have to be even more watchful
that these two rules are followed.
In that regard, we will be writing
tickets for anyone exceeding the
speed limit, or not yielding to
pedestrians,” Harrison said.
He noted that o f the 54
citations issued as o f Sunday, a
few were DUIs, “ but most were
speeding on or around campus
and disregarding stop signs and
pedestrians.”
While some m ay think the
heightened enforcem ent is an
attempt to get more revenue,
Harrison said that is not the
case. Traffic violations are issued
on state tickets, he said. The
money made from these tickets
does not go to SIUE, but to
Madison County.
“ If you get a traffic
violation, you have to go to the
Edwardsville Courthouse, just
like you would if you received a
ticket on 270 or bn a city street,”
Harrison said.
He
added
that
with
increasing
enrollm ent,
the
opening o f Highway 255 and
more students living on campus,
the SIUE police will be more
watchful.

Saturday. Awards for Greek Week were presented.

The greeks are pursuing
excellence at SIUE.
Eleven
m em bers
were
inducted into the order of Omega,
an organization that promotes
excellen ce among the greek
societies.
Bill
Anderson,
chapter
president o f the Order of Omega
said, “ The purpose o f our
organization is to inform the
public about the positive aspects
of greek life. We are not just a
bunch of beer-guzzling savages.”
Up to 15 undergraduate

students can be accepted into the
cam pus chapter each year.
Alumni
and
honorary
memberships are also offered in
certain circumstances.
Grahaeme Hesp, student
adviser to the Order of Omega,
said approximately 30 members
o f the organization attend SIUE.
Members are chosen based
on several criteria:
Candidates’ grade point
average must be above the allgreek average but not below a
2.75.
Initiates
m ust
show
leadership in their own greek
organizations, national greek

events and the local community.
Finally, candidates are asked
what they have to offer and what
they think the organization is
about.
“ I feel that we make a
presence on cam pus,” said
Heather Mueller, a new member
o f the Order of Omega.
“ We also show people that
you
can
keep
academ ic
excellen ce and still help the
campus and the community.”
Mueller is the chair o f the
Finance Board for the student
government. Last year she w as a
student senator.

T uesday , S eptember 29, 1998

A fish called Danielle
I attended the Greater St. Louis Association of Black
Journalists Excellence Awards Saturday.
I’ ve never known how to act at upscale social
gatherings. Although I am normally a talkative, energetic
person, at these parties I become shy and nervous. There is
just something frightening about a room full of adults all
Danielle dressed up in gaudy clothes with chamber music playing. I
Belton can't talk. I can’t walk. I’ m completely filled with fear. The
only thing I can do is eat. I suppose I can do that because it’s
instinctual. Also, if your mouth is full of food, you don’ t have to talk. You
can even pretend not to notice that no one is talking to you.
I didn’t know anyone there and no one said anything to me.
I felt like a fish out of water, wanting to just flop around, grasping
for life. But I didn’t because I feared that everyone would look at me and
think I’m not a young, educated woman. They’d see that I’ m a fish —
and not even a very good one.
When I voiced my fears to my father, he leaned over and told me to
expect a lot more events like this in my lifetime. Saturday’s get-together
was actually the fifth or sixth such event I have attended. In all of them,
except for one where I was a speaker, I was filled with the same fishy
fear. But I didn’t truly understand it until this weekend.
I’m not an adult. I’ m probably the only person my age who will say
that. I will be 21 on Oct. 8, but I am not an adult. I may read, write and
think on an adult level. I may have all the adult body parts. 1 might even
sound like an adult, but I am not. Legally, I am; mentally, I don’t think
so. I have no real money. My parents pay for my education and rent.
When I get sick, I receive discounted medicine and full health coverage
from my father's health plan. When I am hungry. I use the money my
parents have given me to buy food or when I go home to visit, I bring
food back with me. Every time I start to think I’m grown, because some
days I even fool my self, something like a dinner will come along and
put me in my place.
When the woman at the reception counter Saturday asked me who
I was and about my tickets, she did all the talking. I froze. I think I
mumbled a few words, but otherwise I was paralyzed with fear and kept
looking back at my parents to save me. All I needed to say was, "My
name is Danielle Belton. I am a judge and these are my four guests, my
family. The reservations are under the name Belton. My parents already
paid for the tickets because the check is in the mail.”
If I had been at Six Flags I could have done it. If I was at a movie
theater, it would have flowed with ease. But because my parents were
looking at me and that woman was old enough to be my mother, I
couldn’t say a thing. All I could say was my name. Me, someone who
had given a speech in front of my entire sixth grade class and our parents
and teachers when I was 12. Me, who gives class presentations with ease.
I was a fish. I suddenly didn’t understand English. I just stood there. I
mumbled my name and looked to my parents for guidance. And over and
over again I could hear the voice nagging me in the back of my head
saying, “ You are not grown.”
Everyone there knew I wasn’t grown. Everyone in the room, except
for two young children was over 30. The majority of them were black.
Possibly just two people acknowledged my existence as I stuffed my
mouth full of shrimp to keep from looking too much like an impostor.
All the other people appeared to be quite sure of themselves or full
of themselves. It was one or the other. Either way, I was relieved when
the whole thing was over.
I look with envy at how easy my parents handle everything. But
they remind me that with time I will be the same way. I sit and wait for
the day when that will happen as if there were a set date or something. I
look forward to the day when my confidence is constant and not
sporadic, when my judgment is keen and when I can support myself
without their assistance. I sit and wait to grow up. I’ ll be so happy when
it happens.
I’ ve heard that some people never learn how to do or be any of those
things. I can only hope that I’ m not one of those people.

Saturday with the creation o f a new molten
metal sculpture, "Iron After Goldsworth,
Ode to Grisedale Forest. " It took Beasley
and his supporting staff five days to build
the framework for the 50-foot-long, snake­
