DeGarmo, who has been
with SIUE for four years, also
serves as the adviser of the Raise
Your Voice student committee.
Raise Your Voice, which has
discussed such issues as voting,
is a new addition to campus
activism.
“This is the first year that
we’ve been doing (Raise Your
Voice),” DeGarmo said. “This is

also my first presentation for
Raise Your Voice, but I have
done other presentations on
campus.”
W hile Raise Your Voice
schedules presentations once a
month, in February the group
will grow more active.
“February is going to be big
for us because it’s our civic
engagem ent m onth,” student
committee mem ber Rene Lewis
said. “On the fourth of February,
we have one called Refraining
from D iversity, and we have
several other ones underway for
February.”

A group of men at SIUE
recently began organizing the

Cannon said the committee

Wilson said the university is
tolerant to the existence of
alternative lifestyles.
“We’re not at a hate stage,”
Wilson said. “A t least we can say
everyone has a right to be here. I
think that’s a good thing.”
Cannon said the committee’s
next big project is to get the
university to extend insurance

gay, bisexual and lesbian faculty
members. The benefits are
currently only available to

at
3:30
p.m.
Tuesday
in the Facilities
Management Conference Room.

Parking Services Committee
member Laura Scaturro said the
event’s capacity for students and
staff has already been filled.
After receiving around 25
requests for seats, Scaturro said the
committee had to stop accepting
reservations.
“You can only get so many
people around a vehicle,”
Scaturro said.
Participants will learn car
basics like how to change oil,
check fluid levels and jump-start
a battery. A demonstration
vehicle will allow for hands-on
learning.
The workshop will feature
Curt Watters, former vocational

automotive technology instructor
at the East St. Louis Community
College Center.
“He’s very good,” Scaturro
said. “I just wish we could do
som ething to make room for
more students and staff.”
Scaturro said this sem ester’s
workshop differs from those in
the past because the vehicle will
be displayed on a hydraulic lift
for better visibility.
For now the workshops will
continue to be once each
semester.
“We’re trying to show
Parking Services is doing some
good things,” Scaturro said. “Not

Students work for right to fly Old Glory

C h ie f c o p y e d i t o r :

G r a p h ic s / p r o d u c t io n :

A

In M onday’s St. Louis PostDispatch there was a story about
two 21-year-old St. Louis
University students who won an
argument about w hether they
should be able to hang an
American flag from their campus
apartment balcony.
The university had a 4-yearold policy stating, “Nothing is to

be hung from balcony/patio,
including but without limitation
to flags, strands o f lights, wind
chim es, or any other items.
Violation
may
result
in
confiscation of such items for
the remainder of the academic
year.”
Due to the protests of the
two students who have been
displaying the A m erican flag
since shortly after the attacks on
Sept. 11, 2001, the school now
exempts American flags from the
list. One of the students even
wrote a letter to his congressman
to help change the rule.
The two students had been
told to remove the flag from their
apartment balconies or face a
fine.
The
president
of
the
university, the Rev. Lawrence
Biondi, refused to change the

rule, but as the deadline for a
showdown came closer, school
officials looked into the case and
decided to let the American flag
be displayed if students choose to
do so.
One school official said,
“This was just the proper thing to
do.”
You bet it’s the proper thing
to do. The flag is the symbol of
America, and if people are going
to support their country and want
to fly an American flag, they
should have that right.
I understand rules are made
for a reason, and that having
things hanging from balconies
can look tacky and maybe
cluttered, but there are exceptions
to every rule, and I think this one
was a good decision.
I’m glad to know people’s
opinions do count for something

and that two college students who
voiced their opinions and stood
up for what they believe can
actually make a difference.
I bet when those two
students first hung up the flag,
they never thought their opinions
would change a rule that had
been in effect for four years.
This is what America is all
about.
Freedom o f speech and the
ability to voice your thoughts and
opinions are things I think we
take for granted too often in this
country.
I think these students should
be commended for standing up
for themselves and bringing a
little bit o f patriotism onto an
American college campus.

Letter to the Editor

Hard work will not go unnoticed
The Mr. M iaka Pageant, in
the M orris U niversity Center
Conference Center Oct. 30, was a
very pleasurable experience for
most of those in attendance and
participants alike.
After all, an evening during
which six m ultitalented men have
the opportunity to show the world
what they have to offer, whether
it be in fashion, w ritten
expressions, culinary arts or
comedy, is worth an hour or two.
What had some feeling as if
they wasted their evening was not
the participants, nor the outcome
of the event.
The behavior of a few
individuals
threatened
to

Political Cartoon

overshadow the event’s purpose,
as well as the hard work and
effort put in by the ladies o f
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc.
So this will not be the event
during
w hich
a
talented
individual won a scholarship.
Nor one where the purpose of the
pageant, which is to raise funds
for charity and health research is
remembered by many.
Instead, it will be known as
the event during which a certain
group’s
com m ents
became
personal attacks.
It will be known as the event
in which an audience member
was ushered out by an AKA for
standing inches from the stage

during a segment and hurling
insults at a contestant. It will be
known as another event in which
a good cause was nearly eclipsed
by childish behavior - unless that
changes today.
I would first like to
congratulate the women of Alpha
Kappa Alpha for sponsoring such
an event. Not only is it a positive
aspect of your organization, but a
chance to give back to the
community.
The overall purpose of the
event will not be forgotten, and
your hard work and efforts in
planning and hosting the event
will not go unnoticed.
Secondly, I would also like
to thank the
-------------------contestants for
taking
the
high
road
throughout
the
contest
and showing
maturity
w h e n
presented
w i t h
immaturity.

There is little doubt that,
whether winning a prize or not,
each o f you accomplished
something by stepping onstage
for an evening and sharing your
gifts with those in attendance.
Normally this is the point in
which an average letter would
ask those who have negativity to
stay home from such events in
the future.
Instead, I hope everyone
learned something that evening:
when faced with adversity, the
ones we applaud at the end of the
evening are the ones who are
standing onstage in front of
us, as opposed to being shown
the door.
This
may
not change
anyone’s mind, but the options
are always available.
Next time, will you respect
those who
are trying to
accomplish something positive or
present yourself in a less-thanflattering light? The choice is
yours.

Grad assistants make the best of teaching
N ic o l e S h o r t
L i f e s t y l e s S t r i n g f .r

M ost universities employ graduate
assistants in some or all areas of study. But
certain questions arise as to whether these
students teaching other students are really
effective or not.
While some universities may have
difficulty with their graduate assistants,
SIUE seems to have a fairly effective
program for m onitoring and preparing
students to teach in the classroom.
Most graduate assistants at SIUE
teach introductory courses.
Chris Stevens, a second-year music
graduate student, teaches Music 124, an
introductory music theory class.
Stevens also helps co-conduct the
University Band.
Stevens had some experience giving
private lessons and directing other bands
before undertaking the music theory class.
Overall, Stevens said, he doesn’t think
he has problems with his class.
“It’s a pretty smooth running class,”
Stevens said. “ I encounter typical
problems that every instructor does, such
as students not showing up to class and
doing poorly as a result.”
One problem some may think
graduate assistants encounter is a lack of
respect since they are not regular
professors. Fortunately, Stevens said, he
has never encountered this problem.
“Every once in a while, a student will
challenge me to see how well I know the
material, but soon enough they learn that I
do,” Stevens said.
Stevens has a fairly m ainstream
approach to teaching his classes.
“I put the responsibility for their
success in their hands,” Stevens said.
“They determ ine their grade by their
performance.”
Darryl Coan is Stevens’ adviser for
his classes.
Before entering the classroom alone,
Coan and Stevens met regularly to discuss
many different things that are supposed to
happen in the classroom.
“We talked about teaching strategies
beforehand once a day for a couple hours
the week before the class started,” Stevens
said. “And now I touch bases with him at
least once a week, and he asks me how
things are going and helps me if I need it.”
Matt Hoormann is also a second-year
grad student in the Music Department.
Hoormann co-conducts the University
Band with Stevens and also works in the
music library.
Hoormann is a trombone player who
showed proficiency in his undergraduate
years and was invited to participate in an
assistantship with music professor John
Bell. The assistantship is co-conducting
the band.
Like Stevens, Hoormann said he does
not encounter any problems with students
refusing to give him respect as an
instructor.
“In the music setting, students are so
willing to be there that they don’t cause
any problems,” Hoormann said. “They are
actually very well-behaved.”

work out any problems they have.”
For those who think professors have
grad assistants to make their job easier,
Bell said to think again.
“It actually makes my job harder,”
Bell said. “I don’t have graduate assistants
to make my work easier. I use them as a
model for young students of an individual
who is developing professionalism . It
reinforces my principles that I teach in
class about professionalism and what it
means.”
Aside from the Music Department,
many other departments such as math,
speech
com m unication
and
mass
communications have graduate assistants
helping teach classes.
Leah W arhoover is a speech
communication graduate assistant who
teaches Speech 105, Public Speaking.
This is W arhoover’s second year for
teaching. She taught Speech 103,
Interpersonal Communications, last year.
Before applying for a graduate
assistant position, W arhooyer took
education
classes
during
her
undergraduate career.
Like the other grad assistants,
Warhoover said she does not believe her
students think of her differently, but rather
she said she thinks they relate better to her.
“I’m more o f the same age as my
students, so they’re more comfortable
talking to me,” Warhoover said. “Some
people have a problem with young females
teaching in the classroom, and they don’t
give me as much respect as I’d like them
to, but this is a rarity.”
Warhoover said she believes a teacher
has to earn respect from students, no
matter who the teacher is.
“If you establish credibility in your
classes, then you shouldn’t have a
problem,” Warhoover said.
Since she is close to the age of most of

personality has a lot to do with
how much respect a person earns,
whether it be a professor or a
graduate assistant.
“I think my grad assistants

them.”

concerned.
“I think I might learn a little
bit more with a professor who has
been teaching for longer, but
my grad assistant is a really
good teacher,” Thomas said. “I
don’t think that I am being
harmed academically by having

Thomas said she likes her
assistant in some ways better than
a regular professor.
“Our GA is relaxed and not

Unlike Lane and Cartwright,
Thom as said she does feel
students in her class try and take
advantage of the graduate
assistants.
“I think students do try to
take advantage of him,” Thomas
said, “But he is quick-witted and
puts them back in their place
when they do.”

Ruffatto said she likes her

“Leah relates to me better
because she’s younger and less

than
my
regular
professors,”
Ruffatto
said.
“When she teaches, she makes
things fun, so I remember more
information and I am less likely
to space out.”
For some students who think
that having a grad assistant will
get them less work, Warhoover
may offer a surprise.
“I respect Leah as any other
professor,” Ruffatto said. “Her
grading is strict, and her tests are
as hard as any o f my other
professors’.”

The
SIUE
American
Collegiate Hockey Association
Division II Hockey Club is off to
a strong start.
The ACHA Division II Gold
team, ranked eighth in the latest
Central Division coaches’ poll,
has skated to a 9-3 start.
In the 12 games, the Cougars
have outscored their opponents
520-273, resulting in 94 goals.
Behind returning goalie,
junior Pat Day, the team has only
been scored against 44 times this
season.
Head coach Larry Thatcher
said
the
team
has
high
expectations for the season.

The team ’s goals include a
trip to nationals this year, but first
and foremost, the team is looking
to repeat as Central Division
champions.
On the 24-person squad, new
faces include freshm en Ryan
Theen, Chance Webb, Kyle

Thatcher said the hockey
club continues to get stronger
each year.
“Having both varsity (Gold

progress we are m aking,”
Thatcher said. “Fans who come
out to watch us see solid hockey.
We get a lot done during each
game, taking a lot o f shots and
scoring goals. We have a lot to
offer fans as far as excitement
goes.”

Fall for Fitness Day

6, 2003 ♦

The volleyball team is on the
closest thing it’s had to a losing
streak this season, dropping two
out of the last three matches.
The Cougars lost three out of
four games with the Central
Missouri
State
University
Jennies, 28-30, 28-30, 30-24 and
20-30 Tuesday.
“Last night, we were tied a
couple of times, and it’s that little
break that makes the difference in
who wins the match,” head coach
Todd Gober said. “1 have to give
a lot of credit to Central Missouri
because they had a lot of things
that were working for them. They
had an effective slide going, and
it was tough for us to slow that
down most of the night. We knew
that they had three big go-to
hitters, and we went into the
match only ready to contain one.”
Central M issouri junior
middle hitter Elyse M ohme
flattened the Cougars with 23
kills while senior outside hitter
Carrie Potthast laid down 19 kills
for the Jennies.
Senior middle hitter Andrea
Voss led SIUE with 17 kills, and
sophomore outside hitter Kindra
Westendorf contributed 14 kills.
“It feels like right now we
have taken a couple of losses in
our last games,” Gober said. “I
am not disappointed with the way
we are playing right now. I just
think we have run into a couple of

teams that have been playing
really strong volleyball.”
Even with a couple of losses,
Gober said he isn’t concerned the
Cougars, 22-6 overall and 10-2 in
the
G reat
Lakes
Valley
Conference, will crack.
“I am not worried about any
lack of confidence right now,”
Gober said. “It’s hard to pull a
positive out of a loss. We have a
good work ethic and a good
attitude. The question will be
whether or not we can raise our
game one more notch. That will
be the challenge this weekend
and next weekend in conference.”
Gober said the Cougars don’t
have time to think about losses
because if they do, other teams
will leave them in the dust.
“Everyone else in the
conference will be working
harder and stepping it up a
notch,” G ober said. “I really
believe that we are going to work
hard and im prove. Somebody
may beat us, but right now we are
not going to beat ourselves.”
The C ougars have two
games remaining in the regular
season
before
the
GLVC
Tournament.
SIUE will play the first of
two weekend matches at 7 p.m.
Friday in Romeoville against the
Lewis University Flyers.
The C ougars will hit the
court at 1 p.m. Saturday in
Kenosha, Wis., to do battle with
the U niversity o f W isconsinParkside Rangers.
