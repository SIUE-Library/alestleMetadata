U.S. Department of
Education backlogged in
processing applications
By Brian Walsh
News Editor
Student-aid experts and the U .S.D epartm ent of Education are
playing the blam e game in the mismanagem ent of financial aid
applications filed since January.
Student-aid experts say the backlog of 900,000 applications was
the result of the d ep a rtm en t’s m ism anagem ent, calling into
question the dep artm en t’s ability to m anage the student-aid
system.
The U.S. D epartm ent of Education says that the processing
delay was brought on by com puter problem s afflicting departm ent
contractors, problem s which grew during two governm ent
shutdowns and this w inter’s snowstorms.
Elizabeth Hicks, deputy assistant secretary for student financialassistance program s, blam ed the problem mainly on the
contractors while adding that the loss of 21 working days hindered
their work in processing 10 million applications.
The situation can affect the education departm ent’s ability to
ward off Republican attem pts to dismantle its direct-lending
program or even the departm ent itself.
The direct-lending program provides federal loan funds directly
to colleges, bypassing the banks and loan-guarantee agencies that,

Seven stu dents of S o u th ern Illinois U niversity at
Edwardsville traveled to Fulton, Mo., on Saturday to
attend the cerem onies of the 50th Anniversary of Winston
Churchill’s Sinews of Peace “ Iron C urtain” speech.
F orm er Prime M inister M argaret T hatcher was the
featured sp eak er at the event which com m em orated
C hurchill’s historic speech on M arch 5, 1946, at
W estm inster College, Mo., that declared the onset of the
Cold War.
In his speech 50-years-ago, Churchill declared that
“from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron
curtain has descended across the continent.”
The m etaphor would become a symbol of the East-W est
conflict that would control world affairs for 45 years.

Around the World
State and Local---------------------------------------MetroLink penalty bill is approved by House
• Uniform regulations and penalties for violators on the M etroLink rail
system in St. Louis would be established by a two-state compact agency under
legislation passed in the house.
U nder the current law, the Bi-State D evelopm ent Agency has had a difficult
time establishing regulations, enforcing them and collecting penalties because
the rail system runs through three counties and five municipalities in Missouri
and Illinois.

Prosecutor rejects execution for Du Pont
• Multimillionaire John E. du Pont will not face the death penalty when he
goes on trial in the slaying of an Olympic wrestler, the district attorney said
Tuesday.
Delaware County Prosecutor Patrick M eehan said his office had concluded
the case lacked the aggravated circumstances necessary to invoke the death
penalty.
U nder Pennsylvania law, any of 16 aggravating circumstances must be
present—such as the torture of a victim, a previous m urder conviction on the
part of the defendant or if the slaying was committed during a robbery—for
the prosecutor to request the death penalty.
Du Pont is charged with shooting wrestler Dave Schultz to death in front of
Schultz’s house on du P ont’s suburban Philadelphia estate on Jan. 26.

International------------------------------------------Gorbachev gets votes to put name on ballot
• Form er Soviet President Mikhail G orbachev’s backers have gathered the
1 million signatures needed to put his name on the ballot in the June
presidential elections.
Alexei Manannikov, leader of the group backing G orbachev’s presidential
bid, told a news conference Tuesday that his candidate stood a good chance of
winning despite dismal ratings in opinion polls.
M anannikov said Gorbachev would get the vote of the “silent majority,” the
so-called third force between the extremes of President Boris Yeltsin and
Communist Party candidate G ennady Zyuganov.
Gorbachev has said he intends to run for the presidency, but has not yet
made an official announcem ent.

By Roy Gilmore
at a spectator o r not talk to the
press. Instead, because of his
beliefs, religious and moral, he did not stand up when the
national anthem was being played.
According to NBA deputy com m issioner Russ Granik,
all players, coaches and trainers must “stand and line up
in a dignified posture” during the U.S. and Canadian
anthems.
...one nation under God...
Abdul-Rauf, who converted to the Islamic faith in
1991, has not stood up for the national anthem this entire
season. With his strong belief in his faith, he has said that
he is willing to sit out the rem ainder of the season— not
trying to show up the NBA, but because of his beliefs.
“My beliefs are m ore im portant than anything,” he
said in an article in W ednesday’s USAToday. “If I have to
give up basketball, I will.”
A bdul-R auf says that he doesn’t stand because he sees
the Am erican flag as a “symbol of oppression, of
tyranny,” som ething that he says this country has a long
history of.
And when he says these things, he is not m eaning
them just toward African-A m ericans, but toward all
minorities and Caucasians who are and have been treated
unjustly.
He also said the Koran states that nothing should
come between him and Allah.
...indivisible...
The question to the N B A is what happened to those
constitutional rights of freedom of religion, freedom of
expression and freedom of speech? D o they walk out of
the door because you say so?
It’s insane to think that the N B A would do som ething
like that. I m ean, professional sports has let drug addicts
back into their leagues over and over again.
They let Rosanne attem pt to sing the national anthem ,
and when she spit after she was done, the whole world
laughed. Isn’t that a sign of disrespect?
And what about those people who burned the flag?
Did they not show disrespect? Even when they went to
court about it, it was declared one of their constitutional
rights of freedom of expression.
...with liberty...
The NBA should be asham ed of them selves for
making this issue much m ore than it really is. D uring
previous games, A bdul-R auf would stay in the locker
room during the anthem and then come back to the court
for tip-off. That didn’t seem to cause any problem s with
the Nuggets or for any fans who didn’t know about it. But
now with the exposure, the NBA is opening up a can of
worms they d o n ’t need to open.
It has gotten to the point that some people are starting
to sound simple minded. E d Wearing, state com m ander
of The Am erican Legion veterans organization in
Colorado, suggested that A bdul-R auf renounce his U.S.
citizenship.
C ’mon!
L et’s be realistic here. He has stayed in the locker
room and waited for the anthem to finish. W hat about
the fans who are talking, walking around, drinking beer
or doing som ething else besides standing during the
anthem ? Should we renounce their citizenship? That
sounds pretty stupid doesn’t it?
...and justice for all.
W hen A bdul-R auf m eets with NBA com m issioner
David Stern, hopefully Stern will continue to allow
A bdul-R auf to stay in the locker room for the anthem .
A bdul-R auf is showing no disrespect tow ard anyone.
He has his beliefs and he is sticking by them. W ouldn’t it
be nice if everyone who claims they are serious about
their faith were as strong and dedicated as A bdul-R auf?

Parking sticker increase solutionraise SIUE employees salaries
Whoa! W hat does SIU E think it is? The U.S.
Postal Service?
A nother parking stick er-increase? Fifty-five
dollars (or m ore) over the next two years? I’ve
done a little elem entary m ath and figured out that
a blue lot sticker now costing me $35 (a bit more
than .001 of my current annual salary) would cost
me $90 in two years (.003 of my annual salary). I
don’t expect this salary to change dramatically
over the next couple of years (or decades), so the
percentage shouldn't change.
Since Chancellor Belck was m entioned in the
Alestle article on 3/29 as being required to pay
the same am ount to park as the rest of us, I
decided to figure out what sort of bite a parking
sticker increase would take out of her paycheck—
around .001.
How about a kinder, gentler, m ore equitable
increase? L et’s take the .003 as the percentage
em ployees of SIU E would pay for stickers. Using
blue stickers as an example, that would m ean $90
for those earning $30,000, $150 for those earning
$50,000 (there are quite a few), and $350 for you,
C hancellor Belck.

Students would pay an extra $10 or so per year
for red stickers. O r m aybe we could be even m ore
progressive rath er than regressive. How about a
graduated parking sticker increase? .001 of salary
those earning $30,000 or less gradually rising to
.005 for those earning up to $50,000.
A nd for the truly blessed (or deserving)—
those earning $51,000 to $10,000+ per year—a
gradual rise to .01 of annual income. Student
could continue to pay $25 for red stickers.
If not enough revenue could be raised this way,
salaries (those on the lower end) could be raised.
1 know I would love the chance to pay $250 for a
parking sticker if it m eant I were earning $50,000
per year. Raise everybody’s salaries and watch the
m oney flow into S IU E ’s parking coffers.
Now, let’s talk about ways to pay off that
$1,000,000+ phone bill.

University should have guest
passes for residence hall parking
As a freshm an at the student residence hall I
have encountered an inconvenience which faces
my guests. The situation concerning parking for
friends and family of residents is unfairly
expensive.
T here is no free parking for guests which is
even rem otely close to the dormitory, and the
parking, which is som ewhat near, costs too much
for any visitor (who is not a SIU E student with
a valid parking sticker) who wishes to spend
considerable time visiting a resident and, of
course, they cannot park in a sticker lot without
a ticket being stuck on their windshield.
It is unrealistic to think all friends of residents
are either SIU E students with stickers or are
wealthy enough to afford the pay lot or the
m eters (which have a two hour limit). I believe

it is quite unfair to charge visitors of campus
residents when students live here and therefore
deserve visitors.
A fter much thought, 1 believe I have arrived
at a good solution! Why not give each resident
of the hall a reusable parking pass for guests?
W hen a visitor wishes to come to the hall, he or
she can pull into the circle drive and get the pass
from the resident, place it on their dash, then
park free of charge in the pay lot.
Though the university probably m akes a
great deal of m oney on residence visitor
parking, students pay much to live here and
th eir guests should not have to face this
unnecessary expense.

Financial Aid-------------------------from front page
in the past, dom inated the student loan system.
Congress approved a bill last fall that would have
limited direct lending to 10 percent of all studentloan funds. The President vetoed it.
Officials at many campuses around the country
fear that they will not be able to tell applicants how
much aid they’ll be offered by the time the students
must decide what college to attend.
The backlog of financial aid records has caused
problems with the num ber of records received by
SIUE. Student Financial Aid is currently working at
10 percent their expected volume.
The Student Financial Aid office expected over
2,000 financial aid records for 1996-97 by M arch 1.

T h e

A l e s t l e

Page

The num ber of actual records received was far from
that.
“So far, we have only received about 200 records,”
M arian Smithson, director of Student Financial Aid,
said.
SIU E had planned to start sending out award
letters to new freshman as early as March 15, but no
later than April 1.
A lthough the federal delay will not change the
tim etable on which the award letters are being sent
out, it will have an effect on the num ber of awards
that go out in the beginning.
Smithson said that Student Financial Aid will
process and award aid as quickly as they can after the
records are received.
“New freshman and transfer students will receive
awards beginning March 15,” she said. “Continuing
students will start receiving their awards in late

A pril.” '
The processing delays will only affect the time in
which a student will receive their award letter. It has
no effect on the funding of the program . Smithson
expects that funding for the 1996-97 school year will
be similar to the current year.
The late receipt of records will also have no effect
on stu dents M A P eligibility o r cam pus-based
eligibility.
Currently, the U.S. D epartm ent of Education has
hired additional employees who are working seven
days a week around the clock and have brought in an
additional processor to correct the problem.
Fixing the problem has become the departm ent’s
“highest priority,” they said. The U.S. D epartm ent of
Education does not expect to be caught up with the
backlog of financial aid applications until early April.

m em bers studying the in public relations
field, were not only there to listen to
T h atc h er— they w orked to set up the
event.
“Each of us w ere involved with the
anniversary in d ifferent w ays,” K aren
G reen, 1ABC m em ber, said. “Some of us
w orked the check-out desk. Some of us
carried cell phones and shadow ed PR
people. Some of us ran errands anlj faxes.
Some of us scouted the campus for.possible
interviews. Some of us helped to corral the
photographers.
“We all got a different perspective and
we all com pared notes at the end of the
day.”
To enhance the experience of working
at a m ajor event, the students observed
professionals in th e field of public
relations.
“ E ach S IU E stu d en t shadow ed a
professional PR person, which was an
invaluable learning experience,” G reen

A l e s t l e

said. “Shadwick U SA is a worldwide PR
firm so they w ere definitely seasoned
professionals.”
As a bonus to w orking the event,
students had a chance to listen to one of
the most powerful women in E ngland’s
history.
“Baroness T hatcher is such a wonderful
role m odel for wom en,” G reen said. “She
has the perfect com bination of strength
and grace.”
But not everybody agreed. In addition
to listening to T hatcher’s speech, students
also got the chance to witness the Irish
R epublican
A rm y
in
a
peaceful
dem onstration.
“I stood next to the IR A protesters
during the parade,” G reen said. “We didn’t
know they were going to dem onstrate until
that m orning.”
Students left the event knowing that
they were part of a once in a lifetime
experience, and were happy to be involved.
“It was really exciting to be part of the
news, as opposed to being a spectator,”
G reen said.

Kansas police department trying
to find missing documents
LA W REN CE, Kan. (A P )—Police are still trying to find
docum ents stolen from libraries at universities in Kansas and
Arkansas.
R obert H. Smith, 37, o f N orth Little Rock, Ark., was
arrested M arch 4 in Lawrence and charged with felony theft.
He is accused of taking seven letters with an estim ated value of
$10,000 from the Kansas Collection at K U ’s Spencer R esearch
Library in January or February.
Smith also is being investigated in A rkansas for the theft of
at least 49 docum ents from the University of A rkansas’ special
collections, 11 from the A rkansas History Commission in Little
Rock and an unknow n num ber from the library at the
University of A rkansas in Little Rock.
The M orning News of N orthw est A rkansas reported over
the w eekend that seven letters were sold to a dealer in Utah
and that others were sold to a dealer in Lawrence. Police would
not discuss details.
O ther docum ents may have been sold to A rkansas dealers,
the paper reported.
The m aterials missing from KU included three letters signed
by William Quantrill, a guerrilla leader who sacked Lawrence
in 1863. The Q uantrill letters, w ritten from 1855 to 1860, were
the basis of the felony charge against Smith.
A lso m issing are letters signed by P resident G rover
Cleveland; by E m m ett D alton, part of a gang that plagued
Kansas in the late 1800s; and by Kansas Gov. Thom as Carney,
writing to President A braham Lincoln.
Kansas University Police Sgt. Chris Keary said anyone who
might have stolen docum ents would not likely face charges if
they contacted police.
“If you came to us, that would be a lot different than if w e’ve
found you,” Keary said.
Smith faces a hearing at 1:45 p.m. M arch 18 in Douglas
County District Court. H e rem ained M onday in the Douglas
County Jail on $10,000 bond.

A lthough it may seem that student governm ent is not on the side of the students, but instead
on the side of the adm inistration, they are not.
Student governm ent is totally on the side of the students. Student body president Ramon
Blakley said student governm ent does not support the proposed $35 parking sticker increase for
next year.
“We supported the first bond they came to us with,” Blakley said. “We are supportive of the
$10 per year increase.”
Blakley underotands that students are very concerned with this issue and hopes that students
will attend the next student governm ent m eeting scheduled for tomorrow, March 15, in the
Tower Lake Com mons M ulti-Purpose room at 2:30 p.m.
“The students need to show a unified support with their dissatisfaction with the proposed
parking sticker increase,” Fabian Wright, vice president of student governm ent, said.
The proposal that has students and faculty alike in an uproar is the new bond proposal that
could increase parking sticker prices by $55 dollars across the board.
The proposal would m ake im provem ents to Tower Lake Housing lots, roads and many
lighting and emergency phone enhancem ents.

James Earl Little II

e

Steve McLean

I, James E arl Little II, strongly believe that I am qualified for this
position of Vice President. I am presently a Student Senator,
Treasurer of G reek Council, M entor in the Student M entoring
Association, and an all-around active student here on campus. 1 am
also participating in the Student Leadership Developm ent
Program, in which I have com pleted half of the am ount of modules
required to graduate with a special certificate. A ttending these
m odules and being a Student Senator has developed my leadership
skills to a level that surpasses others.
If elected to Vice President, I will attend all Student Senate
meetings, oversee all office hours of Senators, preside over Student
Senator meetings, serve no less than ten office hours a week,
perform all the duties and responsibilities of Student Body Vice
President, and most of all com m unicate with my fellow students.

I, Steve M cLean, currently serve on the board of directors of a
non-profit agency involved in such projects as H ead Start, Meals
On W heels and flood victim relief. 1 have also served as president
of several Parent-Teacher Associations and headed many youth
organizations. I am m arried and have six children.
There are some areas at this university that I would like to focus
my attention on. I recall that my first days on campus were
terribly confusing, almost frightening. I can’t imagine what it must
be like for a young person. Therefore, I feel that the new m entor
program is one of the most vital student associations on our
campus.
As the Vice-President of the Student Body I will focus my
attention on student problems. I will work to im prove the student
related custom er service activities on campus.

Mark Hunter

My nam e is M ark H unter. It is my
intent to serve as a student senator for
SIU E. I feel that I am amply qualified,
and would perform my duties
satisfactorily.

Sean Pohl
I, Sean Pohl, believe that I am the best candidate for the
position of Student Trustee. I have already exhibited my
ability to work with a diverse student body and address their
needs through the different positions that I have served in. I
would like to continue my service o f the student body in the
position of Student Trustee.
If 1 am elected to Student Trustee, S IU E students will be
guaranteed that their voice will be heard and their interests
represented. A s Student Trustee I will be accessible to
students and the organizations that students are part of. I will
also provide a prom pt response of board actions to the
students so that they are b etter inform ed about their
university. It is also im perative that students are given m ore
opportunities to get involved with activities in the university.
This is why 1 would appreciate your vote for Student Trustee.

I am a twenty-five year old native of
G ranite City, II. I have served in the
U nited States Army, with my duties
including operation H urricane R elief in
Florida and O peration

Africa. My life travels have taken me to
forty-five states and ten countries. I
have lived in white communities,
A frican-A m erican communities, and
Hispanic-Am erican communities. I feel
these experiences will help me reach
intelligent decisions regarding my
duties as a student senator.
It gives me great pleasure to have the
opportunity to pursue this office, and I
look forw ard to serving the student
body of SIU E.

Kelley Jones
Hello, student body and faculty. I am
Kelley Jones, a freshm an at SIU E.
C urrently I am active in the Student
Leadership D evelopm ent Program , a
m em ber of the Black Student
Association, and I have served as a
chairperson for several com m ittees
here at the University. With these
experiences I possess the right qualities
for a student senator. By being a
student senator, this is just one of my
goals of becoming m ore involved at the
university. With my great
com m unication skills, I can express the
ideas and concerns of the student body.
If 1 am elected as a student senator I
plan to represent my fellow students
with great dedication to get the job
done. Therefore your vote for Kelley
Jones as one of your future student
senators will go towards som eone who
will be com m itted to the student body
and helping the executives of student

job.

Antonio Stephens
Hello, my nam e is A ntonio Stephens,
and I am a junior m ajoring in Biology. I
am currently serving as a m em ber of the
Student Senate and Finance Board. A t
the beginning of the 1995-96 academic
year, Student G overnm ent m ade a
pledge to stam p out apathy at SIU E.
W e’re holding true to that pledge. In the
upcoming 1996-97 academ ic year, the
pledge to stam p out apathy at SIU E
must continue. If re-elected as a Student
Body Senator, I will push to continue
the pledge. I will continue to utilize my
experience to ensure that the senate
continues to m ake effective and logical
decisions throughout the academ ic year,
the recruitm ent num bers for students
serving on the University-wide
Com m ittees continue to be a
representation of the student body, and
that the Finance B oard continues to
m ake the process for approving request

Sheri Williams
My nam e is Sheri Williams and I am
currently from St. Louis, Mo. I am a

the Constitutions Review Com m ittee
and the H onorable Degrees and

that serving on these com m ittees has
helped me become familiar with the
ways Student G overnm ent works. If
elected, the goals that I will concentrate
on are how to help im prove campus life,
to achieve a higher graduation rate, and
to represent all students. This is why I
feel that I will prove to be an excellent
Student Senator for the 1996-97 school
year.

My nam e is Joe A rana. I am a
sophom ore m ajoring in Biology. I am a
m em ber of A lpha K appa Lam bda and
hold the office of secretary. I will work
for the issues that you and I are
concerned with. Some of my concerns
are the long lines at the B ursar’s office,
student work and financial assistance
(that continually loses paperw ork
because of lack of professional support)
and I am also concerned with repeated
increases in parking passes on a yearly
basis; totally based on èver changing
adm inistration dogma. Policy changes
and fee increases during the sum m er
when most of the student body is not
present is another concern of mine.
Vote for me because it is time for a
change.

Thursday, March 14, 1996

Being a candidate for Student Senate, I,
B randon Lorton feel that my interest in
Student G overnm ent and proper
student representation m ake me a top
candidate. 1 am an undergraduate
student in the nursing program , a class
representative, and 1 have three and one
half years in the military with leadership
experience. I am currently em ployed as
a Wellness Program Assistant. This
allows me to be in constant interaction
with students and to hear their
problem s and concerns. A lthough issues
such as the parking fee increase, the
unfinished rem odeling project at Tower
Lake A partm ents, and the condition of
the roads on campus are im portant, this
will not be my entire focus. I am
interested in advancing the quality of
the collegiate experience of all SIU E
students by focusing on issues im portant
in achieving academic excellence and
justified use of student funds. Please
show your support and cast your vote
for me on M arch 19 and 20. Thank you.

My nam e is R obert M um phard, Jr., an
interested candidate for Student Senate.
I am currently seeking a B achelor’s
degree in Business A dm inistration with
specialization areas being in MIS and
M anagem ent. My current status at
S IU E is a 3.250 GPA. Being a transfer
student from Jackson State University, I
found SIU E to have the essential
ingredients to further my academic
career. These assets include: dynamic
faculty and staff, diversity in career
choices, various student organizations,
and updated technological equipm ent,
and interesting student
activities/programs.
I truly hope that my participation in

Heather Rulo

My nam e is Bill A nderson, many of you
probably rem em ber my colum n in the
A lestle last year. I have decided to run
for Student Senator because I want to
see SIU E shed its com m uter college
image and move on to better things. I
believe the way to m ake S IU E b etter is
to improve campus life and strengthen
the G reek system. I am a sophom ore
and a m em ber of A lpha K appa Lam bda
fraternity. Last year, I served on the
University Housing Advisory
Com m ittee and the University C enter
D irector Search Com mittee. If elected, I
will m ake it my personal goal to
improve campus life at SIU E.

I, Lam ont Blankston, have decided to
run for the office of Student Senator to
provide accurate representation, and
prom ote the general welfare of the
student body.

I, H eath er Rulo, being both a
Chancellor’s Scholar and the Treasurer
of A lpha Sigma Tau sorority have
experienced many facets of college life
here at SIUE. I feel I can do an excellent
job representing the student body during
the 96 -9 7 term. I strongly feel that this
campus needs to pull together in a more
cohesive group to battle the strong
apathy that is ever present. I know that
this situation will not change over night,
but with the right people working hard,
it can be resolved. I know that I am the
right person. With your vote, I will be
able to work towards that goal.

Demetre Pegues
Hello, my nam e is D em etre A. Pegues
and I am interested in filling one of the
Student Senator positions. A lthough I
currently serve as a Student Senator, I
know it is im portant that I continue to
represent the needs of all students and
not just certain groups. If elected to
serve this position, I will continue to
prom ote diversity and m ake the campus
m ore unified. I will also continue to get
students m ore involved with the
decision-m aking process at the
University. As a senator, I know I can
not please everybody, but I will do
everything possible to help ou t as much
as I can. Being a m em ber of D elta
Sigma T heta Sorority, Inc., the
Organization for M inority Business
Students (OM BS), SLDP, plus a variety
of o th er university-wide com m ittees, I
feel I have made, and continue to m ake
a com m itm ent to the SIU E community.
Your vote and support will be greatly
appreciated.

Being a second year student here at
SIU E, I have seen the opinions of the
student body ignored by the
adm inistrative staff. In order to turn this
situation around, I plan to represent the
voices and views of the student body. I
would m ake certain that all students
(African Americans, Whites,
International, H andicapped, Night
students, and others) issues are heard
prior to any policy effecting us, rather
than afterw ards when nothing can be
done. I believe in taking advantage of all
privileges and opportunities surrounding
me. I do not believe in the practice of
apathy. Involvem ent on campus is
extrem ely im portant. My experience as a
m em ber of the Black Student
Association, Gospel Choir,
Personnel/Public R elations Board,
Financial Aid Advisory and the new
M entoring Program all will assist me in
carrying out the duties of a Student
Senator. I, C harm ayne White, will
execute all the duties of Student Senator
to the best of my ability if chosen in the
‘96 election.

Nicole Watson
My nam e is Nicole Watson, I am a
sophom ore at SIU E and my m ajor is
social work. As a student senator I feel I
would be a valuable asset to the student
body. I feel that students need a person
to keep them inform ed on all issues
discussed in senate meetings and on
adm inistrative levels. If elected, I will do
my best to address all the concerns of
the student body and update them on
m atters that effect them. I am currently
participating in Student Leadership
D evelopm ent Program. I also serve on
the Cam pus Life com m ittee, and I am
active in o th er student organizations. I
am a hard worker, active in com m unity
service, and have developed strong
com m unication and listening skills. In
the position of senator I feel I will excel
and benefit the university as a whole.

comedy, handsom e lothario A rt Dodge (A ntonio Banderas) is a good-natured but
down-in-the-heels art gallery ow ner struggling to stay one step ahead of the
creditors. D eterm ined to keep his business afloat, A rt finds himself reduced to
scamming the widowed spouses of recently-deceased men into paying for paintings
allegedly purchased by their late better-halves. However, when he m akes an ill-timed
business call at the hom e of a reputed mob-boss, A rt finds himself chased off the
property and into the arms of Betty K erner (M elanie Griffith), who happens to have
been twice m arried and divorced from the m ob-boss’ son G ene (D anny Aiello).
Not only is Betty a beauty, she’s also rich. W hen she quickly falls for the dashing
A rt and sets her sights on m aking him husband num ber three, h e’s only too happy to
go along for the ride to Easy Street. T hat is, until he gets there and m eets B etty’s
equally beautiful sister Liz (Daryl H annah), with whom he falls instantly in love.
Now, not wishing to lose either woman, A rt comes up with a desperate plan. In a
m om ent of panic he creates a whole new persona for himself, in the form of a longlost twin bro th er nam ed “B art.” B art is then free to pursue Liz, while A rt himself
proceeds with the arrangem ents for his m arriage to Betty.
An outrageous charade ensues and pandem onium prevails as A rt/B art, in order
to date Betty and Liz simultaneously, nearly spins out of his mind keeping characters
straight. It’s a revolving door of com edy and chaos in Touchstone Pictures comedy,
“Two M uch.” Joan Cusack and Eli Wallach also star.

I just love St, P atrick’s Day! It’s the
one day of the year that I get to run
around dem anding guys to “kiss me!
I’m Irish!” and one has to love that
green beer, but th ere’s a lot m ore to it
than that.
This holiday, contrary to what
some may believe, was not created by
a bunch of party-crazed college
students who felt it necessary to
create an entire day devoted to
getting ham m ered. T here really was a

leprechauns are apparently mean,

St. Patrick’s Day was first

corned beef and cabbage and that

AMC has new things brewing
in character and story lines
By Roy Gilmore
Editor in Chief
Man, things are popping off in little ole Pine Valley!
First of all, poor Taylor has gone crazy. I wish they could’ve come up
with a better plot for her, but this one is kinda funny because I have
actually seen people this sick like her.
As you know, she is infatuated with Noah and she is trying to do
anything to get together with him. But first let me catch you up on why
she is trying to get back with him.
See, she lied on the stand and got Noah sentenced to something like
five years in prison. Well, everyone knew she was lying except for Derek
Frye, but that’s because he wanted to bang Taylor one more time and you
know how that can cloud your judgement.
Well after he was sentenced, she tried to help him escape but Noah
was one step ahead of Taylor and had Julia waiting for him so they could
both escape together. Well, that’s really when Taylor lost it and that
pretty much brings you up to date with that situation.
Except Noah and Julia are now in Jamaica running from the police
and Taylor is trying to gei there to get Noah to leave Julia. Some people
just can’t take no for an answer.
Tad and Dixie are back together again after Trevor’s wife, Laurel, was
killed on the set of “The Cutting Edge.” Dixie blamed Tad and told him
she never wanted to see him again. But after they arrested Jason, the guy
who is in love with Dixie and hates homosexuals, he called her with his
one phone call and she came to talk to him.
He then blamed her for having a gay friend and for not leaving Tad for
him and that she was part of the reason for him killing Laurel, even
though the bullet was really for her gay brother Michael. Well, after Dixie
was called a killer, she realized exactly what she sounded like and she
apologized to Tad. And silly Tad accepted her apology.
But little does Dixie know, Tad was banging Liza Colby, his boss, while
they were fighting (you know a soap wouldn’t be soap unless there was a
little adultery going on).
Meanwhile, Adam is still trying to win over Brooke’s love but Pierce
Riley has been in Brooke’s life at the same time. Janet saw Brooke and
Riley going at it and her alter ego started coming back to her and she
began talking to herself. It’s a shame that they actually don’t have a better
plot for her. She was so evil back in the day and now they tried to make
her change into somebody nice. She won’t be on the show too long so
they’ll just have to find another bad person to bring back to Pine Valley.
Future predictions: Look for Taylor to finally get caught with all the
lies and finally snap. Edmond and Maria will get into a big fight about the
baby and then Kelsey’s gonna suddenly want it back. Noah and Julia will
turn themselves into the law and not get punished (this is TV, it can
happen). And finally, look for Erica to have to choose between Demetri
or Dr. Kinder. Her choice might surprise you.

It was fun in the sun for the S IU E
baseball team over the break when they
ventured down South to Fort Meyers, Fla.
and Valdosta, Ga.
The Cougars played eleven games in a
nine day span where they recorded a 9-3
record to start off the season plus a national
ranking of eighth.
Playing two tough opponents right off the
bat in ranked team s of Valdosta State and
Tampa, the Cougars looked to have their
w ork cut out for them.
But the Cougars came out of G eorgia
with a split by defeated Tam pa, who is
currently ranked fourth in the nation.
Then the team m ade it down to Florida
where one of their victories was against
defending national cham pion and then No. 1
ranked Florida Southern.
“T hat w eek show ed us w hat we are
capable of doing. We played pretty well but
you have too to beat those teams,” H ead
C oach G ary Collins said W ednesday
afternoon about his team s’ play.
W hat really stood out over the break was
the good pitching. For the first 12 games the
Cougars have a com bined earn run average
(E R A ) of 2.35.
“We had great pitching. All eight guys
pitched great. If I had to single out one guy
it would be (Eric) M umma,” Collins said.
M umma went 2-0 with a E R A of 1.05 in
17 innings pitched.

Pitchers Ryan Cox and Jason G uest also
put in good perform ances combining for a 20 record and a E R A under 1.00.
H ittin g for th e C ougars was about
average as a whole. Jeff Silvey lead the way
with a .425 b attin g average with B rian
Geluck and M ark Burris right behind him.
“We hit fair but it was enough and it was
timely. B urris and G eluck had an
outstanding trip and Silvey is leading the
team in m ost categories but I expected him
to do that. B ut the o ther two surprised me.”
“We will im prove offensively as we go
along and o ur hitting will get better,” Collins
said.
Burris, besides batting .395, stole a teamleading seven bases and Geluck batted an
even .400 for the trip.
The Cougars will get their chance to
prove them selves at the plate as they go up
against some of the nations best in their next
six games.
“The rankings just came out and had us
eighth. B ut for the next six straight games we
will be playing against ranked opponents. So
it is not going to be easy,” Collins said.
For those w ho follow the Cougars
schedule there has been some m inor changes
in some upcoming games. Friday’s game with
W estern Illinois University will be played at
G ranite High School’s field at 2p.m.
T hen S atu rd ay ’s d o ubleheader against
22nd ranked Southern Indiana becomes a
road contest. Sunday’s doubleheader against
Quincy, at Quincy, rem ains the same.

Bjf Andÿ /Coritsm&gar
Well, Cougar fans, the S IU E basketball season
has come to an end. This means, of course, that the
C ougar C orner m ust close out it’s inaugural season.
I’d like to thank all who gave interviews and read the
Cougar Corner. I hope you have enjoyed it. So, to
close out the year, I’ve selected my M VC’s (M ost
Valuable Cougar) for the season. So read on and I’ll
see you all next year...In the Corner.
I picked Jason H olm es because he was the
Cougars go-to-guy this year. Jason’s coach, Jack
M argenthaler, sum m ed up his confidence in Jason
best when he said, “H e m ade last second shots to win
games against Quincy and Indianapolis. W hen the
games on the line, h e’s the m an.”
Jason was the m an on many occasions for the
Cougars. H e scored twenty or m ore points seven
times this year and thirty or m ore on three occasions.
His high point total for the year was 38 against
Quincy.
The sharp shooting guard from New Castle, Ind.,
averaged just over 18 points a game this year. While
these num bers are impressive enough, rem em ber
that Jason was a m arked m an all year. The other
team s always focused on stopping Jason. If they
couldn’t do it with brains, they som etimes used
brawn.
“I got a little beat up over the season,” Holmes
said. “I’ll work hard with the weights in the off
season and that will be a big factor come next
season.”
A lthough Jason’s skills are very impressive, I most
adm ire his heart. W hen asked w hat his m ost
m em orable m om ent on the court was this season, he
didn’t even talk about his game winning shots or
impressive offensive numbers.
H e said, “ It was probably watching John Pruett
receive his award. It was good just to see him back
on the court.”
We all look forward to seeing you on the court
next season, Jason.

"M ost l/aéaa¿fe, C o n o rs”

I picked Terri Evans because she put up some
impressive offensive numbers. She lead the team in
scoring with 16 points per game. She also lead the
team in assist and steals per game averaging almost
5.5 assists and 2.5 steals p er game.
Terri is the school’s record holder for career
points, three point attem pts and three pointers
made.
Terri’s experience, speed, and ball handling skills
are just as im portant to her team as her offensive
output.
“O ur press offense is to just give Terri the ball and
watch out,” head coach Wendy H edberg said. “She
sees the floor so well.”
Terri likes the pressure.
She said, “I like handling the ball. W hen I see an
open space 1 just react and try to find a team m ate.”
Evans has energized fans at the V adalabene
C enter for four years and while her days of wearing
the red and white are over, Terri doesn’t plan on
hanging up her high-tops just yet.
“I just enjoy playing,” she said. “I play in the
Prairie State Games. I guess I’m just a gym rat. It
hasn’t really hit me yet that my playing days are
over.”
We’ll all miss watching Terri launching those
bombs from behind the arc. Coach H edberg agrees.
“A fter four years I knew what to expect out of
her. She was fun to watch,” she said.
Thanks for the m em ories Terri.
I chose Chris Harris because o f his consistency.
Chris hasn’t been in the Cougar C orner all year, yet
he is second on the team in scoring and free throw
percentage. A nd leads the team in blocks, rebounds
and shot an amazing 71 percent from the floor.
These num bers are even m ore impressive when
you consider that Chris doesn’t even start. Coach
M argenthaler said he was very im pressed with
H arris’ play off the bench.
“H e accepted it quite well. H e played better

coming off the bench and we w anted to protect him
because of his asthm a so he could get the most
production out of his minutes,” he said.
A nd produce he did. It seem ed like whenever the
Cougars needed a wake-up call, the high riser would
sweep by for a vicious block or thunderous jam.
H arris stands only 6-foot-4 but took second place in
a slam -dunk contest in high school.
Harris was a hum an highlight film before the
game when he would show his arsenal of aerial
moves to the crowd at the V.C. His high flying style
even caught the attention of his coach.
“I was m ost im pressed with the alley-oop he
caught form Holloway. The pass was almost outside
the backboard and he took it out of the defenders
hands and dunked it. That was one of the most
spectacular dunks I’ve ever seen,” M argenthaler
said.
It was indeed a very athletic play, but I think
w e’ve only just begun to see what H arris can do.
I picked Alicia Harkins because of things that
d o n ’t stand out on a stat sheet. Aside from being
second on th e team in field goal percentage,
rebounds, and points, H arkins was the heart and soul
of the Cougars team . Alicia came into this season
afte r injuring h er k nee during h er sophom ore
season.
She didn’t miss a beat though as she led the
Cougars in scoring the first game of the season with
18 points.
H arkins only stands 5-foot-10 but had to bang
down low at times for the C ougars and th at’s
som ething coach H edberg would like to see change
for next season.
“She’s not afraid of anyone, but she’s not a true
back to the basket player. I’d like to play her at the

well,” said head coach Sandy M ontgomery. “We
m ade a lot of progress throughout the week. We
lacked confidence early in the tournam ent, but
showed a lot of prom ise as the week went on.”
The offense was led by Jennifer Smith, who batted
.455, had nine R B I and hit three out of the park
during the week.
Junior Michele Sucich and sophom ore D eanna
Smith each had eight RBI and two hom e runs. O ne of
Sucich’s blasts was a grand slam. D eanna Smith also
had a record of 3-1 on the mound.
“We
have
trem endous
p o ten tial,”
said
Montgomery. “We still have a long way to go, but we
played like a team . I could see the difference from
the first day to the last day.”
O n the defensive side, junior Kim D arrow was
solid at catcher, throwing out 10 of 12 attem pted base
stealers during the tournam ent.
“I knew she was good, but she is better than I
thought,” said M ontgomery.
SIU E will host the C ougar Classic this w eekend at
the Collinsville Sports Complex. The 12 team tourney
will start Friday with the Lady Cougars battling

take people off the dribble,” she said.
As far as Alicia’s goals for next season goes, she
wants to see m ore team success.
“We should win 20 games next year. Everyone
will be m ore dedicated. People want to win and
were going to do som ething about it,” H arkins
said.
I hope the rest of the girls are as m otivated as
Alicia, it should be an exciting year.

A hhhh, that wonderful time of year is here again.
Yes, that beautiful time of year when hundreds of
young m en are preparing to go dancing.
No, I’m not referring to upcoming senior proms
or anything like that. W hen the men I’m referring to
lace up their dancing shoes its a whole new kind of
dancing shoe. It’s a high-top, rubber-soled shoe that
is the only shoe acceptable for this dance because its
no ordinary dance, its “The Big Dance.”
Oh yeah, what a glorious time of year it is, it is
that two and a half week period that most people
call “M arch Madness,” but I like to refer to it as
“March H appiness” because anyone who has any
interest in college basketball can only be filled with
happiness to see 63 games in 19 days.
O f course by now you know that I’m talking
about the N CAA tournam ent which after a long
regular season, finally begins today.
This year, the tournam ent appears as though it
could be one of the best ever, as any one of a
num ber of team s could get hot at the right time and
go all the way to the championship.
B reaking it down by bracket, trying to predict the
final four is no easy task, but I’ll give it a try.
First, in what I see as the toughest bracket, the
Southeast. The top-seeded Connecticut has been
impressive all season long and won both the Big
East regular season and tournam ent titles-not an
easy task in that very tough conference.
Connecticut will face some stiff com petition
though in the southeast from team s such as Georgia
Tech, Cincinnati, Mississippi St. and the defending
National Champions, UCLA.
It will be a tough road, but I think the Huskies
will survive and play at the Meadowlands.
In the East, the road to the M eadowlands will
probably be a contest between M assachusetts and
G eorgetow n, but neither can be overconfident
because past cham pions, N orth C arolina and

^

o

u

Arkansas, will be waiting for their chance at an
upset.
I
see Allen Iverson will be leading the H.oyas
over top-ranked UM ass for the right to move on.
In the M idw est, m any p eo p le’s to u rn am en t
favorite, Kentucky, seems like the clear-cut favorite.
H ow ever, a bad shooting night like they
experienced last year against N orth Carolina could
cost them and give eith er Wake Forest or Villanova
the chance to sneak into the Final Four.
W ith th at said, I ’ll tak e my chances with
Kentucky.
Finally, the West, w here Big Ten cham p Purdue
holds the top seed. However, as you fill out your
brackets for your office pools rem em ber, when in
doubt, always bet against the Big Ten. Therefore,
do n ’t expect Purdue to go too far. M emphis or
Syracuse will upset them in the Sweet 16.
This leaves the road to New Jersey open for
Kansas, and the Jayhawks will tak e advantage of the
opportunity.
So its C o nnecticut against K ansas and
G eorgetow n against Kentucky.
This sets up a Special K final as Kansas and
K entucky will advance and square off for the
cham pionship in a b attle of two great young
coaches, Roy Williams and Rick Pitino.
The game presents an interesting battle with
Jayhawk point guard, Jacque Vaughn, trying to
handle the devastating K entucky press.
A lthough Vaughn should be able to handle the
pressure p retty well, the W ildcats are just too
talented and will take hom e the trophy.
Well, if predicting the tournam ent was only this
easy I could be a rich man, but then of course the
surprises are what m akes this time of year so
exciting and so fun.
Sit back and enjoy everyone, the fun is about to
begin.
