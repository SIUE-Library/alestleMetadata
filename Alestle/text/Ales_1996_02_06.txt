A n estim ated 50 students gathered in the G oshen Lounge Thursday afternoon
to listen to a panel of speakers who spoke on the im portance of black history.
The speakers were a part of a series of Black History M onth events that will be
celebrated throughout the m onth of February.
“It is difficult to understand history of the U nited States without the history of
Black A m erica,” Dr. Jam es Jackson, professor of special education at Southern
Illinois University at Edwardsville said.
Jackson went on to say that people can’t rem em ber the struggle of the AfricanA m erican people w ithout meaningful ideas. The struggle for hum anity was not an
easy one.
“R osa Parks did not sit down and refuse to move so that we could continue
sitting in the back of the bus,” Jackson added.
C hristopher N ance, president of the Black Student Association, answered the
question ‘W hat is black history?’ through his speech.
“Black history, to me, is a product of the sickness of Am erica. T he im portance
of black history is vital to humanity, not just to black people but to all races”
Nance said.

letter to the editor—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ —--------------- —

Shallow minded letters misinterpret Lincoln's actions
This letter is a response to the shallow m inded
letters to the editor published Tuesday, Jan. 30. In
those letters, bits and pieces of the Em ancipation
Proclamation and other speeches by A be Lincoln
were cited to try and accuse Lincoln of ridiculous,
unproved motives for advocating freedom of the
slaves. They spoke as if som e dem ented
interpretation can denounce A braham Lincoln of
any respect he deserves and that there shouldn’t be a
holiday for him.
I
respect
Dr.
K ing’s
m onum ental
accomplishments but to insult A be Lincoln and call
Christopher Columbus a “thief and an exploiter” in
the same letter shows a m ajor mix up! Slandering
A be L incoln is like calling your m other an
irresponsible vagabond after she carried you in her
stomach for 9 m onths, went through labor and
changed your diapers for you for two years! Such
disrespect is em barrassing and sad.
O f course, A be Lincoln was hum an like we are.
He had to deal with the sticky procedures and
protocol of political persuasion in order for his plan
for equality to work. W hen he spoke of equal rights,
he m eant for all m en—not just for blacks or whites.
His classic question that stirred voter’s m oral values
was, “Is slavery right? O r w rong?”
According to A nthony Smith, who w rote the
letter in the Alestle on Jan. 30, in Peoria when
Lincoln said his “own feelings would not adm it of
making slaves politically and socially equal; and if
they would, we well know that the great mass of
white people will not . . . ” was proof that Lincoln
never intended for slaves to have equality. T hat is his
biased and thoroughly mistaken opinion! Lincoln

w asn’t talking about himself. H e was talking about
the bulk of the white people at that time. If Lincoln
didn’t care about the slaves being given equal rights
(like A nthony Smith claims) he would have argued
that all states allow slavery to save the nation—like
m any other politicians did.
H e said his own feelings would not “adm it” of
political equality. “A dm it.” Why would he voice his
true feelings about political and social equality in a
speech to an Am erican people who were having a
hard time even considering the idea of freeing the
slaves? They would have freaked out!
His control with statem ents like this is part of his
great wisdom that allowed him to get to the position
where he was despite his views that slavery is against
the constitution. In a time of a politically unstable
nation, that was the best way he could m ake a
difference as a leader. If Lincoln would have focused
all his attention on slave sand forgot about the
stability of the country that was happening at that
time, the slaves would not have been freed. He
would have accomplished nothing with the hard
headed Am ericans he had to deal with.
A nthony Smith says, “So what did Lincoln do
concerning slavery? Virtually nothing.” W hat? Is
this guy m ental? How can so much that was done by
one m an be so overlooked? It’s like saying that
Michael Jordan did nothing for basketball because
he once said “this sport has nothing more to offer me
right now,” and played a little baseball! The small
details left out would be the recent death of his
father that lead to this choice, his eventual return,
league
MVP,
num erous
Chicago
world
championships and more. The overlooked details

would m ake this statem ent ridiculous—just like
A nthony Sm ith’s statem ent about A braham Lincoln.
We cannot overlook all Lincoln did in his life. For
example, how he chilled thousands of voters in the
language of Biblical majesty, warning of slavery
defeating the purpose for which our founding fathers
created the government: for freedom . In 1858 he
said, “This governm ent has en d u red 82 years
because, during all that time ... the public mind did
rest ... with the belief that slavery was in course of
ultim ate extinction.” In 1863 he gave the G ettysburg
A ddress which inspired m illions in which he
reiterated his resolve to fight for a governm ent that
was “...under G od...of the people, by the people and
for the people.”
“T he p eo p le.” W ho was he talking ab o u t?
Everyone— including slaves. H e was also concerned
with the future for immigrants into the country. If
blacks were denied their rights, who else might be
denied their rights?
I w rote this letter because, despite what A nthony
Smith or anyone else says, Lincoln was a great leader
... just as M artin L u th er King. We d o n ’t need
frivolous accusations against his character because
of m isinterpretations of a few phrases. D o n ’t blame
what Am ericans did after Lincoln died on Lincoln.
Have enough sense to credit a fo refather who
overcam e great obstacles to lead the nation to
abolish slavery. H e lead our country through its
darkest years and he deserves to be defended.

letter to the editor________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Campus should stop bickering and celebrate both holidays
In response to the two letters in last Tuesday’s Alestle, I believe this campus
could take a step toward racial harm ony if we would change the focus of the
current “holiday debate.” Instead of bickering over w hether A braham Lincoln
or Dr. M artin L uther King Jr. deserves his holiday m ore, why don’t we all
celebrate both holidays? All of A m erica has benefited from the work of these
two extraordinary men.
The whole nation should be thankful for the life and work of M artin Luther
King. Segregation was an inhum an, unjust and unconstitutional system which
degraded and dehum anized everyone involved with it—white and black. King
gave his leadership, his eloquence and ultim ately his life for equality. Every
Am erican has a reason to celebrate and continue that fight.
Can one celebrate King and Lincoln with no contradiction? Absolutely. No
one will deny that Lincoln had his prejudices. The rem arkable thing about
Lincoln is that, when one reads his letters and speeches, one can see his ideas
about race and slavery evolving. H e may have begun his political life with all
the typical biases of his day, but at the end of his life he held quite a different
view.
Was the Em ancipation Proclam ation limited and slow to take effect?
Absolutely. Lincoln was a cautious m an who believed (rightly) that the
C onstitution gave the President no power to act against slavery. Lincoln was
trying to lead his nation through a dangerous and bloody Civil War (which in
1862 was not going very well). Several in Lincoln’s cabinet and his highest
ranking general believed that no Em ancipation at all should be undertaken.
Lincoln was a politician. H e could only do what was politically possible. An
im m ediate and total em ancipation would probably have gotten Lincoln
im peached, w hole U nion arm ies w ould have quit the field, and the
Confederacy would likely be intact today.
As to his private attitudes, he may have begun the Civil War wanting only to
preserve the Union. However, his attitudes changed. In his second inaugural

address, delivered just six weeks before he was killed, he gave the opinion that
the Civil War was G od’s punishm ent for the sin of slavery. In this speech, he
wished for an end to the war and then said “if G od wills that (the war)
continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-m an’s two hundred and fifty
years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and every drop of blood drawn with the
lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword ... it must be said, ‘the
judgem ents of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’” A conservative
politician would never say such a thing in an inaugural address if he didn’t
fervently believe that slavery was a great moral stain on the nation.
It is one of the tragedies of A m erican history that Lincoln was assassinated
less than a week after A ppom attox. H e never had the time to fully devote his
energies to the problem s of reuniting the nation and including the form er
slaves into the union. In all fairness, the failures of reconstruction to secure
equality for the form er slaves can not be attributed to Lincoln.
F or the form er slaves, the Civil War was not fully won until the Civil Rights
m ovem ent (led by Dr. M artin L uther King Jr. ) a hundred years later. In many
ways, the struggle is still ongoing. Lincoln and King both died with unfinished
work.
So why can’t we all, white and black, recognize both Dr. M artin L uther King
Jr. and A braham Lincoln as great A m ericans? They each, in their own times
and in their own ways, advanced the A m erican ideal of liberty, equality and
justice for all citizens. They are both worthy of a place in the pantheon of
A m erican heroes.

“ I know that there had been some problem s concerning the
way he had been running the station,” M ahoney said.
He went on to say that G erritsen had a huge block on sports
broadcasts and would not allow them to be aired. He also said
that he knew that A kers was planning on incorporating more
sports as well as other University related events into the
broadcasts.
A kers was a part of the original staff of the W SIE station
when the station first began in 1970. H e was one of the first
student volunteers at the station and was part of the play-byplay sports team.
A kers spent 15 years in the radio business, from 1972 to
1986, and w orked at W RTH 590 AM and at K EZ K 102.5 FM
as a morning news caster.
R egarding his new position, A kers said, “I feel as if my life
has come full circle. I look forward to working with students,
staff and the university. We can all be truly proud of this
university.”
A kers w ent on to say that he doesn’t plan on making
changes in how the station sounds, but he does plan on serving
the University better by covering m ore university events and
seeking m ore tie-ins with academics.
Concerning the positions of the other staff m em bers, A kers
said that everyone will be evaluated including himself and that
the station is not worrying about that situation right now.

station. He wants to do everything in his pow er to help add to
the University."
Jennifer Passig. student secretary at W SIE radio station,
said. "It (the firing of G erritsen) was really sudden. Roy left
with boxes W ednesday night, and on Thursday morning,
Sharon H ahs came in and introduced F rank and started
posting m em os on the change."
Pat Gurney, producer at W SIE. said. “ I do not know the
reasons behind G erritsen s dismissal, but the news was like a
bom b and it left others w ondering who would be the next to
go."
G urney went on to say that there had been pressure put on
G erritsen lately by the adm inistration, but that no one had any
idea that the current situation would occur.
"H e came in to talk to me the o th er day," G urney said,
"and he told me he was fired. I thought he was joking, because
w e're always kidding around. H e didn't tell me why they fired
him: in fact. I don't think they even gave him a good reason. I
think it was just personality ajid politics.”
O perations director for W SIE, Chad Mahoney, said that he
was also not given the reasoning behind G erritsen's release.

O n Thursday, Feb. 8, the

B oard of Trustees will hpld
their next scheduled meeting
at 10:30 a.m. in the Madison
R oom of the U niversity
Center.
The m eeting will cover a
num ber of issues relevant to
both the students and faculty
of SIU, including the annual
Illinois B oard of H igher
Education (IB H E ) operating
budget recommendations.
The IBHE recommendations
include a 5.3 percent increase

F o r SIU , the IB H E has
recom m ended an increase of
3.3 percent.
W hile SIU is allotted a

reason for the discrepancy
can be found within the

made to strengthen the financial position of the university.
“While asset m aintenance and em ergency funds are often the first to be cut
from budget allocation, w e’ve got to turn things around as far as investing in and
m aintaining o ur assets,” said Sanders.
The IB H E plan includes funds for the initiation of a m aster’s degree in the
Primary Care Nurse Practitioner program at SIU E. Additionally, the IB H E
recom m ends funding for student retention activities at SIUE. Those activities
would be geared toward enhancing the graduation rate at SIU E.
“I am absolutely convinced that there are ways we can improve retention and
maintain or even raise standards,” said Sanders.
The board will also be asked to consider Tom G urnsey as the dean of the SIU
School of Law, a position that has been vacant since July 1 of last year. A
nationw ide search for the position found G urnsey at the University of
Richmond w here he served as the associate dean of the University of Richm ond

School of Law. G urnsey served at R ichm ond for eight years and was an intregal
part of drastic im provem ents m ade during his stay.
“We are com m itted to m aking the SIU School of Law the best small school of
law in the country. Tom has the understanding to do just th at,” Sanders said.
Also to be considered is a recom m endation to provide for SIU faculty
m em bers who were recently called to duty in Bosnia. T he recom m endation calls
for the university to extend both salary and benefits to the three faculty
m em bers affected so they w on’t have reduced benefits or com pensation, Sanders
said.
In addition, the board will be asked to consider the disposition of unused
property located at the School of D ental M edicine.
“The property could be converted to residential use, benefitting both the
state and us,” Sanders said.
The board will also be asked to revise the current Joint R ules G overning
Procurem ent and Bidding at State Systems Universities in Illinois in o rd er to
bring policies in line with state laws.

Criminal Defacement

Burglary from a Motor Vehicle

On Jan. 30, at 7:35 a.m., a student from Tower Lake reported
someone broke the door handle off the driver’s door of his car

The Mad Hoosier: A show within a show
By Jennifer Casey
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
Im agine applying for a job and being told that in
order to get the job, you have to get a stick, pretend
that you’re arthritic, and find a stranger that will
scratch not only your back with the stick, but your
backs/de as well. This m ay send som e people
screaming,, but for the m an affectionately term ed
the “M ad Hoosier," this was only the first in a series
of wacky stunts that are just part of his job as a
radio personality on W K BQ -FM ’s Steve and D.C.
m orning show.
The M ad Hoosier, whose real nam e and age is
top secret inform ation, is not only one of the area’s
most entertaining on-air personalities, but is one
hell of a nice guy. My initial encounter with “the
H oos” occurred when he popped into the room
that guests of the Steve and D.C. show wait in prior
to going on the air and offered us coffee. He
proceeded to stop in every 15 or 20 m inutes to
m ake sure we were entertained, bringing copies of
a D ecem ber issue of the R iverfront Times, in which The Mad Hoosier (no, his Momma didn't name him
he was featured in a story about people with odd that) makes the cover of the Riverfront Times.

jobs. His is one job that can definitely be classified
as odd
A fter the show, H oos gave me his business card
that proudly advertised two of his famous sayings:
“You Know It, Partner,” and “The Rang-DangDoo.” P artner (pronounced “pot-nah” in Hoos
language) is the universal word that he uses when
addressing people.H e said that it saves him from
messing up p eo p le’s nam es and m aking them mad.
It allows him to relate to everyone. No one,
however, can explain the “R ang-D ang-D oo” quite
like the M ad H oosier can, so I w on’t even try.
The H oos has played a; vital part in many of
Steve and D.C.’s antics, including one that they
played on form er K SH E m orning radio personality
A sher “Sm ash” Benrubi that involved sneaking the
H oos into the K SHE studio in a refrigerator box
and then having him bust out of the box live on the
air, screaming the praises of Steve and D.C.
Going into the interview, I expected the Hoos to
look and act like a bonafide redneck, but the man
I m et was anything but. So what if part of his job
included, at one point, going to IH O P wearing just
his underwear, a shirt and shoes? We should all be
so lucky!

Some call him one of the greatest A frican-A m erican orators-and
for good reasons. Frederick Douglass has been a symbol of social voice
through the decades. Born around 1818 , Frederick Augustus W ashington
Bailey lived his early years as a slave in M aryland.
In 1838, the young Douglass fled to reach freedom in
Massachusetts, w ere he dropped his two middle nam es and changed his last
nam e to escape from his form er slave owners. While there he held a num ber
of jobs including a caulker (som eone who m akes ships w atertight), a
collector of rubbish, and as a cellar digger. In all these jobs, Douglas felt the
pain of segregation and discrimination.
In 1841, Douglass spoke about what freedom m eant to him to an
audience of the M assachusetts Anti-slavery Society. The group was so
impressed by Douglass, they hired him to speak about his experiences about
being a slave. Douglass spoke out on such issues as slavery, segregation
seating on trains, the discrim ination in churches where African-A m ericans
could only take part in service only after the whites services was com pleted.
Douglass hom e also served as part of the U nderground Railroad.
D uring the Civil War, Douglass helped recruit African-A m ericans
for the Union Army. D uring his lat6r years he continued to serve the
U nited States as R ecorder of D eeds in the D istrict of C olum bia and as U.S.
m inister to Haiti.
Douglass’s' anti-slavery stance was a inspiration to millions on
Americans. Born a slave, Douglass lived a life where he not only im proved
his life but helped im proved African-A m ericans and for this the Alestle
salutes Frederick Douglass.

Q104
w orking h ere...it’s just like
working with my brothers and
sister...there’s nothing to do
with sex involved; with
working h ere,” com m ented
Landrum when asked what it
was like to be a w om an
involved with the Steve and
D.C. show. “O ne thing that
bugs me is that after the show
we always get in these
discussions about whatever; it
could be som ething silly, but
for some reason they always
pile on me and Kim to ask us
about sex!” she added.
“Well I love to talk about
it, so I’ll answer any questions
they have...she’s right when
she (L an d ru m ) says that
w e’re all like brothers and
sisters because everybody
asks me, ‘how do you take
some of the crap that they
give you?’...but it’s just like
your b ro th ers giving you
crap,” said Furlow, adding her
insight into the situation.
Four others m ake up the
Steve and D.C. crew. D an
Duffy serves not only as
M aster of Sports News, but
often doubles as an object of
Steve and D.C.’s lighthearted
“abuse.” Duffy handles such
treatm ent with ease, erasing
the “jo c k ” stereotype that
sports
re p o rters
are
som etim es
labeled
with.
“ In tern K eith,” the new est
m em ber of the Steve and D.C.
family, spends m ost o f his
studio time being quiet, but
when he does talk, he has a lot
to say. A ddison Clark, who is
p erh ap s the w o rld’s m ost
picked-on in tern , adds to
m any of the show ’s jokes,
w hether or not he intends to.
However, not m any people
are so dedicated to their work
th at they will risk being
arrested by sneaking into the
Super Bowl, or spend half a
day in a garbage dum pster as
part of an on-air prank. The
m an known to the St. Louis
radio world as the M ad
H oosier rounds out the Steve
and D.C. crew. His off -thewall antics often have the
crew, as well as listeners
rolling with laughter.
A lthough they m ight not
always agree on everything
(who does?) , the talented
people that m ake up the
Steve and D.C. show com pare
them selves with one big
happy family.
“If th ere’s som ething going
on that I think Steve, D.C.,
D an, Kim, will be interested
in, I’ll invite them , but
som etim es, quite honestly,
when I get outta here for the
weekend, I do n ’t want to see
them for the whole weekend,
just because I need my space
som etim es.” L andrum best
summed up group feelings on
being a family.
In five years, Steve and
D.C. see th e show being
syndicated all over the
country. Their show is a far cry
from “typical” m orning radio,
but as long as listeners keep
coming back for m ore, these
two will continue to be the
reigning kings o f m orning
radio in St. Louis .

Cougar men go wandering-bring home split
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor

Jeremy Paschall/Alestle
The Cougars w ill have revenge on their minds Thursday night at the
Vadalabene Center when they host Lewis. Earlier this season, Lewis handed
the Cougars a 78-49 loss. Wisconsin-Parkside will follow Lewis into town.

The S IU E m en’s basketball team
went wandering through Indiana last
week and picked up a win and a loss for
their efforts.
The Cougars moved their record to
8-10 and 5-8 in the G reat Lakes Valley
C onference with a 92-77 victory against
IU PU -Ft. Wayne Thursday night and a
98-73 loss at the hands o f Indianapolis
Saturday.
“It’s tough to play on the road in this
conference,”
H ead
coach
Jack
M argenthaler said M onday afternoon
in his office. “You have to feel good
with a split.”
In the Fort Wayne contest, the m en
turned in one of their best shooting
perform ances of the season as they shot
63 percent from the field.
M argenthaler said th at the team
definitely shot b etter than it has, but he
added that they were helped by the
M astadons, who didn’t play well.
The Cougar attack was led by Jason
H olm es and Tim Holloway. Holm es
scored 16 points while H ollow ay

poured in 15 on seven of eight from the
field. R onnie H enderson also played
well while fighting off foul trouble to
shoot six of six for 12 points. H enderson
led the C ougar attack on the glass with
seven rebounds.
W ith H en d erso n fighting foul
trouble, the Cougars were able to get
quality production out of reserve center
Tim T horsen, w ho finished with 11
points in 20 m inutes of action.
“Tim has the potential for m ore of
these perform ances,” M argenthaler
said. “A lthough he hasn’t got much
playing time, he has shown that he can
be effective.”
With the Thursday win under their
belt, the Cougars turned their attention
to Saturday night and a possible season
sw eep of the
G reyhounds of
Indianapolis. T he C ougars d efeated
Indianapolis earlier this season at the
V adalabene Center.
With the loss to SIU E being one of
only two conference losses for the first
place Greyhounds, they had revenge on
their minds as they brought over 2,000
fans out for support.

Track team looks
Tough time in Indiana: The Cougars drop
games to IUPU-Fort Wayne and Indianapolis
good in Knox
College Invitational
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor

By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E track team was off and running over
the weekends Yes, that is right the track team. It was
an indoor m eet at Knox College in Galesburg, 111.,
where individual perform ances where scored rather
than team perform ances.
B oth m en and wom en com peted in the event and
both placed som e very good perform ances.
For the second week in a row Colleen Casey
broke the SIU E school record in the w om en’s 1,000
m eter run.
Casey won the Prairie Fire Invitational this past
Saturday with a time of 3 m inutes 10.52'seconds.
S tudent assistant and form er S IU E runner
K aren Beach-Pond took first place and set a new
field house record in the 5,000 m eter run.
G oing down to the 3,000 m eter. Stephenie Mielke
took third place with a time of 11 m inutes 53.1
seconds and team m ate Jacqi Vazquez was right
behind her in fourth place at 12 m inute 02.2seconds.
Then in the 1500 race, Vicki Johnson took fourth
place with a time of 5 m inutes 06.6 seconds.
In the 800 m eter, K endra Neweoo placed second
with a time o f 2 m inutes 29.8 seconds.
Becky H agenbruch took first place in her heat at
the 400 m eter with team m ate Casey behind her in
second.
The final run was a 4*400 relay with Johnson,
Neweoo, H agenbruch, and Casey running the show.
They ended with a time of 4 m inutes 31 seconds.
The m en had good outings by several runners
especially by G us C oronado who doubled in the
5,000 and 3,000 m eter. H e placed first in the 5,000
with a time of 15 m inutes 27.8 seconds. Then he took
second in the 3,000 with a time of 8 m inutes 52
seconds.

Two games played in the state of
Indiana and both had the sam e
outcome. B ut the outcom es were done
in opposite fashion.
The SIU E w om en’s basketball team
last Thursday w ent up against IU PU Fort Wayne where they started slow and
their com eback fell short in the second
half. The final score: 68-64 Fort Wayne.
T hen going dow n a ways on
Interstate 69 to play Indianapolis on
Saturday where they started strong but
finished weak. The outcom e: 64-57
Indianapolis.
“Right now all we have to do is play
40 minutes of basketball and we should
be able to get back on track,” head
coach W endy H edberg said of the
w eekend games.
D uring the Fort Wayne game, the
Cougars were led by junior B eth Brown
who shot nine of nine from the field for
18 points.
The problem is th at the norm al
scorers d id n ’t score. Junior Am y
Tuetken had five points and senior Terri
Evans put in nine. Both are consistent
double figure scorers.
S ophom ore
A licia
H arkins
contributed offensively by putting in 16
points but norm ally the Cougars are
lead by four players in double figures,
besides only two.

Wrestlers get first team victory against CMSU, fall to Indiana
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter
A psyched up SIU E wrestling squad defeated C entral Missouri State by a
score of 27-21 on Thursday, but then on Saturday the Cougars fell victim to
nationally ranked Indiana, 31-16.
The V adalabene C enter housed the battle with CMSU which the Cougars won
the first five matches of the evening. A double disqualification stopped the streak
in the 167 pound weight class.
O ne of the SIU E victors was Chris McElwee, who defeated G rant H artwig in
the 118 pound weight class,14-l.
Brian A nderson slipped by D on Bills of CMSU, 6-5, in the 126 pound weight
class.
S IU E ’s Shawn Hickey rolled by Chris H eckadon in the 134 pound weight class
by a score of 7-0.
The 142 pound weight class included senior Jason Querciagrossa’s slaying of
M att Svaglic, 9-0.
William Glass of SIU E scored a victory over D an Schickel of CMSU in the 150
pound weight class, 11-2.
A nd nationally ranked Jason C arter defeated Jason M oehlm an, 3-1.
“I’m pleased with the perform ance of the team ,” said coach Larry Kristoff,
“McElwee, A nderson, Hickey, Q uerciagrossa, Glass and C arter all wrestled well.”
The num ber 13 ranked team in the nation gave the Cougars trouble on
Saturday. The undefeated Indiana Hoosiers won all but four of the matches as
they nearly doubled the score of SIUE.

please see WRESTLE, next page
Ladies.
from previous page
The Cougars were down
by 12 at half, mainly because
of the slow start, but turned it
on in the second to m ake a
game out off it.
“We were tied with 1::20
left and they came down and
one of their girls drove and
got fouled. She m ade both of
her shots then we came down
and turned it over. We were
forced to foul and th at was
it,” H edberg said about the
waning m om ents of the Fort
Wayne game.
M uch
of
the
sam e
happened in the Indianapolis
game but instead of the cold
start like th e F ort W ayne
game the Cougars came out
strong and finished weak.
Some of the norm al scores
did score this tim e with
H arkins leading with 17
points and Evans throwing in
14 but still only two in double
figures.
Even though the Cougars
did com e o u t cold, give
Indianapolis a little credit for
adjusting th eir defense to
slow their opponent down.
“They cam e out and
stepped it up on defense by
mixing it up with m an and
then some zone defense. Plus
we also m issed som e free
throw s dow n th e stretch,”
H ed b erg said ab out the
second half.
O ne o f the tough things to
take out of these two losses
w ere
th at
they
w ere
conference games. This drops
the Cougars to 7-6 in the
conference and 12-7 overall.
H ed b erg is now getting
her team ready for a m atch­
up betw een Lewis this
T hursday at hom e. The
Cougars have already beat
this team once and H edberg
says if they play a good 40
minutes they should be all
right.

eighth out of 65 runners in the 55 m eter .
Rounding it all out was the 4*400 relay with R oundcount,
Wolf, Bloemer, and Lay with a time of 3:38.9.
All and all head coach D arryl F rerker saw a lot of talent
out there and expects good things to come during the
outdoor track season.
“I feel like we will be very competitive. With people like
Colleen breaking school records and Travis just off a record,
this should be a good indication of how good we will be,”
Frerker said.

Cougars------------------------from page 14
The many fans were not
\d isap p o in le d
as
the
Greyhounds were able to
get the revenge they
sought.
The G reyhounds came
out of the gate running
and by halftime, they were
holding a 48-29 lead.
The second half was not
as
lopsided,
but
Indianapolis
still
outscored the Cougars on
their way to the 25-point
victory.
While Perrell Lucas led
the G reyhounds with 20
points, quality bench play
was a key in the victory.
Noi Chay and Kyle Shirk
each scored 16 points off
the bench and Shirk also
hauled in 10 rebounds.
M a r g e n t h a l e r
attributed the loss to his
team not com ing out
ready to play and a quality
Indianapolis team.
“ O u r shot selection
w asn’t
good
against
I n d i a n a p o l i s , ”
M argenthaler said. “ But
that was partially caused
by their tough defense.”
C hris H arris led the
C ougars with 19 points
and 11 b o ards while
N ath an
K reke
also
flourished on the inside
with 18 points and eight
rebounds. Holm es was the
only o th er C ougar in
double figures as he tallied
11, but shot just four of 13
from the floor.
“We went to Chris a lot
in the second half and he
was able to connect on
quite a few,” M argenthaler
said about the offensive
output of his 6-foot-6 back
up center.
M argenthaler did say
H a rris’ defense caused
some concern as he was
caught out of position a
few tim es and gave up
some easy baskets.
In assessing the road
trip, M argenthaler said he
thought the perform ance
o f T horsen and H a rris’
offensive
p erform ance
w ere things th e team
could build on.
The team will need to
build on them and other
things this week in order
to
avenge
a
78-49
pum m eling they took at
Lewis earlier this season.
Following Lewis into the
Vadalabene C enter will be
W isconsin-Parkside who
the Cougars defeated 8883 in overtim e Jan. 11 at
Kenosha.
