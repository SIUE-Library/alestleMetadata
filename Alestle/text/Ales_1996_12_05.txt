For the A lestle
Police arrested a 42-year-old SIU E
student who was charged with
aggravated battery to a child on
Tuesday afternoon.
The charges came after a school
nurse learned that the w om an’s 12year-old son had been beaten with an
electrical cord.
Radell F. Gibbs, an undeclared
junior, remains in custody at this time.
University News Service Director,
Sam Smith said the police arrested
Gibbs after a school nurse at the boy’s
school called U niversity H ousing,
who then called the police to file
charges.
The charge against Gibbs states
that
she
“knowingly
caused
p erm anent disfigurem ent o r great
bodily harm ” to the boy.
Dr. N arbeth E m m anuel, ViceChancellor of Student Affairs, said,
“the university will work closely with
the D e p artm en t of C hildren and
Fam ily Services to determ in e the
course of action that needs to be
taken in this m atter.”
Child abuse is often stress induced,
according to Dr. Jen n ife r H am er,
assistant professor, in the Sociology

D e p artm en t.' “Tow er L ake is a
hotbed of stress. You have lots of
students who have children and also
work, add to that, living in cram ped
quarters, it causes a lot of stress.”
Dr. H am er co ntinued, “paren ts
d o n ’t have an outlet for stress, they
do n ’t have a netw ork where they can
talk to people to deal with the stress
in th eir lives. S IU E d o esn ’t have
traditional students, we have people
who work, people who are m arried
with children, the university needs to
provide resources for them .”
“I w ould recom m end th at the
university house a resource center for
parents. T hey also need a social
w orker of some sort to help with the
stress. Som eone who can go door to
door and talk to parents, ask how
they are doing, how their children are
doing. The only problem with this
idea is it all comes down to funding.”
S tudents had d efinite opinions
when asked ab out child abuse.
“ Child abuse is anything that causes
pain th at is e ith e r physical or
em otional. W hen you act to dam age a
child’s character,” M oira Guffey, a
student pursuing a second degree in
Fine A rts, said.

The com m encem ent address will be delivered by
G ilbert Rutm an, professor in the SIU E economic

Econom ic Education. R utm an takes pride in his
selection of delivering the com m encem ent address.
“I’m very flattered and honored,” Rutm an said.
R utm an said he wants the topic of his speech to
be close-kept, but it will be student-oriented.
“I want the speech to have some type of shock

students over the years at SIU E. The speech will be
student-oriented,” Rutm an said.
R utm an, a m em ber of the faculty since 1969, has
served as chair of the economics departm ent for
seven years and is a nationally recognized
economists and consultant. He has two degrees from

N ation al------------------State and Local
Judge lifts ban on gay marriages

Legislators must disclose scholarships

H O N O L U L U (A P ) — On
Tuesday, a judge barred Hawaii
from denying m arriage licenses to gay couples in a case that has already
led Congress to allow other states to refuse to recognize such unions.
The ruling is certain to be appealed.
Kirk-Cashm ere, an attorney for three homosexual couples who sued
the state, said Circuit Judge Kevin Chang, “in a nutshell ruled that the
sex-based classification in the state’s marriage law is unconstitutional”.
Chang said the state failed to show any compelling state interest to
deny gay and lesbian couples the right to marry, Cashm ere said.
Copies of C hang’s ruling were to be distributed later Tuesday.
A spokeswom an for the conservative Family Research Council said
the ruling defies the wishes of the majority. Polls say 70 percent of
H aw aii’s residents oppose same-sex marriages.
“This ruling is a slap in the face of the Hawaiian people who have
m ade it clear that they don’t want liberal judges tam pering with society’s
foundational institutions,” Kristi Stone Ham rick said.
A n appeal of C hang’s ruling would send the case back to the Hawaii
Suprem e Court, which ruled in 1993 that denial of marriage licenses to
same-sex couples am ounted to gender discrimination under the state
constitution’s Equal Rights A m endm ent.
The state Suprem e C ourt sent the case back to a lower court to give
the state a chance to show a compelling public interest in allowing such
discrimination.

B E LL EV IL LE NEW S D E M O C R A T — The Illinois
H ouse gave overw helm ing final approval Tuesday tc
requiring disclosure of the names of university students whc
get scholarships from lawmakers — a program costing m on
than $5 million a year.
The House voted 107-3 in favor of the measure designee
to curb what the public interest lobby Common Cause am
o th er critics have described as costly abuse by stat<
lawmakers.
The vote came on changes recom m ended by Gov. Jin
Edgar to legislation approved by the G eneral Assembl;

just as enlightening as school.

— it just came in a different
form. I’ve been in “continuing

W hen you have kids, you
realize a healthy child is m ore

perfect house and you look at
those “sh o o t-em -up” flicks
with a m ore critical eye.
I finally m ade it back to

school at age 30-something.
T h ere’s a distinct advantage to
being an o lder student.
Professors take you m ore
seriously and you bring a new
dim ension to class discussions.

yesterday morning, Department

I’ll be taking my five-year-old

Most of us get wiser as we

I’ve learned to drown out the

The m eans by which RCM is being imposed
is equally problem atic. Ignoring S IU E ’s long
history of shared governance, SIU System
head Ted Sanders simply proclaim ed that
RCM would be im posed on SIUE. H e never
bothered to ask the Faculty Senate, the Staff
Senate, the Student Senate, or anyone else,
what we at SIU E thought. H e just handed it
down as a command.
If it is such a good idea, President Sanders,
why don’t you convince the Senates of its merit

I f your birthday is today: You are prone to get gypped out o f some cool
presents because you were dumb enough to be born so close to Christmas.
You’ll probably get some crappy combination gifts from cheap relatives.
Aries (March 2 1 -A p ril 19): Really, this year,
d o n ’t let Grandma hit the egg nog too hard.
H er liver is starting to resemble Bea
Arthur's head.
Taurus (April 20-May 20) Your friends are planning
something exciting for the holidays for you: an
intervention! You have a gambling problem, dammit,
and it’s time to admit it.
G enii (May 21-Aw 2ÍJ): Vie holidays are a
good d m toeto redeemedo f your evils
done throughout the year. Maybe
you could Imke when you see
old bbui people crossing the
nxulfor a d tange.
Cmar(Atie2l-.kJ\'22). Hang
up that mistletoe baby,
y o u ’re prone fo r a Xmas kiss. (A n d I ’m not
talking about creepy
Uncle Al, either
.Leo (July 23-A ug.22)
D o you have yo u r New
Year’s resolution yet? H ow
about you give the poodles in the
neighborhood a rest. Their suicide rate has
tripled since you m oved in.
Virgo (Aug.23-Sept.22): The holidays are not
an excuse fo r you to spend m oney on yourself
just because no one will buy you a present. B u y
one fo r Quato instead.
Libra (Sept. 23-O ct. 22): / sense a Grinch in
the midst. What are you going to do with all o f
those Barbies anyway? Return them to the WalMart truck where you fo u n d them.
Scorpio (Oct 23-Nou 21): Avoid your Aunt's house at
all costs this year. She’s serving smoked ham covered

with hot tar. The medication just isn’t working.
S agittariu s (N ov.22-D ec.21): The myster)
man in your life will m ake him self know n soon
Unfortunately h e ’s an e lf with bad hygiene. Bit
som e Mentos.
Capricorn (Dec.22- Jan. 19): Tired o f spending
countless nights hom e alone watching special:
like “D olly P arton’s S m o k y M ountair
Christmas with Charles M anson?” W hy not dc
something productive like decorati
y o u r neighbor's house. Oi
better yet, rem ind tht
sim p to take down hh
lights before June thii
year!
Aquarius (Jen 20-feh.l8): Tht
economic future fo r you
is n ’t very bright. H ere’i
yo u r new holiday shopping
list: gum fo r Dad, rin{.
p o p fo r Mom, and birth
control fo r little Sis.
Pisces (Feb.J9-ManJi 20): You
are about to becom e the nex,
George Bailey. But don't worry, I ’m
yo u r Clarence. I ’ve been sensing a lot o f peopU
asking fo r help fo r you. You’re troubled, bu,
d o n ’t worry, a wise m an once said, “No mar,
who has friends is a failure." Oh, who am i
kidding. L ife is one big fa t waste o f time. Whc
cares anymore, just do it. Jum p o f f that bridge
never m in d about Z u Zu's petals. Mr. Potter hat
won, the old scurvy spider. I t ’s ah
just...wait...sorry about that. Ummm...have t
Merry Christmas, Happy H anukkah, Kwanzaa.
or whatever!

Affordable Auto Insurance

By Ty Norris
Lifestyle Editor
M any A frican
countries are filled
with holidays and
festivals th at are
celeb rated
as
im p o rtan t events.
H arvest festivals
are one of the
glorious events.
These festivals,
of
which
joy,
sharing
and
thanksgiving
becom e
the
tangible fruits that
are reap ed w hen sown in the seeds of
com m itm ent and responsibility, to oneself and
to his family. Thus, K w anzaa becom es a
celebration of cultural harvest.
Kwanzaa is an A frican-A m erican holiday,
which intertw ines A frican traditions with
A m erican custom s. It is celeb rated from
D ecem ber 26 through January 1. Kwanzaa
builds on the pow er of culture and roots to
plant seeds today for the harvest o f tomorrow.
With this celebration comes a Swahili term ,
Nguzo Saba. Nguzo Saba is the term for the
seven principles of Kwanzaa, which are listed
below:
1. Um oja (Unity)
2. Kujichagulia (Self-determ ination)
3. Ujima (Collective work and
responsibility)
4. U jam aa (C ooperative Econom ics)
5. Nia (Purpose)
6. Kuum ba (Creativity)
7. Im ani (Faith)
The seven principles of Kwanzaa are more
than just m ere words, they carry a philosophy.
The principles are practical and inform ative
and they are tailored to the celebrants way of
celebrating. So, the principles act as

m onum ents
of faith,
which establish growing
traditions, birth-purpose,
direction, and feelings of
identity.
“Seven is a holy digit
denoting truth, wisdom,
acceptance,
perfection
and understanding,” said
D orothy Winbush Riley,
author of The Complete
Kwanzaa
This sacred num ber
with its blazing truth
leads a person to the
expectancy and discovery
for prosperity, health and
success.
C hildren
are
the
h e a rt o f K w anzaa, so it involves seven
principles, observed with seven days, while
endorsing the seven symbols. So these truths
tie in to planting seeds into our children of
today so they are able to becom e the adults of
tomorrow.
On the first day of Kwanzaa, the celebrants
light the first of seven candles, while the seven
symbols counterpoint the seven principles. The
seven symbols of Kwanzaa are:
1.Mazoa
Fruits, nuts, vegetables
2. M keka
Place Mat
3. M uhindi Ears of corn
4. M ishumaa The seven candles
5. K inara
C andleholder
6. K ikom be Com munal cup of unity
cha umoja
7. Zaw adi
Gifts
M any holidays carry symbols and rituals
th a t accent the culture of th eir people.
K w anzaa’s intent is the same. The Kwanzaa
celebration stems from very close familial and
com m unal ties, so it should be observed with
another person. Thus, Kwanzaa emerges as a
spiritual celebration of unity, based on African
traditions.

B A C je ls

By Rcbecca Hopkins
For the A lestle
Once again it is that m erry time of year
when we’re all supposed to be happy, joyful
and full of love for our fellow humans. We are
bom barded with messages to buy and shop
and spend, spend, spend. In this season when
so many of us are struggling to keep our
heads above w ater just to survive, why do we
all try so hard to buy the perfect gift?
M any of us are facing this C hristm as
season with no m oney to buy gifts. It is
depressing, b u t all th e things th at are
im portant and dear to us are going to be here,
w hether we have money or not. The most

im portant gift we can give anyone is the gift
of time; it can’t be bought, packaged or taken
back in exchange for cash.
The gift of time can be given in many ways.
O ffer free babysitting services, cook a meal
for som eone, sit on the floor with a child and
color o r play a game, read o r visit with a
nursing hom e resident, offer to help wrap
packages, or just be there for a friend in need.
T here are so many ways we can help others
that really conveys the m eaning of Christmas
instead of handing over a package.
Giving your time is giving yourself, and
what b etter gift can there be? When you give
of yourself, you give love.

No warm seats on the bench

unique tradition

Men's basketball finding quality minutes from supporting cast

Baseball strikes

Besides the one-w eek peri­
od in the 1920's when the
Yankees, R ed Sox, and W hite
Sox quit th e A m erican
League, joined the National
League, and then went back
to the A m erican League, it
has been true ever since 1901:
A.L. is A.L. and N.L. is N.L.
and the two shall never meet.
Little by little, the custodi­
ans of baseball chip away at
the sports
tr a d itio n s ,
changing
the gam e
by bits and
pieces.
F irst
it was fake
grass m ak­
Todd Spann
ing stad i­
ums
into
m u lti- p u r ­
pose super fields.
Then came baseballs latest
"experim ent," the tem porary
d esignated h itte r, which is
now in its 24th season.
T he new "experim ent"
which is Interleague play, like
it or not will open up a p an ­
do ra's box of problems.
The baseball season has
always had equal co m p eti­
tion. The Cubs play the same
team s the M ets do, they play
them hom e and away. Every
year they beat the same team s
and lose to the same teams.
But when Interleague play is
implemented for the 1997 season,
lets say, the Cubs 15 interleague
games are against an A.L. central
division, like last years one great
team in the Indians and four
mediocre .500 teams. Then the
Mets 15 games are against A.L.
east teams like last years division
which had two playoffs teams in
the Orioles and Yankees Plus a
strong third team in Boston. In
short a stronger division.
Lets hypothesize even fur­
ther and say the Cubs and the
M ets are fighting for the wild
card. C ouldn't the wild card
be decided by the relative
strength of the divisions in the
o th er league
Baseball has been the only
sport th at b othered to m ain­
tain the integrity of separate
leagues. Two years ago, the
N F L offered San D iego
against San Francisco in the
Super Bowl. The team s had
played during th e regular sea­
son with the 49ers prevailing
by 23 points. It was no great
surprise then, th at they won
the Super Bowl by 23 points.
N or was th ere anything
real special when the Chicago
B ulls faced S eattle in the
NBA cham pionships because
they had played during the

Assistant Sports Editor
D epth is som ething the SIU E m en’s
basketball team didn’t have last season.
This year the team has a wealth of talent­
ed young players w ho have all con­
tributed to the C ougar’s 4-1 record.
H ead coach Jack M argenthaler is in
his fifth year at the helm of the Cougar
basketball program . H e will try to build
on the team ’s best start in seven years
with a well-rounded scoring attack.
The Cougars will look to senior guard
Jason Holm es from NeW Castle, Ind. to
contribute a fair share of the scoring. He
led the team in scoring his first three
years on the team and is currently aver­
aging 21.8 points per game.
“We know that Jason can score for us, but
he has shown improvement in his passing and
on defense,” Margenthaler said.
R onnie H enderson is a senior guard
from C airo who is currently second on
the team in scoring. A long with his 12.8
points per game, H enderson is the team
leader in rebounds.
“R onnie is the m ost athletic player on
the team . H e is extrem ely strong and
aggressive inside,” M argenthaler said.
New B aden’s Chris Brefeld is the only
o th er senior in the line-up. H e is coming
off knee reconstruction that kept him out
of action all last season. H e should be a
factor at the forw ard position once he is
physically 100 percent.
R usty Sarnes is a forw ard from

H avana who transferred to SIU E from
Lincoln College. H e is an accurate o u t­
side shooter who drained 5 three-point­
ers in a row on S aturday against
Lindenwood College.
N athan K reke is a ju n io r from
Effingham that will be a force on the

Head Coach Jack M argenthaler

offensive boards and should contribute
with his excellent perim eter shooting.
Junior M arlin Clark is a transfer stu­
d ent from S outheastern C om m unity
C ollege in B urlington, Iowa. This
D avenport, Iowa native is quick, an excel­
lent ball-handler and a talented outside
shooter who will quarterback the team
from his point guard position.
Travis Wallbaum is the only freshman
on the squad. The Ashland High School
graduate is 6-7 and will be called upon to
score inside and grab w hat rebounds he

can on b o th offense and defense.
W allbaum ’s strength and aggressiveness
are useful tools when he is used as a
screen to free up o th er shooters.
The title of quickest player on the
team goes to sophom ore Shaun Smoot.
This guard, from Natchez, Miss, is an
accurate passer who can also take the ball
to the hoop him self with his dribble
penetration
Mt. V ernon’s Tim Holloway is one of
the best defenders on the team. Holloway
is an accurate outside shooter who will be
a th reat behind the three-point arch.
Sophom ore Tim Thorsen is the tallest
p lay er on the team at 6-9. This
Schaum burg native will rebound and
score inside with regularity.
John P ru ett is a cen ter from
M etropolis who missed last season after
being the victim of a serious car accident.
“As a freshm an, John led the nation in
field goal p ercen tag e,” M argenthaler
said. “G etting him back is a big plus for
us. H e is still getting back into playing
shape, but h e’ll be a factor when we start
our conference schedule.”
Chad Moss is a junior guard from
Highland, 111. who will be an outside
shooting threat and a key m em ber of the
C ougar defense.
M argenthaler has started a different
line-up in each of S IU E ’s first five games.
“We are blessed with a lot of players
that can play,” M argenthaler said. “O ur

D itk a to S h an ah an : G o all o u t
(A P ) — M ike D itka, the last NFL coach to
be in M ike Shanahan’s position, has some
perspective on how the D enver Broncos
should play their three m eaningless regularseason games: G o all out.
"I think the worst thing you can do is rest
people,"’ said D itka, whose 1985 Chicago
Bears clinched hom e-field advantage in the
playoffs with three games left, just as the
Broncos did last Sunday.
The Bears, who finished 15-1 and went on
to beat New England 46-10 in the Super
Bowl, were the only other team in the Super
Bowl era to clinch the best conference
record this early.
Chicago w ent on to win its final three
games after the clinching game, which ironi­
cally came the week of its only loss _ a 38-24
defeat in Miami. The D olphins w ere m otivat­
ed by the prospect of keeping the 1972
Miami team the only one to go through a
season unbeaten.
Still, the Bears used all their important players
down the stretch. Walter Payton carried 26 times in
a 17-10 win over Indianapolis He ran 28 times in a
19-6 victory over the New York Jets and a mere 17
in a 37-17 win over Detroit in the season finale.
Ditka isn’t exactly telling Shanahan how to
coach. But he suggests the Denver coach leave it
up to John Elway, who has a sore hamstring,
whether to start at quarterback against Green Bay
on Sunday and in the final two games against
Oakland and San Diego.
"You don’t play people who are injured,"
he said. "'We had no choice but to rest Jim
M cM ahon. But I believe in playing all out.
Buffalo is the worst example. They’ve rested
their best guys after they’ve clinched and

they’ve lost four Super Bowls.”
N ot that the Bears didn’t relax a bit.
O n the Friday after they clinched hom e
field in 1985, they taped the "Super Bowl
Shuffle," the rap video impossible to avoid
during their run to victory.
"I rem em ber the day before the game that
they were playing it in the locker room , the
audio, not the video, which we did n ’t have
yet," said Bryan H arlan, the team ’s public
relations director.
"Some of the guys, like D an H am pton,
hated it, but most of them were having a
great time."
Said Ditka: "Did they do that? They must
have had earphones on. I was a loose coach,
but not that loose."
Actually the Bears didn’t play particular­
ly well that week, beating an Indianapolis
team that finished 5-11 that year by just
seven points after being tied 3-3 at halftime.
B ut Payton gained 111 yards and one of the
best defenses in N FL history did the rest.
The Bears played m ore efficiently in their
last two regular-season games and it carried
over into the playoffs. They didn’t allow a
point in their two N FC playoff games, shut­
ting out the G iants 21-0 and the Ram s 24-0 at
Soldier Field.
Then they went on to trounce the Patriots in
New Orleans, site of this season’s Super Bowl.
"This is a little different because they’re
playing team s that have som ething at stake _
G reen Bay wants hom e field in the NFC,”
D itka said. "B u t we didn’t call the dogs off
and I don’t think Mike Shanahan will do that
either. I hope he gets th e sam e
result we had.”
