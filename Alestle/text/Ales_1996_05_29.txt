SIUE makes busing deal
MCT to take over bus routes
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor

Changes in store for new busing system

B eginning July 1, M adison
County Transit (M CT) will start
implementing busing for Tower
Lake residents.
According to Kenneth Neher,
vice
chancellor
for
adm inistration, an agreem ent was
reached between the university
and M CT a week ago.
"We (the university) decided to
go with MCT. We will phase in
services starting the first of July.
The buses should be up and
running in the fall. The yellow
buses will go away the end of
June,” N eher said.
N eher believes the new busing
system is a great deal for SIU E
students.
'‘W e're p retty excited about
this. The
buses
are
fully
handicapped accessible. And the
off-cam pus busing will allow
stu dents to go up and down
(R oute) 159 where all the stores
are
and
surrounding
communities," N eher said.
O ther services that are being
provided
by
M CT include
w eekend services from the
cam pus to the East St. Louis
M etro Link station. N eher said
this allows students to have more
access to the entire m etropolitan
St. Louis area.
The new deal has not come
without its share of controversy.
As a result with the new
agreem ent, jobs for the bus drivers
were questioned by both students

Second employee death in two weeks hits university

Richard N yerges

By Ty Norris
News Reporter

O n the evening of May 20,
Dr. Richard T. Nyerges, 53,
professor in the Southern
Illinois
U niversity
at
Edw ardsville
School
of
Business, d ep a rtm en t of
finance, died of lung cancer at
his home. This was the third
em ployee
to die since
January of this year and the
second in two weeks.
N yerges had been a
m em ber of the faculty since
1980. His death only added
to the discom fort already felt
am ong
the
university
community.

“ I’ve known him for 14
years, and we were really
close," Jacky So, professor
and chairm an of finance
departm ent, said. “We were
the best of colleagues and the
best of friends. He was like a
big brother to me.”
The lung cancer was
detected after Nyerges had
broke a shoulder playing
racquetball. During a routine
x-ray, doctors detected some
abnorm alities around the
please see NYERGES, page 2

Last Friday, the newly-elected student senate
held their first m eeting with a debate on the
university's contract with M adison C ounty
Transit.
Student Body President C hristopher Nance
gave his thoughts on the contract.
“ In my opinion, I am in agreem ent of the
M CT contract. However, I do hold reservations
about the ethical concepts in which the
university negotiated w ithout input from
students,” Nance said.
Nance was also concerned with how the labor
union for the bus drivers brought the issue of
busing to the attention of the students and not
the university. O ther student senators also had
reservations about the contract.
“ I d on’t approve of how the university went
over students and student governm ent's heads to
get this deal done," Student Senator D em etre
Pegues said.
“I feel th at the university doesn't care what
we say. The university should take our opinion
and if not, then we should not be here," Student
S enator R obert M um phard said.
Student Body Vice President Jam es Little said
that student governm ent will ask the university
about the MCT deal.
“Student governm ent will m eet with the
university to bring different questions th at the
students on campus have about Tower Lake
busing,"Little said. “We also will discuss the
m atter of the students being left in darkness
about the negotiations.”
Meetings between student governm ent and
the university will likely occur during the week.

Indianapolis 500— someday it will be “ ladies and gentleman, start your engines
“Lady and gentlem an ,start your engines!”
Those famous words uttered by Chairm an of the
Board Em eritus IMS, % year-old M ary Fendrich
Hulman, were the signal of the start of one of
the greatest spectacles in racing —the
Indianapolis 500.
For me, the words were exciting and new. This
was the first year I have ever attended the 500
and when my loving fiance' and his family asked
me to go with them earlier this year, all I could
say was, “I have to sleep on the ground and I
can’t shower all w eekend?”
"Big Ron.” my fiance’s father tried to prepare
me for the event, taping other races and showing
me some of the past hom e videos.
However, nothing could have prepared me for
what I experienced when I was actually there.
The crazy weather. The men yelling at women
to bear their sex organs. Police officers yelling at
people and arresting them for jay-walking. A nd
of course, the race.
The race was an experience in itself. All of the
people, the noise and the excitem ent of watching
the person you are cheering for lap the car in front of them.
Being the kind of person that I am, I researched the driver that I was
rooting for, the “lady” in “Lady and G entlem en." A nd through research it
seems that Lyn St. Jam es has put up with a lot of slack in her five year Indy
career.
Lyn is the second female to race in the Indy 500, the first being Janet Guthrie,
who raced for only three years.
Lyn was a test-driver for Ford for fifteen years, and has set records for

women in racing. She is the form er
president of the W om en’s Sports
Foundation, a co lu m n ist, a spokesperson
and has just recently flown with the
Thunderbirds. She has a wall full of awards
and has visited the W hite House three times
during the Reagan adm inistration.
With all of her accomplishments,
one might think that the sponsors would be
lining up to turn her head. But they are not.
In fact, Lyn is the only driver that
m ust solicit sponsors for herself or put up
her own money to drive in the race. This
year, if it had n ’t been for the television
network. Lifetime for Women, a h e w ouldn’t
even have been able to race. Fair? No. The
reason?
Well, some spectators say, fear.
O thers say simply that racing is a m an’s
sport and should rem ain as such.
I w hole-heartedly disagree with
both answers, but they are honest and
realistic. Until people become m ore openm inded and gender equal, drivers like Lyn will face these obstacles.
Even though Lyn was unable to finish the race due to a tangle with Scott
H errington’s car in Turn 1, she had a lot of support from other women behind
her and proved that she was just as tough as the men, which is a good start.
With even m ore support and a few m ore courageous women stepping out to
take the challenge and face the odds, when Hulm an stands up to utter those
famous six words, someday she can say, “Ladies and gentlem an, start your
engines.”

letter to the editor.

Attacking President Clinton: A waste of taxpayer’s money
I call to your attention and to your readers’
atten tio n a very unfair situation th at is
unfolding in our great nation.
A brutal political attack on our President,
Bill Clinton, is being waged by a num ber of
people including S enator D 'A m a to and a
totally partisan Republican attorney, Kenneth
Starr.
D ’A m ato ’s innuendo laden attack is being
financed with out tax dollars. H e is the senator
who was reprim anded by the Senate Ethics
Com mittee and refuses to m ake public the
tran scrip t of his own E thics C om m ittee
investigation. He is also Bob D ole’s Steering
Com m ittee Chairm an.
Special prosecutor K enneth S tarr’s fishing
expedition and desperate attem pt to malign
the president is also being financed with our
tax dollars. To date, W hitew ater has cost the
American taxpayers over $30 million dollars.
Starr is spending our tax m oney at the rate of
one million dollars each m onth. Mind boggling
isn’t it, considering that after spending all of
this money there is no proof of wrongdoing by
the president. It should be noted this is a parttime job for Mr. Starr. H e is also em ployed by
a num ber of clients who are natural enem ies of
President Clinton. They include a tobacco
com pany a,:d the conservative B radley
Foundation. Mr Starr draws about one million

dollars a year from his law firm plus thousands
from the government for the Whitewater
hearings.
Now, on the other side of the coin is
President Clinton who must pay all of his own
legal bills to defend himself against this
unabashed political attack. The president has a
defense fund but by law cannot solicit money.

C ontributors can give money up to $1,000 per
person. No one else can spend m oney to
advertise and solicit money because of the
$1, 000 limit. Needless to say, the money on a
voluntary basis is coming in very slowly. The
president has legal bills owed of over $3
million dollars.
This is a national disgrace. I urge all of you,
Democrats, Republicans and Independents to
help the president. Send in one dollar, five
dollars, 25 dollars or 100 dollars or m ore to
help our leader. He is not a wealthy person, so
he has no other m eans to pay these bills.
However, he must defend himself against these
attacks. You can contribute by sending your
contributions to: Presidential Legal Expense
Trust, Dept. 70, Washington, D.C. 20055-0070.
I am using this m eans to com m unicate
because no one can buy ads to ask for help. I
hope this new spaper will u nderstand the
unfairness of this situation and allow this letter
to be printed. They could invite opposing
views, that is fine, as long as we get the message
out.
We elected Bill Clinton as our president and
we should help him defend himself against
unfair attacks on a very unlevel playing field.
If you want to know the true facts about
W hitewater, write me with your nam e and
address and I will send you a fact sheet
detailing the whole true story.

Sincerely,
Jerry Sinclair
Concerned Citizen

You might spy hard, but you might not laugh too hard at this
spy flick. Although "Spy Hard" does have some funny scenes,
there are only a few that can cause some really hard laughs.
Co-produced by Leslie Nielsen and directed by Rick
Friedberg/'Spy Hard"features a bad guy, General Rancor
(Andy Griffith), as a guy with no arms. And, Dick Steele (Leslie
Nielsen), as a good guy with no brains. The plot? The armless
guy and the brainless guy match wits.
Steele, a.k.a. Agent WD-40, was The Agency's top spy way
back when. But during a confrontation with the evil General
Rancor, Steele's fellow agent and true love Victoria Dahl
(Stephanie Romanov) literally slips through his fingers and
plunges to her death. Steele leaves The Agency. Rancor is
believed to be dead. But he doesn't die; he just loses his arms.
Fifteen years later, Rancor turns up again as evil as ever. He
takes Victoria's daughter Barbara Dahl (Stephanie Romanov)
hostage and will only release her if he is given a microchip that
will allow him to control the world. And that means only one
thing. Steele is the only one Who can save the vorld and rescue
the younger Dahl in doing so.
The time starts ticking. Steele meets up with Agent 3.14
(Nicollette Sheridan) and together they battle the bad guys.
The two agents even meet up with other celebrities such as
Robert Guillaume, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Ray Charles, Fabio and
Mr.T.
Among the spoofs of other movies (such as "Sister Act,"
"Speed,""True Lies" and "Home Alone"), Sheridan and Nielsen
are somewhat funny in this slapstick comedy. Yet the humor
isn't anything new. It seem s to be almost a rehash of "Airplane"
and the "Naked Gun" series. But Griffith does play a believable
bad guy. Steele's sidekick Kabul (John Ales) and The Director
(Charles Duming) of The Agency are also pretty silly, too.
But perhaps the funniest part of the entire movie is the
theme song by "Weird Al"Yankovic and the opening animation.
Overall,"Spy Hard" is a spy flick for the not-so-serious
moviegoer. But serious or not-so-serious, you might be better
off just waiting for the video.

Ironic, don’t
you think

A l e s t l e

Wednesday, May

29, 1996

Dueling day for the 500s
BROOKLYN, Mich. (A P)

How much sweeter could
it get than Michael Jordan
coming back to the Orena in
Orlando

and score
45 points.
Here
is
where the
i r o n y

comes in. A
year ago in
the same
building

Jordan stumbled to an errorfilled loss in Game 1 of an
eventual six-game playoff
elimination wearing jersey
No. 45, the number he chose
when he returned from an 18
month sabbatical.
On
Monday, Jordan
completed the Chicago Bulls
four-game sweep of the
Orlando Magic and after a
long road back to the
pinnacle of the Eastern
Conference, Jordan scored
45 points to close the deal on
Orlando.
Jordan said it was all just a
big coincidence but when he
missed those two free throws
at the end of the game .it
makes a person wonder
what he was up too.
Lets face it, Jordan
doesn’t miss free throws at
the end of a game. He might
miss one on accident but not
two.
Whether
it
was
coincidence or not, it was still
a very sweet victory in
Orlando for the Bulls and
Jordan.
Now that “tomorrow’s
team” is taken care of, let’s
look ahead a bit to the
almost
certain
series
between
the
Seattle
Supersonics and the Chicago
Bulls.
Seattle, who is up 3-1 in
their series with Utah, will
bring
in
what
some
basketball analysts call the
only defense that can stop
the Bulls.
But we all saw during the
New York Knicks series that
the Bulls can survive without
the offensive punch of their
normal performance.
The Bulls won that series
through their defense even
when the Knicks held the
Bulls to around 90 points.
The fact is, they know how
to win and they are not
rookies in these situations.
Maturity, experience and
talent will take you a long
way. And the Bulls will take
their play to another level
whenever they have too.

Two races in two places. Each 500
miles long. One with 80 years of
tradition. The other with none at all.
One race with mostly no-names, the
other with the best drivers in the
sport.
“For me it doesn’t matter,” said
Roberto Moreno, who finished third
in Sunday’s inaugural U.S. 500. “I
don’t get involved in the politics. It’s
unfortunate we don’t have the
glamour of Indy but we put up a good
show.”
Bobby Rahal, knocked out of the
U.S. 500 after hitting the wall on the
130th lap, had no time to worry about
Indianapolis.
Amy O'Conner/ for the Alestie
”1 was here to win,” he said. “What

guess Buddy Lazier won. It’s good t"e msi° e track arouncl the "1irc>turn at the Indianapolis 500 Sunday afternoon.
for him.”
Jimmy Vasser, the winner at Michigan International Speedway, took solace in knowing he beat the finest talent.
“I haven’t had time to reflect,” he said. “It’s been an issue for a long time, the Indy-U.S. 500. And we’ve dealt with it. The best
of the business were here and we beat them. We won a lot of money and we made history today.”
The rift developed after the Indy Racing League President Tony George decreed that 25 of the 33 starting spots at the Indy
500 would go to members of his league.
CART officials said no thanks and no way.
And so the U.S. 500 was born, a rebel race run on the same day as one of American’s most storied sporting events.
“There were an awful lot of fans that came to support our cause,” Vasser said. “It was free and open competition and I’ve said
it every time — it’s absolutely ridiculous for somebody to reserve 25 spots, regardless of speeds. It doesn’t happen in any other
sport.
“We were forced to have this race. It was a huge success and I’m sure it will be in the future, as well.”
IndyCar President Andrew Craig, fortified by Sunday’s attendance of 110,879, said a site has not been determined for next
year’s U.S. 500 but he expects there to be one.
“We are certainly committed to running the U.S. 500 in the future,” he said. “We are not averse to a resolution with the
Indianapolis 500 but we are committed to this race next year, the year after that, the year 2,000.”
George characterized a crash on the final pace lap that involved 12 cars as more disappointing than embarrassing for a race
that had billed itself as “The real cars, the real stars ...The Real 500.”
