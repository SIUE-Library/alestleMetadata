1 dies, 2 injured in restaurant shooting in Chicago
is soaring again, 13 years after
losing one wing to a hunter’s bullet, thanks to a hang glider. “I think he
likes the wind in his face,” the bird’s caretaker and flying companion
said.
John Stokes is a rehabilitator and educator with the National
Foundation to Protect America’s Eagles, based in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.
His hobby is hang gliding, and he decided last year to develop a special
harness so Osceola could accompany him. Stokes said he’s noticed
something different about the bird recently. “I don’t know how to
describe it. He looked more confident. There was a fire in his eye,
something was back,” he said.

Watercolor believed to be painted by Hitler
REU TERS—A watercolor believed to have been painted by Adolf
Hitler was sold in London Wednesday for $3,750. The picture, described
by one expert as “a bit of a slapdash daub,” had been found by a soldier
in a bomb-damaged Hamburg apartment in 1945. It recently resurfaced
along with other Nazi memorabilia in Lincolnshire. The painting, which
depicts a Vienna street scene, is dated 1911 and signed “A. H itler”. It
coincides with a period when Hitler was trying to make a living as an
artist in his native Austria.

BELLEV ILLE NEWS DEM O CR A T—A
restaurant
manager died and two men were injured in a shooting early
Sunday at a restaurant on the northwest side of Chicago.
A man walked into a restaurant, fired shots and fled, Sgt.
Francis Lee said. He said police do not have a motive, but do
not think the man was trying to rob the restaurant.
The dead woman was identified as Maria Rodriguez, 48.
One of the men with her was in serious condition Sunday
afternoon with a wound to the back. The other man was in
good condition with a wound to the hand. Police did not
identify them.
Police said the three were the only people in the restaurant.
Deformed frog found in Missouri
AP—Biologists are getting jumpy over the discovery of a
five-legged frog in eastern Missouri. They say it could mean
the state has joined a disturbing environmental trend.
The frog was found by a seventh-grader last week at a pond
near his school. This is the first deformed frog found in
Missouri, 10 other states have reported sightings of deformed
frogs in the past year as well.
Although they haven’t determined what is causing the
deformities, researchers have great concern.

Transportation. We all use it to somehow
get from one place to another and there are
many types of transportation. Bus. Bike. Walk.
With so many ways to get around, my question
is, why, if you live at Tower Lake do you drive
to school every morning? D o n ’t you know that
there is a bike path from your front door
straight to your class?
Did you know that you can get to class
faster on a bike than you can in a car?
D o you know that short trips and cold starts
are damaging to your car, cost money and are
the cause of much of the pollution of the
environm ent?
Did you know that the new bus service runs
every six m inutes during most class hours?
There is simply no excuse for driving your
car to class unless you are handicapped. If you
don’t believe me about the pollutants em itted
from your car, try starting it one m orning and
then going around back and putting your lips
around the tail pipe and taking a deep breath.
T hat is what you are doing to my air,
everyone’s air when you drive to class.
If that doesn’t convince you, and it probably
won’t, let me appeal to economics, time and

A l e s t l e

convenience. It costs money to
drive back and forth, not only
in terms of gas but in damaging
miles (repair bills), as your cold
car drives the three-quarters of
a mile to school.
Everyday I see you leaving the
Tower Lake parking lot as I do
on my bike, and I see you come
into class late as hell. It is much
quicker to ride a bike. Not to

that SIU E will be getting public bikes. But the
m oney you would save by not driving would
quickly pay for a good bike.
I would like to thank all those brave and
daring folks who walk, bike or ride the bus
every day. But I do have one criticism of some
who ride bikes, and I may be guilty at times of
this, too. W hen you come up behind some
unsuspecting pedestrian, d on’t assume they
have eyes in the back of their heads, simply say,
“on your left,” or “on your right,” “watch out”
or even a rude exclamation like, “get the f**ck
out of the way!”. A n incident I saw the other
day involved a guy on his $5000 spotless,
barely-ridden m ountain bike who almost ran
over an entire crowd where the bike trail splits
up to Building III. He could have avoided the
whole incident had he alerted the pedestrians
as he was approaching. This type of incident
happens too often, and could be avoided.
Walk, bike (safely) or take the bus. Save
yourself som e tim e and m oney and stop
polluting our air. Walking and biking are both
good exercise and might save you from having
to spend all your money on Weight Watchers
and Richard Simmons.

A pathy Sucks: get involved in on campus
“A pathy Sucks” is a commonly used term on this campus. However, all to often it is coming
from students that do not know the meaning of the phrase.
The definition of apathy is lack of feeling or lack of involvement. In order for a person to
use this term and not be labeled a hypocrite, the student should fulfill the definition and get
involved.
One organization that anyone can join is the University C enter Board (U.C.B.). This is a
voluntary organization on campus that plans activities for the student body. The U.C.B. is
comprised of many different com m ittees that sponsor a variety of events., so your interest will
probably be covered. All events sponsored by the U.C.B. are planned by students. Many of
these events which range from concerts to movies have free admittance.
You may be wondering where the board gets its money to sponsor these events. Well, in
essence you, the student, are paying for the event. Each time that you pay tuition, a certain
am ount is given to voice your opinions and ideas. A fter all, why should you pay for something
that you are not going to use.
T here are so many volunteer organizations on campus that I just do not have the room to
m ention them. These organizations are constantly looking for volunteers and suggestions so
why not give them some. Just hop on over to the University C enter and wander around until
you find the Kimmel Leadership C enter on the main floor. You can talk to the students in the
office about which organization would be right for you. D o not be one of those people that
complain about everything, do som ething about it.

letter to the editor

Reader’s response
appreciated by columnist
This letter is in regards to the response w ritten by Mr.
Smith, in last Thursday’s issue of the Alestle, regarding my
column on “Star W ars”.
Mr. Smith, thanks for your well thought out reply to my
column on “Star W ars”. I stand corrected, there was a kiss
between the siblings in “E m pire”. I must have been referring
to the kiss from “Star W ars”, which appears on my exclusive
“D irector’s C ut” edition. My apologies. I ’m glad you realized
this was a light-hearted attem p t at pointing ou t the
peculiarities in the trilogy. Obviously, I’m not the only one
who reads too closely into things. I’m just glad I didn ’t write
a column on “Star Trek”, because I probably would have
woke up with some Tribbles in my bed. Thanks for reading!

Alpha Sigma Tau
applauded for their support
On Friday, Oct. 18, the ladies of A lpha Kappa Alpha
Sorority Inc. had their neophyte presentation to recognize the
newest m em bers that had crossed over into greekdom. A fter
the presentation, the other greek organizations in the National
Pan-Hellenic Council (historically, black organizations) began
the presentation of gifts. Also m aking an appearance were the
members of A lpha Sigma Tau Sorority Inc. The m em bers of
A lpha Sigma Tau expressed their gratitude for being invited to
the cerem ony and offered a sincere welcome to the new
m em bers of A lpha K appa A lpha. T hey received a well
deserved ovation.
I was pleased by this show of support. O n a campus as
diverse as this one, I feel that all greeks no m atter what council,
C ollegiate Panhellenic, In terfraternity , o r N ational PanHellenic, should support each other. I myself am not greek, but
I do live with a m em ber of a greek organization and I do attend
greek events with her. While attending these events, I have
noticed the seldom attendance of m em bers from the Collegiate
Panhellenic and Interfraternity Councils. W hat took place last
Friday evening is what greek life should be about...supporting
each other. The event m ade greek life even m ore appealing to
me.
Once again, I applaud the m em bers of A lpha Sigma Tau. I
view their actions as a positive step forward. I hope the show of
support continues from Collegiate Panhellenic Council and
Interfraternity Council to the National Pan-Hellenic Council
and vice versa.

Stress of college life can take its toll if
students don't take care of themselves
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
B reathe in. B reath out. B reathe in. B reathe
out. B reathe in.
Stress is surrounding people on a daily
basis. They can welcome it as a friend or run
from it as an enemy, but it will be there.
Today’s hectic lifestyles are contributing to
the am ount of stress on individual faces.
Finding time for work, classes, family life and
hom ework can m ake people feel like they’re
jugglers in a three-ring circus.
M anaging that time helps m ake time, Sarah
B radbury said. B radbury is a counselor at
S IU E ’s Counseling Service.
“We need a balance; academ ic, social,
spiritual and physical,” she said. She added
that students tend to focus on the m ental area
while in college, neglecting others aspects of
their lives, which can throw them off balance.
While m idterm s may cause some students
to hyperventilate, others rem ain calm. This,
said B radbury, is because stress is very
individual. “But we all need some stress in our
lives,” she said. “If you had no stress in your
lives, you would probably be asleep.”
A ccording to Bradbury, an optim um level
of stress gives us energy, m otivates us and
sharpens o u r perception. In fact, the
symptoms of too little stress and too much
stress are strikingly sim ilar; deactivated
m otivation, boredom , increased use of drugs
and alcohol and som etim es absenteeism .
B radbury said historically stress came from
physical attacks on our well-being, the “fight
or flight” theory of behavior. She said we still
react in the same way, although the “attacks”
today usually a re n ’t physical so m uch as
they are m ental.
“R eacting physically works against people
nowadays,” she said. A nd typical responses
such as shopping, sleeping, using drugs,
avoiding a situation or doing nothing are all
negative ways of coping.
“In the long run, these behaviors cause
m ore stress. T here are m ore positive coping
m ethods, like exercise, m editation, deep
breathing, stretching and laughing,” she said.
How does a certified counselor deal with
the stress of other people’s problem s?
“W hat works best for me is exercise. It is a
way of relieving tension that is built up. It
helps you feel better or feel as if you can deal
with things better. It m akes you stronger both
mentally and physically,” she said.
Relaxation is slowing down and clearing
your head for a while. It’s what B radbury

com pares to a “m ini-vacation”. A nd a free one
at that. “It’s a way of getting away, so when
you go back it doesn’t seem so bad.”
Students can lounge in a quiet spot, close
their eyes and focus on a peaceful place for
ten m inutes to feel refreshed. Also, they can
repeat one word over and over again in their
mind for relaxation purposes.
H ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
“Laughing is a good way to deal with stress.
I t’s also a good form of aerobic exercise,”
B radbury said. Students should keep a reserve
of funny movies, games or books on hand. O r
they can call their funny friends or go to a
com edy club for a few good laughs.
If stress is not dealt with properly, it can
lead to health problems. Physiologically, stress
causes sweating, increased heart ra te and
blood pressure, dilated pupils and shallow
breathing. Prolonged stress can lead to a
decrease in the im m une system, high blood
p ressure, h ea rt attacks, strokes, ulcers or
gastrointestinal problems.
W hen do you know you need help?
“Basically, if you feel like things aren’t
getting any better, you are losing your ability
to co n c en trate o r think clearly, o r your
relationships are suffering,” B radbury said,
“then it’s time to come and see us.”
O ne of the top reasons students go to the
C ounseling Service is their relationships, she
said. “ Relationships cause a lot of stress. We
have to deal with people every day of our lives
and some of them are very im portant to us.”
The C ounseling C en ter is in the brick
building at the four way stop near Tower Lake.
T here are three counselors willing to help
students through difficult times. Best of all, the
counseling is free.
B radbury encourages students to come in
and talk things over with someone, and said,
“ It doesn’t have to be some m ajor catastrophe
for students to come in”.
The Office o f C ontinuing E ducation is
offering a “M anaging Stress and B urnout”
sem inar Oct 21 and Oct. 28 from 6:30 to 8:30
p.m. in the Peck Building, R oom 2415. There is
a $24 fee.
If you would like to practice exercises that
will evoke relax atio n , peacefulness and
serenity, you can call (618) 692-3210 to register
for this seminar. Stress m anagem ent, coping
skills, self-care skills and auto hypnosis will be
discussed.
Have you had your break today? D o n ’t
forget to breathe.

Ups for dealing with stress:
• Try deep breathing. Inhale slowly through your nose, exhale slowly through
your mouth. Repeat 3-4 times.
• Stretch. While sitting in a chair, lean over, resting your body on your lap; let
your head drop forward. Relax for 1-2 minutes, then slowly sit up.
• Close your eyes and visualize a peaceful scene for 5-10 minutes.

from Landm ark Realty, was the mother-inlaw of the original sellers.
Landm ark agent R uth Jones was out of
town and could not be reached for com m ent.
A ccording to the Schneiders, the
residents of the A lpha Phi house began
receiving threats of eviction in O ctober of
last year.
H e also said A lpha Phi m em ber and
P anhellenic C ouncil p resid en t C hrissy
Smiddy served Christie Schneider and other
residents fake eviction notices. H e also
alleges that they received threats of bodily
harm if they did not move out.
“We first received threats to move, from
R uth Jones, over the telephone. Then one
day Jones comes out to the house with the
owner of the house and another guy. There
was this great big guy. H e had to be about
6’4, a white guy. He said he was going to kill
us,” Paul Schneider said.
Paul Schneider also said that they called
police but they (the police) “turned a blind
eye”.
H e said the other girls, intim idated by the
threats, moved out. With Christie Schneider
the only person living there, he said, a rum or
spread throughout campus about a “trash
the A lpha P hi’s H ouse night”.
“Christie found out from a Sigma Pi; she
then let m e know, and Jason (Butkovitch)
and another guy from work went over there.
Some things in the house had already been
broken,” Paul Schneider said.
H e alleges th at A lpha Phi m em ber,
A m anda W estergom, broke som e doors and
door locks.
“The young people over there were going
to wait m e out. They knew I was not going to
allow them to trash the house,” Paul
Schneider said.
H e also said th at the people in the

house—som e being A lpha Phi m em bers—
poured liquids and trash all over the carpet
in the basem ent, ruining the carpet.
Paul Schneider said that as recently as
F riday he was co n tacted by A lpha Phi
International out of Chicago, concerning the
case.
“Julie Sears (of A lpha Phi) apologized.
She said the girls who filed these charges
erred by not getting perm ission from
International,” Paul Schneider said.
Christie Schneider still believes in A lpha
Phi and the m eaning of sisterhood.
“ I jo in ed (A lp h a Phi) because of
sisterhood. I still believe in the sorority,”
Christie Schneider said. “Just because a few
people ...”
“ ... w eren’t sisters to her,” Paul Schneider
interrupted.
“These few have caused me to have to go
to em otional counseling ... all I did was my
best,” Christie Schneider said.
Prelim inary hearings involving the
Schneiders, B utkovitch and A lpha Phi
Sorority will take place Oct. 25 at 9 a.m. at
th e M adison C ounty C ourthouse. The
Schneiders are m aking a m otion to have the
charges against them dropped.
“We will get presented with w hat’s called
a bill of particulars. We will know exactly
w hat we did that m ade o u r actions criminal,”
Paul Schneider said.
Paul Schneider said that he, along with
C hristie S ch n eid er and D ennis (Jason)
Butkovitch, have filed a counter suit against
L andm ark R ealty Inc., and R uth Jones.
(E ditor’s Note: In a letter to the editor last

Committment to better health: controlling your blood sugar
By Ty Norris
Lifestyle Editor
Stress, fear, worry and too
little sleep are problem s
which m ay effect students
w ith heavy schedules.D id
you know that your blood
sugar can go up from stress,
illness and a drastic change in
your diet?
To all students who are
diabetic, or who have a friend
w ith diabetes, your high
blood sugar may tend to give
you a co n stan t feeling of
thirst and hunger. You may
also suffer from sym ptoms
such as excessive tiredness,
blurred vision and a drastic weight gain, o r loss.
It is sad to say, but some young patients may
feel they’re in control of their illness, resulting in
im proper health care.
T here was an incident involving a young
black male, who we will call “John”. John had
his d iab etes u n d e r excellent control while
slaying at home. Though, while at school, John
becam e ill with a cough and a fever.
H e ignored the signs of his sugar level being
high for several weeks. H e was experiencing
constant thirst and hunger, and his weight was
already over the norm al weight for a m an his
age by som e 18 pounds. H e was also tired most
of the time.
John was a pre-m ed m ajor, had just taken his
first exams, and received a failing grade. H e
becam e angry w ith him self and began
overeating foods he was not supposed to have.
L ater in the day of the exam, John experienced

a fever of 102 degrees and had
contracted a virus; he had to be
rushed to the hospital.
The doctors used a glucom eter
(an instrum ent used to m easure
blood sugar) which recorded his
sugar at 1800 (norm al range 110250). H e was diagnosed as
sem icom atose and was breathing
heavily.
The doctors attem p ted to
rehydrate him, increase his urine
output and lower his blood sugar.
A fter the ordeal was over, John
was just glad to be alive.
Though these events are based
on a true story, the real patient
tragically died.
Som eone very close to me is diabetic. I may
not be diabetic, bu t I can help him by
encouraging him to take care of himself. My
friend was diagnosed with diabetes six years ago.
H e now takes insulin shots, and when he doesn’t
stay on it, he suffers for it. H e also said that he is
trying to eat right. If you know som eone who is
diabetic, you can help them by m aking sure they
take care of their health.
It takes com m itm ent to take your insulin as
scheduled. The end result is that you will feel
b etter and keep your body healthy. If you have a
friend or family m em ber who is diabetic, take
the time to learn to help them control their
glucose level.
For m ore inf- u- ‘ion on diabetes call SIU E

Dr. Lee Johnson M.D.

sugar
By Ty Norris
Lifestyle Editor
Testing your blood sugar takes commitment. Here are
some steps to using a glucometer to check your blood
glucose level.
— ——
Step 1: Draw a Drop of Blood
T jjrf
Wash your hands with soap
and warm water Dry them thoroughly.
MI
Don't use alcohol, since it can change
i Prick the side of your finger with
the lancet. Squeeze gently until you get a
------— ----------- large drop of blood..
Step 2: Place the Drop on a Test Strip
Cover the entire pad with blood. For
some meters, you may have to wipe the
strip after a short period of time.
Step 3: Read the Test Strip
Insert the test strip in the meter. The
number that lights up is your blood
glucose level.

Step 4: Record Your Results
Write your blood glucose level in a
record book every time you test your
blood. Also, take your record book
with you when visiting your doctor.

TOOL will heat up the stereo with new CD release, A E N IM A
By Melanie Adams
Editor in Chicr
It has b een a long time since
fans o f altern ativ e music have
seen a new album by the band
TOOL which began in 1991. But
after three long years, their wait is
finally over. TOOL’S newest, and
best CD thus far, AENIMA hit

The band, which began its U.S.
lour O ct.i6, will be com ing to the
St. Louis A m erican T h eatre
Nov. 12.
A E N IM A rocks with a variety
of songs that are classic TOOL.
W ith their prim eval beat and their
screech of original guitar lines,
TOOL leads us through the first
track entitled, “Stinkfist:”.
The lyrics, w ritten and sung by
M aynard Jam es K eenan, w ere as

the - vocals were m ore than just (Guitar) of the band TOOL. The group .s set to come to St. Louis as part of their U.S. Tour
another instrum ent in the jum bled ^ ov- ^ ^
m adness of their music that creates
th e distinct sound th at js only
TOOL.
Even though the lyrics of the songs w ere unclear at times, the music itself
sends listeners on a pathw ay o f em otion. From the m om ent the CD begins to
play, each song takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of feelings of rage, fear
and even light-heartedness.

O ne m om ent a song is full of
venom , spitting and raging
and in the next m om ent, it
shifts its m ood like a tornado
shifts it trek and becom es
alm ost lig h t-h earted
and
ten d er, leaving th e listener
feeling a jum ble of emotion.
Som e
of
th e
m ore
m em orable songs on the CD
are the tunes; “H ooker with a
Penis,” a song ab o u t a
p erfo rm er
who
has
symbolically sold his soul to
m ake a record and confronts a
fan who tells him off about
selling out. “Eulogy”, a song
full of rage about a friend who
has died and “D ie E ier von
S atan”, roughly translated in
English, “The Eggs of S atan”.
The last track of the CD,
“Third E ye”, was the longest
of the songs and is equivalent
in length to Iron Butterfly’s
“In-a-G adda-D a-V ida” which
runs f° r over 17 minutes. The
CD case is en tertain in g as
well, with its action pictures
that come out to grab you and
the m ap of C alifornia inside that falls off the world.
A E N IM A is all around the best new CD release on the m arket today. With
A E N IM A , TOOL shows what they can really do and it is one CD that TOOL
lovers shouldn’t
pass up.

Davis and Jackson will blow you away in 'Long Kiss Goodnight'
Action thriller revives Geena Davis' career after Cutthroat Island sinks ship at box office
By Corey Stulcc
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
If there ever was a career killer,
“C utthroat Island” was it. By some
miracle, director R enny H arlin and
actress G eena Davis are back with a
new action-adventure. The good news
is, it doesn’t stink!
“The L ong Kiss G o o d n ig h t” is
an o th er in the long line of big
explosion, heavy violence, w ise­
crackin’, bang-up adventures. W hy
not? D irector H arlin was responsible
for “Lethal W eapon” and “Die H ard
2.” This tim e around, he puts wife
Davis into the hero mold.
Davis is strong here as an am nesia
victim, whose form er jo b was as an
assassin/spy for the CIA. A fter a car
accident, she starts to get some pieces
of m em ory back. Soon, people are
trying to kill her left and right.
She plays the “Cybil” role to the
hilt, as each of her personalities fights
for the forefront. Davis is gorgeous as
a bleached blond, and she kicks some
m ajor bootie.
C o-star Sam uel L. Jackson is
equally dynamic. This m an can light
Kerry Hayes/ New Line Cinema
up any movie h e’s in, and he does so
h ere with great dialogue, facial Geena Davis (Samantha Caine) and Samuel L. Jackson (Mitch Henessey) star in
expressions and action hero style. H e

plays a low-rent private detective
who helps Davis find her form er
identity. W hoever picked out the
m a n ’s w ard ro b e should be
praised. The furry hats are a
scream.
The thing that gives this
movie a real kick is the b reak­
neck pacing. H arlin never gives
the audience a chance to question
the reality of a scene, because the
next big action sequence is
already happening. T he only
w eakness of the movie is the
main villain. H e is a form er target
of Davis’, and he likes to use the
same wise-cracking one-liners as
the rest of the cast. H e also
d oesn’t look very villainous. H e is
quite gaunt, and looks as if h e’d
lost every fight h e’s ever been in

“The

Cougars win one, tie one, over weekend
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
Jerry R eed played a big factor when the SIU E
m en’s soccer team nipped Indianapolis and tied St.
Joseph’s this w eekend in a couple of G reat Lakes
Valley C onference games.
The Cougars started the w eekend off Saturday
with a defeat of Indianapolis 2-1 at G uelker Field.
Jason Turkington put the Cougars on the board
first in the 33rd m inute when the Indianapolis goalie
cam e out of the n et to o far for a loose ball.
Turkington showed his aggression by getting to the
ball and putting it past the keeper.
“This was a heads-up play,” said head coach Ed
H uneke. “Jason saw the o p p o rtu n ity and

exploited it.”
Indianapolis tied the gam e at 61:41, but the
Cougars didn’t give up. W ith less than four m inutes
left in the contest, R eed headed in the game winner
off the foot of Turkington.
“Jerry is a clutch player,” said H uneke. “H e has
com e through all season when w e’ve needed him the
m ost.”
D espite the exciting finish, H uneke was disap­
pointed that his team didn’t stick to their initial game
plan.
“I’m happy that we won, but this was an unattrac­
tive win,” said H uneke. “We should have taken
advantage of their m istakes m ore than we did, but
it’s good to win when you’re not playing well.”
O n Sunday afternoon, the Cougars tied another

GLVC team , St. Joseph’s, 1-1 at G uelker Field.
S IU E was down early when St. Joseph’s Tom
Williams dented the back of the net. R eed brought
the Cougars back once again by knotting the game 11 with an unassisted tally. The final whistle blew with
S IU E playing their first tie game
“We showed a lot of character by coming back,”
said H uneke. “I ’m disappointed in the outcom e, but
we followed o u r game plan closer.”
M ike Novak helped SIU E preserve the tie game
with his intense defense.
The Cougars will be back in GLVC action on
Thursday at Missouri-St. Louis.
“ We have som e tough gam es ahead of us,”
H uneke said. “It’s im portant that we play well to fin­
ish out the season.”

Obstacle’s were too big to overcome

Sarah Hardimon lead the way for the Cougars this Fall.

Last year at this time the SIU E w om en’s
tennis team was celebrating their first G reat
Lakes Valley C onference championship.
From this cham pionship team the confer­
ence MVP, Amy Hazen and her sister Sara
were expected to play on the fall team.
A long with the H azen’s, head coach Bill
Logan expected to have, in his opinion, two
talented freshm en coming in to give the
H azen’s a run for their m oney for the top
two positions.
O n paper, the team Logan thought he
would have, was b etter than the cham pi­
onship team.
With that in mind, the Cougars run for a
consecutive title was in their grasp.
Up until the final week of preparation for
the fall season, Logan’s team was intact. But
instead of coming together, it all fell apart.
Am y H azen decided that she didn’t want
to play any m ore and since she was not play­
ing her sister didn’t want to play either. So
the com bo that w on the M id-Am erican
Rolex doubles tournam ent all of a sudden
was not on the roster.
Then one of the freshm en, Yutaka Izutsu,
who probably would of been the team ’s No.

Volleyball loses three in Tampa
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The S IU E volleyball team fell victim to
some tough com petition and went 1-3 this
w eekend at the Tam pa Tournam ent in Tampa,
Fla.
The Cougars faced three team s in the top 25
in the round robin tournam ent starting with
No. 25-ranked Florida Southern on Friday.
S IU E was up early in the first game, but lost
15-10,18-16,15-5.
“We should have beaten Florida S outhern,”
said head coach Sandy Montgomery. “We just
d idn’t get the breaks.”
Next up was Barry, who held a No. 21 ran k ­
ing, and are the defending N ational Cham pions
in Division II.
SIU E gave them a com petitive m atch, but
fell to Barry 15-5,15-10,15-6.
“We gained a lot of experience by facing
Barry,” M ontgom ery said. “They had players

from Russia and China that were very good.”
The Cougars had an easier tim e in their first
m atch on Saturday.
They defeated Rollins 15-12, 15-6, 15-6 to
gain some confidence going into their final
contest against 9th-ranked Tampa.
S IU E gave the host school all they could
handle, but came up short in a 15-10,15-7,15-6
lose.
“We played the best we have played all
w eekend, against Tampa,” M ontgom ery said.
“Being only a second year team, I ’m extremely
pleased with the way we hung in there with a
team in the top ten.”
Michelle G ilm an had 15 kills against Tampa,
and leads the conference in kills and blocks.
“ It’s not easy to play team s in the top 25,”
M ontgom ery said. “W e’re still young and

pleased th at none of our opponents

clearance to play.
“N ot to m ake excuses why we d idn’t do

She ended the season 11-2 and m aking the

Women fall to St. Joseph’s;
Prepare for GLVC Tourney
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
A good first half by the Cougars turned into one of the worst
second halves of the year.
The Cougars looked to go into half time with 1-0 lead but
with a m inute left to play, St. Joseph's tied the game with a goal
of their own.
Then the second half came around and the Cougars looked
like a different team . In the 13 victories the Cougars have won
this year, they have m ade few mistakes, but in the second half
the miscues were there.
“We probably played the worst half of the year. They’re a
real good team , and you just can’t m ake all those mistakes,”
head coach B rian K orbesm eyer said.
The Cougars will now get ready for the GLVC tournam ent
that starts this W ednesday at 7p.m. against Quincy, at home.
“They’re a good team , they started off slow this year but they
have battled back and are at five hundred for the year. We have
to be oii the top of our game,” K orbesm eyer said.
