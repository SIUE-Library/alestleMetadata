Student donate 127 units of blood during Red Cross drive
By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
140 students and faculty members donated blood during the
Red Cross Blood Drive held in the Conference Center in the
UC, Feb. 6-7.
The blood drive was just one of five that the Red Cross
conducts on SIU E ’s campus every year.
The goal of each visit is to collect approximately 70 units of
blood each day, Connan Campbell, coordinator of Greek life,
said.
Campbell also said that the Student Government is the chief
sponsor of Red Cross blood drives every year.
“Student Government has set up a programming fund that
provides advertising and food for the drive,” Campbell said.
“ Other sponsoring organizations provide volunteer hours,
and those sponsors change every year,” Campbell added
The four sponsors for this blood drive were The Black
Student Association, The National Association of Black
Accountants, Alpha Kappa Alpha and Sigma Phi Epsilon
Fraternities. All organizations have provided volunteers in the
past, Campbell said.
“The Red Cross itself provides its support staff, cookies, as
well as other sugary foods and juice,” Campbell said.
The blood drives are conducted over a two-day period, each
day at the same location. However, the location changes each
time they come to campus, Campbell said.

Cassandra Edwards, donor care specialist for the Red Cross,
said that she has been working for the Red Cross for five years.
“ I always wanted to get into the medical profession,”
Edwards said. “My work here is very rewarding.”
Of the students who turned out to give blood, many were not
first-time donors.
“ I love giving blood,” Carmen Barnes, freshman in TV/R,
said. “This is the seventh time I’ve given blood.”
Cathi Tay, a sophomore majoring in special education, said
that this was the third time she had ever given blood.
“The reason I give blood is because if I ever needed it, I
would hope that someone had donated blood for me,” Tay said.
Matt Hicks and Jason Holtgrewe, both sophomores in
electrical engineering, said that it was the seventh time they had
donated blood, and they donate blood because of their
fraternity.
For freshman Priscilla Lundy, it was the first time she gave
blood.
“My friends made it sound like a joy ride,” Lundy said. “ I felt
very queasy. I don’t think I’m going to ever give blood again.”
127 productive units of blood were collected during the
drive.
“ Based on initial records, the percentage of productive units
was much higher for this drive than at other drives at the same
location,” Campbell said.
The next Red Cross blood drive scheduled at SIU E is April
9-10.

Students participate in
political process through
voter registration drive
By David Weil
News Reporter

"|£

A Voter registration drive was held on Monday
and Tuesday in the Goshen Lounge in the University
Center from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The event, sponsored by the Black Student
Association, the University Center Board, the
National Society of Black Engineers, Delta Sigma
Theta and Alpha Kappa Alpha, was designed to
heighten student awareness of their power to vote.
“With the many changes taking place on the
national level, most students are not totally aware of
all the issues affecting them, such as financial aid and
the political changes currently taking place,” Terrace
Gaddy from the B SA said while manning the
registration table on Tuesday.
The drive was a success in signing up
approximately 60 voters in two days.
“I think it was very successful, with students not
just from Madison County, but St. Clair County as
well,” Gaddy said.
Registering to vote is one way students can learn
to participate in the political process. With
government policy constantly changing, students can
voice their desires by voting. The United States
government is an ever-changing process and,

Tuesday as the Supreme Court let stand a redrawn map that reduces the

The action makes it all but certain that the map drawn last year by a federal

year, forcing two of the state’s three black congressmen to run in majority
white districts.
In the order, the justices denied an emergency appeal from voters who

by the Georgia Legislation, under pressure from the Justice Department.

letter to the editor.

Message to Congress: students, not banks
Students from colleges in the Mid-Atlantic area
gathered on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol recently to
voice a simple plea to members of Congress:
“Students, Not Banks!”
Helping students manage their educational debts
is a big reason why the Clinton Administration
supported the creation of a new student loan
program know as direct lending.
Direct lending makes it easier for families to pay
for college by allowing graduates to pay back their
student loads as a percentage of their income. In
addition, direct lending is simple: college student aid
offices issues federal loan funds directly to students,
offering one-stop shopping that means no more trips
to the bank or long lines to turn in loan papers.
Students can choose the repayment plan that best
fits their financial status.
Now in its second year of operation, direct
lending is being hailed as a hit by more than 1,350
participating colleges and almost 2 million student
borrowers.
Who
supports
direct
lending?
Bush
Administration officials first proposed it. The
Clinton Administration and a bipartisan majority in
Congress made it a reality in 1993.
The colleges that enrolled in the program report
that it is working well, as evidenced by the fact that
none of them has asked to get out. The roster of
direct lending schools includes many of the nation’s

most prominent universities, such as Ohio State
University, MIT, Rice University, the University of
Colorado, Harvard University, and the University of
Florida.
More importantly, students who use it love it, too.
One student told “ Rolling Stone” that direct lending
is “the best thing since microwaveable brownies.”
Students say they like having a choice among several
repayment options, rather than having a bank set the
size of their payment.
Borrowers can choose to make smaller payments
in their first years out of school, when they are likely
to earn less. Or, borrowers can choose to set their
monthly payment as a percentage of their income—
a big help for graduates who are just beginning their
careers, starting families, or entering low-paying
public service employment.
So, who opposes direct lending? The financial
middlemen who benefit from the old loan program,
earning billions of dollars each year while assuming
virtually no financial risk. That’s because the
guaranteed loan system gives them a federal
guarantee to replace their money if a borrower
defaults, as well as hefty federal subsidies for
participating in the guaranteed loan program.
The bottom line is that the special interests’
profits are threatened, and their lobbyists have made
clear to Congress that they expect to be protected.
They do not want competition from a new system

that works better.
The leaders of the majority in Congress say that
they are prepared to shrink direct lending or kill it
outright, thereby forcing almost 2 million student
borrowers back into the old system. And when there
is no competition, the incentive to improve the
system for the students and families that use it will
disappear.
The President’s veto blocked the first legislative
attack on direct lending, but the special interests and
their Congressional allies continue to oppose this
improvement in student loans.
Direct lending is a Clinton Administration
priority because it makes it easier for families and
students to pay for college and for students to
further their education. Direct lending embodies
everything that the American people expect today
from their government: less cost to taxpayers, less
red tape, better customer service. This is a case of
special interests vs. students and colleges.
We side with the students and colleges, so that
college officials can choose between the two
programs to decide which one works best for their
students and their institution.
Richard W. Riley
U.S. Education Secretary

Hopefully Akers w ill bring WSIE back to its responsibilities
Along with many others I was surprised by the termination of Roy Gerritsen,
W ISE’s general manager. I know absolutely nothing about the circumstances
and could care less, but, I suspect, some good will come from it.
Let me make my point. Long before Gerritsen came to SIU E, W SIE
essentially served the university community (I even had a weekly spot where I
pontificated on anything current), the community, area, and region.
For example, W SIE gave certain ethnic groups in our area one hour a week
to present news relative to that ethnic group and to play ethnic music—The
Polish Hour and Croatian Melodies come to mind. And so it went—not a huge
listening public, but we were serving the area. And these ethnic groups

wholeheartedly supported and contributed to this university.
Then comes Gerritsen who changed us to largely a “Jazz Format” and most
of the local/’regional air time crashed.
I understand that with this new format our listening audience greatly
increased, but, in my opinion, at a price.
Perhaps Frank Akers, our new GM of W SIE, will take us back somewhat to
our campus/area/regional responsibilities.

Lincoln hod no other alternatives except to free the slaves
Abraham Lincoln was a racist president who did
not want equality for blacks, only signed the
Emancipation Proclamation to save the Union and
allowed blacks into the military because of the
Union’s military position. If it was not for the
demanding impact of the abolitionist movement and
the continuously growing cost of the military, blacks
may not have been freed during Lincoln’s
administration.
According to a debate between Lincoln and
Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln believed that whites
were better than blacks and that blacks would never
be equal to whites. On many occasions during
Lincoln’s tenure as President, he proposed that
blacks emigrate from the United States in order to
alleviate the problem of race relations, which he
tended to blame on fact that blacks were now in this
country.
Lincoln did not free the slaves because he felt that
slavery was wrong or because he did not believe that
man should treat men as property. He actually
resisted the emancipation of slaves. In 1962, ten days
after David Hunter, Union General, issued an order
to have slaves freed in Georgia, Florida and South
Carolina, President Lincoln revoked his order. In a

response to Hunter’s action, Lincoln wrote a letter
saying that neither Hunter or any other commander
was authorized to make proclamations declaring
sales of any state free and that particular
proclamation was void.
The only reason Lincoln gave into the
emancipation was because he was pressured. His
main concern was not for the slave, it was for the
preservation of the Union. When Lincoln agreed to
sign the Emancipation Proclamation, he was only
willing to free some slaves, not all of them. Slaves
were only freed in the rebel states, the slaves in
Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri were
not set free.
His action of freeing the slaves was not a moral
issue, he saw it as a political necessity. In a letter
Lincoln wrote on August 22, 1862, he told of his
major concern, the preservation of the Union and
not the abolition of slavery.
“My paramount object in this struggle is to save
the Union, and is not either to save or destroy
slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any
slave I would do it; and if I do it by freeing some and
leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do
about slavery and the Colored race, I do it because I

If you don't know your past,
you're doomed to repeat it
I am writing in response to the Thursday, Feb. 1,1996 editorial by Brian Jarmy. In his artilce,
Jarmy suggests that the authors of the previous letters concerning Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and Abraham Lincoln missed the point. Jarmy gives the notion that the previous authors are
obsessed with the past and are trying to prove how bad it was. Jarmy also claims that the
authors are wasting their time bickering and arguing.
First of all, being an author of one of those letters, I must set things straight. I ahve not
missed any points about King, Lincoln, or what they stood for. I know all too well. Do you
understande what these men stood for, Jarmy? Do you understand what was mentioned in my
previous letter about Lincoln? Do you truly understand what Kind was about? Do you
understand why there was a White backlash against King just before his death? Maybe you
should look deeper into these areas.
Furthermore, I don’t need to try and prove how bad it was. Facts about the past can stand
on their own. The results of the past are here today. You see, the past causes the present and
the present causes the future. I’m not obsessed with the past, but yes, I am deeply interested in
it.
I want to know why Blacks have a hard time getting jobs, line in crime and poverty, and why
they don’t know themselves. I want to know why Whites are in the position they are in. I want
to know why I don’t see many Native Americans around. I want to know as much about the
past as I can, so that maybe I can try and make a better future. We are living out the past and
in a causé and effect type of world, we all need to correct what is false.
I’m not trying to bicker and argue about the past, I’m just trying to tell the truth about it. If
I’m wrong, please correct me because reality is what I seek, not to put anyone down. If we
continue to blind ourselves with a false history, we have a dangerous future to look forward to.
As far as the comment about King and “Looking forward to getting along with other races,”
I have no problem with getting along with those outside of my own nation, just as long as they
are real and seek truth as well. 1 think a lot of the reason why Kind had to do what he did needs
to be examined. I think it ties in closely with what I have stated.
Lastly, I would like to remind Jarmy of the quote, “If you don’t know your past, you’re
doomed to repeat it.”

Soph., MIS

believe it helps to save the Union...”
The allowing of blacks in the military is yet
another historically crucial decision made by Lincoln
that was not initiated until circumstances finally
forced a revision in his original policy. Lincoln and
his administration had received many letters form
blacks offering to serve in the war. These courageous
black men were anxiously willing to fight as
guerrillas (war term) for the Union even after being
enslaved by the very country they called their own.
Every time a letter was sent, Lincoln would refuse
them. Lincoln decided to allow blacks into the
military only after the fact that the manpower of the
Union army had become crucial.
If it had not been up to Lincoln alone without the
influence of the abolitionists and other factors, such
as the pressure of military expediency, emancipation
might not have occurred during his presidency.
Lincoln did not really care if slaves were freed or
not, and really did not want blacks to serve in the
military. His main reason for allowing these factors
to arise was because he felt he had no other
alternatives.

Issue larger than w ho deserves to have holiday celebrated
I am writing in reference to a letter to the editor by Brian Jarmy. Jarmy makes
reference to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “ I Have A Dream” speech, and
commented that he felt King was “looking forward to the day when people of all
races could get along. This is all wonderful. However, I don’t feel that the two
students who set the record straight about Abraham Lincoln were “missing the
point” by doing such.
Although I, myself, am hot African-American, I can certainly understand the
importance of African-Americans having correct images of history.
Historically, African-Americans have been handed a very edited version of
history (perhaps to help maintain their subordinate positions in society). If
someone has a problem with historical realities being taught, perhaps this person

has something to gain by the feeding of distorted history to African-Americans
and other so-called “minorities.” Voices like Shawn Israel and Anthony Smith
are very important, and we must be sure they continue to be heard.
I do not believe Jarmy had any ill intent when he wrote his letter, but I do feel
he should be a little more aware of current situations that history has deemed
necessary.
This issue is larger than who does or does not deserve to have a holiday
celebrated on his/her birthday.

File 1040-EZ income tax returns
through new IRS Telefile System
Press Release- This tax season 20-30 million Americans will have the opportunity to file their
federal income tax returns by touchtone telephone through an electronic filing system called
Telefile.
Telefile is a free call that may take 6-10 minutes to complete. This automated system,
available in Spanish and English can be accessed any time day or night. Telefile even computes
the caller’s taxes.
The main targets for the service is the student market, and qualified taxpayers who normally
file a 1040-EZ form will receive special Telefile instructions and a Personal Identification
Number (PIN) along with their regular tax booklet.
The tax return is completed when the filer enters a Personal Identification Number (PIN) as
the tax payer’s signature. This PIN and the taxpayer’s social security number also serve as
identification should the taxpayer have future questions about their return.
The entire process is easily handled in a 6 to 10 minute call. There are no forms to send, no
W-2’s, no envelopes or stamps. Since Telefile is entirely electronic, it is the fastest way to expedite
refund checks, which will be received within 21 days.
To be eligible for Telefile, taxpayers must be single with no dependents, have a taxable income
of less than $50,000, have filed a 1040-EZ form previously, live at the same address as last year,
and have received Telefile information in their federal tax booklet mailed to their home.

Dole says government is too involved with education
DAVENPORT, Iowa (A P)— Government must
get out of the education business and teachers must
start demanding more of students, Republican
presidential frontrunner Bob Dole says.
“ Very frankly, 1 think in some cases w e’ve fallen
down on the teacher’s side of the equation,” Dole
told a crowd of about 200 people Monday, about 40
percent of whom were students and teachers from
around Scott County.
“ I have a lot of respect for teachers. But my view
is, w e’ve got to do better. We’ve got people
graduating from high school who can’t find where
Texas is on the map,” he said.
With the Iowa caucuses next Monday, Dole also
touted his experience in Washington compared to
the other eight GOP contenders while also bashing
President Clinton.
“ I think we’re ready for a change. Bill Clinton
said that in 1992, and it worked,” the Kansas
senator said. “ I believe President Clinton thinks he
can talk right and govern left.”
Dole, introduced to the crowd by U.S. Sen.

Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, drew spots of smattered
applause during his 45-minute appearance,
especially on educational topics.
“ We’re failing our children and our
grandchildren because w e’ve given up on
excellence,” the Kansas senator said. “ We’ve got to
return to the three R ’s. It’s not going to happen by
throwing federal money at it. That’s always the
answer.”
Dole also pointed out he voted against the
creation of the Department of Education, opposes
G oals 2000 and doesn’t like outcom e-based
education.
“That’s why some people have gone to home
schooling. They feel their students, their children
aren’t getting the education they need from the
public schools,” he said.
Parents and local officials are best qualified to
run schools and teach children, Dole said. The
federal government should let them, he said.
“ We need to experiment. We need to send more
power back to the schools, get the schools back into
the hands of the parents and others who have a
direct interest,” Dole said. “We do that and I think

you’ll see a significant difference.
“ My view is that secondary and elementary
education ought to be kept at the state and local
level. The less the federal government is involved,
the better. The last thing we want to do is get
involved in every day curriculum.”
D ole also drew applause when he said he
supports English as the nation’s official language
and that he favors voluntary prayer in school, “ not
dictated by the teachers or by the state, but
student-led voluntary prayer.
“You can get together for sports, you can get
together for everything else, what’s wrong with
them getting together for voluntary prayer?”
Dole, noting a number of older people in the
audience, recalled his wartime service, and the 50year anniversary celebrations that gave him the
chance to think about “ the America you risked
your life to protect.”
Speaking of his decision to run for president,
Dole said, “ I just said to myself, ‘Perhaps there’s
one more mission for my generation, maybe one
more call to serve.’ *’

DC report: ‘psychologically harmful’ violence pervasive on TV
WASHINGTON (AP)— A study commissioned
by the cable television industry concludes that
“psychologically harmful” violence is pervasive on
both broadcast and cable TV shows, according to a
published report.
The $1.5 million study, conducted by researchers
at four universities, was based on a sample of 2,500
hours of programming and found that most
programs contain violence portrayed in a
potentially harmful context.
The study, scheduled for released today, was
obtained in advance by The Washington Post.
“The risks o f viewing the most common
depictions of televised violence include learning to

Student's notes
earn money as
study guides
BOULDER, Colo. (AP)—
Philosophy major Chris Hawley
earns more than college credits
for his time in lecture halls at the
University of Colorado.
He works for Mad-Dasher
Notes, a service that buys
lecture notes from students in
large classes, repackages them
and sells them as study guides.
And he said the work helps
him learn the course better.
“Once I started, I realized
that it’s really helped out with
my courses. I just knew the
material because I typed it up
every night,” Hawley said.
Mad-Dasher
and
its
competitor, Gass Notes, cover
most of CU’s larger lecture
courses. Both pay note-takers
from $6 to $9 per lecture and a
good one can earn $500 a
semester.
Mad-Dasher owner Grant
Hendren said the notes are
offered for $30 a semester, $5 a
week or $2.50 for a daily
supplement.
“With Mad-Dasher, students
are not forced to write every
single word down; it allows
them to listen in class instead of
having to be heads-down in a
mad scramble to get all the
words down and it allows us to
fill in the blanks,” Hendren said.
But some academicians are
just a bit leery of the business.
Political science Professor
Doug Costain said note-takers
have violated university policy
by failing to ask his permission
or put notes from his class on
reserve in the library.
“I have allowed them in my
class as a service to my students
when I’m teaching a 400-person
class,” Costain said. “I’m not
real happy about it, but at the
same time I recognize that it’s a
service of value to some
students.”
The CU regents established
the rules requiring professor
permission and distribution of
the notes at the library in 1984.
Associate Vice Chancellor
for Academic Affairs Mark
Dubin said the note-takers
could face university discipline if
they don’t ask professor
permission. But that would be
done only if a professor
complained, and that hasn’t
happened yet, he said.

behave violently, becoming more desensitized to
the harmful consequences of violence and
becoming more fearful of being attacked,” the
study found, according to the Post.
“Thus, there are substantial risks of harmful
effects from viewing violence throughout the
television environment.” the study added.
With funding from the National Cable
Television Association, researchers led by a team a
the University of California at Santa Barbara
found:
•Most acts of violence on television don’t show
the acts’ consequences.
•C haracters who commit violent acts on

television go unpunished 73 percent of the time.
“ When violence
is presented
without
punishment, viewers are more likely to learn the
lesson that violence is successful,” the researchers
wrote.
L ast Septem ber, the four m ajor broadcast
networks touted a U C LA study which found
“ promising signs” in the way the networks portray
violence.
But according to the Post, the cable-funded
study used more rigorous methodology, using
previous studies of TV and behavior to link
different types of violent acts to their known
psychological effects.

SHAG: Not a gig, not just a concert— it's a part/
By Lenon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
It seems to be a shame as to what passes for funk in today’s world. Many
people out there claim to be funky when they really aren’t. MC Hammer
claimed to be the Funky Headhunter. The members of En Vogue were the
Funky Divas. These people may have had funk influences, but they are not
funky in the true sense of the word.
James Brown is funky. Parliament is funky. Sly and the Family Stone is funky.
And yes, SHAG is funky.
SHAG is an eight piece funk band that claims to be from Cincinnati, Ohio.
(They are really from outer space, like any good funk band.) They were
recently at the Hi-Point, and 1 was there to help them spread the word. That
word is love.
As soon as they hit the stage, the party starts. You see, SHAG does not play
gigs. They do not have concerts. They party! You know this because the band
will remind you throughout the evening. Lead singer Duran says, “SHAG is a
party band. We like to party!” (I love it when a band uses the word “party” as
a verb.)
When the first notes of synthesizer open the show, the crowd waits in
anticipation for the rest of the band to appear on stage. When they do, the result
is a sound that will get any Parliament fan out of their seat and on the dance
floor. For ninety minutes, the band takes you on a trip through the universe
filled with love, energy, and funk catch phrases. They didn’t tear the roof off, but
they did light it on fire and let it burn for the rest of the show. It doesn’t really
matter what you do while on this trip, because Duran tells you, “ If it feels good,
it’s all right.”
People have favorite members of bands they like. Most people have a
favorite Beatle. My friend Eric has a favorite Bottlerocket. And I have a
favorite member of SHAG. The man is named Free Bass, so you can probably
guess what instrument he plays. It’s not just any bass, however. It’s a mutron
bass. (I’m not quite sure where he got it, but I think he found it in outer space.)

and self-confidence 1 once did.

Free Bass and Duran, the front men of SHAG, party hard with their audience.

A t one point in the show, Free Bass got up and told the crowd, “There’s a
revolution goin’ on. It’s not about being a republican or a democrat. It’s about
being a human being.”
While at the show, you can buy the Shag CD, titled “Bootsy Collins i resents:
SHAG Live.’’ The album was recorded and produced by Bootsy, (who, by the
way, is also from outer space.) It’s a live recording, but it still sounds great. It
makes you want to see the band every time they come through town, which is
every two to three months.
Listening to the disc can’t substitute seeing the band live, but it can tide you
over until they’re in St. Louis again. If you don’t want to wait, you can buy the
disc at Streetside Records. Look for it under Shag and/or Bootsy Collins
because they don’t always know where to place it.
Once you know the songs, you will be ready for the next time. Get plenty of
sleep, because the band will tell you that “ a Shag party is lasting all night long.”

LO S A N G E L E S (AP) Elizabeth Taylor is divorcing hubby No. 7.
The Academy Award-winning actress filed for divorce Monday from Larry Fortensky. This is
Fortensky’s third divorce and Taylor’s eighth: She was married to Richard Burton twice.
Taylor’s other husbands were hotel heir Conrad “Nicky” Hilton, actor Michael Wilding,
Broadway producer Mike Todd, singer Eddie Fisher, and Virginia Sen. John Warner.
Taylor, 63, and Fortensky, 43, met in 1988 at the Betty Ford Clinic, where both were being
treated for substance abuse. They married in 1991 in a lavish ceremony at Michael Jackson’s
ranch in Santa Barbara, but separated in August.
NEW Y O R K (AP) Sharon Stone sees different curves ahead in her career.
The actress who capitalized on a gorgeous face and killer body in her breakthrough movie
“Basic Instinct” is viewing alternate paths to stardom as she approaches middle age.
“ If I knew then what I know now, I think it’s not a great idea to do nudity,” Stone says in the
March issue of Vanity Fair.
Stone, who will turn 38 next month, said she wants to be known for more than her nude scenes.
The actress already has started moving away from the sex kitten personae that has been her
bread and butter. She won a Golden Globe for best actress for her performance in “Casino.”
ATLANTA (AP) Jane Fonda used videotapes to teach adults exercise— now she’s appearing
live to fight teen pregnancy.
Fonda is battling a proposal before the Georgia Senate that would postpone lessons about
condoms until high school and bar sex education before the fifth grade.
“ If this bill comes out of committee and passes, there will be more pregnancies, more sexually
transmitted diseases, and the need for abortions will go up,” Fonda said Monday.
Noting that the abortion rate in the United States has skyrocketed while abortions have
dropped in European countries that emphasize sex education, Fonda said, “ We need to learn
from these experiences instead of playing Russian roulette with our young people.”
Despite the star-powered protest, the bill passed the Senate subcommittee Monday by 3-2. It
must be approved by the full Education Committee before moving to the Senate floor.
ST. H ELEN A , Calif. (AP) First came velvet Elvis. Now there’s vintage Elvis— smooth,
harmonious and elegant with a ripe, juicy, complex berry taste.
The ghostly image of the late king of rock ‘n’ roll is hidden in the label of “ Graceland, First
Vintage,” a 1993 premium cabernet sauvignon scheduled to appear on wine store shelves this
week.
When the bottle is turned on its side Elvis’ face emanates from the lavender-colored label.
The wine was made in cooperation with Priscilla Presley and the Graceland estate.

“ Black History Month is also being geared
toward all students and their intellect. We’re
including inclusive types of programs were people of
other cultures can learn about our culture. We’ve
been here for 400 years, isn’t it time to meet us?”
Nance said.

For almost 30 years,

and
leadership for AfricanAm erican
students.
Included under the
group’s um brella are
17
organizations
ranging
from

and
business students.

great and not-so-great things about issues AfricanAmericans are concerned with.
“The greatest joy for me is serving as a role model
for all students—particularly for African-American
students. It forces me the opportunities to teach
African-Americans to be their best at all times at
any situation,” Jackson said. “I am disappointed in
the lack of participation from African-Americans in
that some have forgotten about what other people
have done to get them into institutions like
universities. They forget about the loss of life and
loose limbs. 1 feel that we all can attribute something
to the B SA ,” Jackson said.
What about those who believe black

organizations are no longer needed-especially on
campuses. Nance had an answer to this controversial
question.
“America is founded on special interests groups.
We are a special interest. Blacks on predominately
white colleges have different needs. We (BSA )
attempt to provide what is needed in bridging the
gap of loneliness— situations such as one black
student in a class, we try to eliminate the alienation,”
Nance said.
Not only is the organization visible during Black
History Month but
provide projects all
during the school year.
“We are presently
working with the new
vice-chancellor
in
recruiting high school
students and bringing
them to the university.
We’re
showing
students
what
is
required of them. This
is a program we would
like
to
see
implemented,” Nance
said.
Nance and Jackson
also said that B SA
continues its effort in
making sure of the
hiring of AfricanAmerican professors
for the university to
commit to retaining
and
graduating
minority students—
especially
AfricanAmerican students.
B SA means many
things to different
people.
19-year-old
James Earl Little II, of
Tower Lake, describes
what the B SA means
to him.
“The B SA draws
people together and by
drawing
people
together it gives them
a better relationship.
In
turn
the
relationship grows as a
family with other
organizations. It’s been
an
excellent
experience for me,” Little said.
One new member, Clarence Lang, 22, a graduate
student from the University of Missouri majoring in
history, can see a difference that the organization
makes on this campus.
“The campus I was at previously was pretty
dysfunctional. What impresses me is a regularity of
the BSA . They are consistent in what they do at the
meetings and programs being done,” Lang said.
A s Black History Month and reflection of great
African-Americans continues, the Black Student
Association will further their efforts to bridging the
gap, keeping the unity, and providing a home to
those individuals who might otherwise feel lonely.

Commentary
By Darryl Howlett

A l e s i l e

I am so glad that the arctic cold has left the
area. 1 came home Friday from school at 5
p.m. and did not leave my house until 8:30
a.m. Monday morning. Not that it was just the
cold (I had to wear two pair of LC D ’s this
weekend), but more to the fact that I had a
nasty cold.
I’m sure all of you know what I’m talking
about—where you can’t go to sleep because
either your nose is runny or your nasal
passages are so blocked that you can only
breathe through your mouth. I was so
uncomfortable but it did give me time to see
what actually comes on TV late at night—real

iate.
From two in the morning to five, late night television is only for those who
have colds or people who had too much spicy food for dinner; everyone else
on the planet is either sleeping or doing other entertaining and fulfilling
things. They really have some lost commercials and shows on at night.
There is one commercial where this guy talks about his store and some
men sing in the background nothing but “Stan, Stan, Stan, Stan.” And I’m

Page 1 5

thinking to myself, “ what did Stan do, give them a winning lottery ticket?”
And then there are those “ I- 8OO-HAVE-A-GOOD-TIME” commercials
with women who say if you’re lonely, call them to have a good time. I would
love to see how those women really look when you dial those numbers.
L et’s not forget all those damn psychic informercials. The one I saw this
past weekend had Phillip Michael Thomas of “ Miami Vice” fame hosting it.'
H e’s saying how good these psychics are and this and that. Once again I asked
myself, “ If your life is so good, why on God’s green Earth are you only doing
psychic commercials?”
The last of the crazy commercials deal with the local people. You know,
like those guys from Schweig-Engel acting like court jesters? And speaking
of royalty, how about the two queens of the carpet court flying over the
mighty Arch? And don’t forget the catchy tune of “Think Young, Rodney D.
Young?”
Other entertainment that I found amusing were repeats of Ricki Lake (I
turned the channel) and Hawaii Five-O. Yes! Hawaii Five-O! Man, I hadn’t
seen that in ages. I got real hyper about that. Brought me back to yesteryear
of Barnaby Jones, the Rockford Files and my main man Kojak. (You all know
he and Tssac Hayes were the original bald heads)
Oh well, so much for late, late night television. I’m over my cold, and
won’t see the likes of it for quite awhile.

Tau Gamma Chapter
Presents its 5th Annual
Lecture Series/ Merchants Exposition
This year’s lecture series has the promise to be as entertaining and
as enlightening as the ones in years past. Those in the past includ­
ed the controversial teachings of Stokely Carmicheal, now known
as Quame Ture, who gave us an insight how our society is and what
is necessary for us as black youths to
prepare for the system. We also hosted
Conrad M uham m ad, the Youth Director
of the Nation of Islam and leading
minister representing the Nation, who
made us think about the importance of
sticking together as a black community
as well as giving us some education
on Islam.
This year we will embrace the teachings
of Dr. Leonard Jeffries. Dr. Jefferies is an
outspoken African Historian, scholar,
educator and social activist. He has
written numerous books and articles challenging the status quo of
African and Black studies throughout the American educational
systems. W ho knows what we will learn from the presentation of
this highly renowned educator? Its best to be there to find out.

Henderson’s hustle pays off for himself and Cougars
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor

By Jeremy Paschall/A/esf/e
Ronnie Henderson brings mental toughness and a hard
working attitude to the floor every night for the Cougars.

In the dictionary, the word hustle is defined
as, “to gain by energetic effort.” Next to that
definition should be a picture of SIU E
basketball player Ronnie Henderson.
Through his hustle, Henderson gained a
spot on the Cougar team this year as a walk-on
player and after the loss of some players,
Henderson found himself hustling his way into
the Cougars starting lineup as an undersized
center.
At 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and playing center,
Henderson can’t afford to quit hustling any
time soon.
Being listed as a guard in the Cougar media
guide and playing forward most of his
basketball career at Cairo High School and
Shawnee Community College, Henderson said
he never pictured himself playing center for
the Cougars.
“The biggest difference in playing center is
going against guys five or six inches taller and
10 to 15 pounds heavier than I am,”
Henderson said after practice Tuesday night.
“ ...I have to work harder and get physical. My
strength helps me a lot.”
A fter playing a reserve role early in the
season, Henderson was thrown into his current
starting position when the team lost Chris

Cougars have uphill battle C
in their final seven games or

By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter

The SIU E women's basketball team has surprised many
followers with their performance this season. With only one
senior, the Lady Cougars have posted a 12-7 record overall. But
the war is far from over.
“The scary thing is that we’ve played all of the easy teams
early in the season,” said assistant coach Nancy Swain Tuesday
afternoon, “GUr last five games are against teams that have
already beaten us early in the year. Any win that we can get out
of those five remaining games will be huge for us.”
The Lady Cougars have seven remaining games with five of
them tobe played at home.
“ We’ve done a lot of learning this year. But I’m satisfied with
the team’s play,” said Swain. “ You can always look back and find
games that you should have won.”
Junior Amy Tuetken has been one of many stars on the team
this season.
“Amy has been very versatile for us,” said Swain. “For her size
she handles the ball well and for her lack of height she plays
inside well. She has great hands in terms of shooting which lets us
put her at either the three or four spot.”
The lone senior Terri Evans and sophomore Alicia Harkins
are the 1-2 offensive punch that has ignited the Lady Cougars
throughout the season.
Swain commented, “ Both are consistent players. One seems to
pick up the play of the other.”
At this point the Ladies are out of the top three positions in
the Great Lakes Valley Conference that move on to the playoffs
come post season.
“ We play a lot of the teams that are currently ahead of us in
the standings, so every game is crucial,” said Swain.
The next game for SIU E will be against Lewis at the
Vadalabene Center tonight. Tip-off is set for 5:30 p.m..
“This is a game that we should be able to win,” said Swain.
The Cougars are currently in seventh place in the conference
with a record of 7-6 and any win they can get down the stretch
will certainly help.

The Cougar Corner is a bit crowded this
week as 6-foot-8, 200 pound, Tim Thorsen
bullies his way in for the first time this year.
It's tough enough to play ball in the GLVC
but imagine doing it as a freshman after
sitting out your senior season in high school
due to injury. That’s exactly what this diaper
dandy center has done. Thursday night at
IUPU-Fort Wayne, Thorsen turned in a solid
performance with 3 made field goals, 5 made
free throws, and 4 rebounds.
Thorsen is not the focal point of the
Cougars offense but is expected to intimidate
opponents down low.
“I’m trying to become more aggressive, “
Tim said. “When I came to college I was a bit
soft, but I’ve been working with Nate (Kreke)
and Ronnie (Henderson) and they’ve helped
me a lot. The guys are counting on me to play
a bigger role on the team especially
rebounding. Coach tells us that when we out
rebound the other teams we win, so that is
what we need. “
When asked about how it feels now to be
the small fish in a big pond again Thorsen said
a lot of it is mental.
“My skills haven’t changed so much , but
my attitude has gotten a lot better. It’s tough
but it’s just another challenge. It’s kind of
exciting trying to get better and play at this
level. “ And if he keeps improving at this rate
he’ll have no problem playing at this level.
Congratulations Tim.

Brefeld to an injury and a few other players
were lost to suspensions over the holiday
break.
“ Ronnie was forced to play...and has come
through in most respects,” Cougar Head coach
Jack Margenthaler said.
Henderson enters action tonight for the
Cougars against Lewis averaging just under 10
points and four rebounds a contest, not bad
numbers for a man who came to the Cougars
as an almost unknown.
“ I had never seen him play before, but he
has been a real good addition to this team,”
Margenthaler said.
Even with the success he has experienced
on the offensive end, both Henderson and his
coach realize that his defense could be
improved.
Henderson said his defense is the biggest
weakness in his game and M argenthaler
agrees.
“He has never been taught the fundamental
concepts of defense,” Margenthaler said. “As a
result he is caught out of position a lot.”
Margenthaler said that he feels the biggest
positive Henderson brings to the Cougars is
mental toughness and Henderson once again,
agrees with his coach.

Perfection. That’s what the Cougar Comer
likes and that’s why Beth Brown is this weeks
women’s representative, in the corner.
Last Thursday against IUPU-Fort Wayne,
Brown just couldn’t miss. Beth was a perfect
nine for nine from the field and also managed
two steals and an assist before fouling out.
Unfortunately, B eth ’s 18 points weren’t
enough to keep the Cougars from falling to
IUPU-Fort Wayne.
In an interesting interview in which Beth
was monitored by her roommate Alicia
Harkins and the Cougar basketball radio
personality Darin Pritchett, she had this to
say about the game Thursday.
“ It was one of those things where I wasn’t
focusing on my shot, I was just doing it. If we
would’ve gotten off to a better start the game
could have had a better outcome. We’ve had a
hard time starting games recently and I think
it’s a mental thing,” Brown said.
Brown’s mentality has also changed a bit
this year.
“ i ’ve changed my attitude from the
beginning of the year, “ she said. “ It was hard
because I’ve started everywhere else I’ve
been and when I came here I wasn't starting.
I’ve had to adjust.
One of those other places Beth was talking
about was Kankakee College in Kankakee,
111., where last year she was a member of their
Division II Junior College National
Championship team. Congratulations on a
fine game Beth.

Henderson---------------------from previous page
“With starting, I have to be
mentally ready every game.
Coach can only do so much to
prepare us for the game, we
have to be ready to play,”
Henderson said.
Although he is listed as a
senior, Henderson still has
one sem ester of athletic
eligibility remaining and he
will be use that during the
spring sem ester of next
season when the Cougars go
through their Great Lakes
Valley Conference schedule.
Henderson will be looking
forward to that and hopes the
Cougars will do better than
they have this season.
Even though the team
hasn’t done as well as
Henderson had anticipated,
he does not point any fingers
or make any excuses. He
looks at every game and
examines his own individual
performance and how he can
improve it.
“ Ronnie’s not looking to
be a star,” Margenthaler said.
“ H e’s just looking to help the
team.”
Once Henderson is done
with his basketball career, he
will pursue a master’s degree
in educational administration
and hopes to be a history
teacher in the future. As far as
the possibility of coaching
basketball goes, Henderson
said he wouldn’t mind doing
it, but he’s not going that
route. He said its a tough job
and don’t know how he would
do.
If he could install in his
players the mental toughness
and hustling attitude he
brings to the floor every
night, he would do just fine.

The date for the
SIUE intramural
program's
women's sports

new date and
