Students and staff were
ushered into the basement of
the University Center as tornado
sirens sounded Monday afternoon.
A series of severe weather
warnings
were
reported
throughout
Southwestern
Missouri and Southern Illinois as
several tornados hit counties in
Missouri and Illinois.
The tornado was reported
over the radio to have hit in
Granite City and St. Louis. At
press time, there were no actual
reported hits in Edwardsville.
The alarms sounded on the
campus around 6 p.m. All people
present in the building were
ordered to go downstairs towards
the back of the building near the
bowling alley. Approximately 40
people waited in the recreational
area of the University Center till
the building engineer confirmed
that the emergency was over.
Some students sat against the
walls and waited, while others
gathered around the television set
to watch the news updates.
The electricity went off
briefly, but returned to power in
less than a minute.
Around 6:30 p.m., students
were alerted by the building
engineer, Patrick Kelly, that the
worst was over, and that they
could leave.
Some were frightened by the
circumstances, but almost all were
pleased with the university staff’s
quick and calm thinking.
Cheryl Heard,
assistant
director of the Kimmel Leadership
Center, was in the University
Center at the time of the severe
weather warning and was
impressed by the staff’s quick
thinking.
“I felt the evacuation was
well performed,” Heard said.

Eagle Scouts, athletes, honor students charged with trashing house
LEAWOOD, Kan. (AP) —
They came from both sides of
the Missouri-Kansas line: Eagle
Scouts, athletes, honor roll
students at some of the Kansas
City area’s most prestigious
high schools.
Now, these “good kids” are
among
those
accused
of
involvement in an incident of
almost incredible vandalism at a
luxury home in this affluent
suburb. And at least some could
face jail time if convicted.
So far, 14 young people have
been charged in connection with
the beer party that drew almost
200 people to a vacant $300,000
home last month. By the time
police broke it up, the damage
ran to an estimated $70,000.
Walls were broken out,
windows and other glass
shattered. Paint was sprayed on
walls, floors and carpeting.
Ten of the
14 had
surrendered by Saturday on
charges of burglary and criminal
damage to property. The
investigation continues, and
police expect 10 to 15 more
people to be charged.
“For the most part they are
good kids who got involved in
a situation that many of our
high school and college students

face today,” said Leawood police
Sgt. Craig Hill. “It just goi out
of hand.”
Hill added, however, “There
are no ifs, ands or buts about it.
What they did was against the
law. There is no excuse for it.”
Those charged — 13 males,
one female — range in age from
16 to 22. They live in Overland
Park, Leawood, Lenexa and
Prairie Village on the Kansas
side, and in Kansas City,
Independence and Lee’s Summit
in Missouri.
Police have learned that
many at the party were students
at Rockhurst High School, a
prestigious Jesuit school in
Kansas City, Mo., and at
Shawnee Mission East High
School in affluent Johnson
County, Kan.
Another is from Grandview
High School in Missouri.
Several students from St. Thomas
Aquinas and Notre Dame de
Sion high schools also attended
the party, along with several
college students.
Johnson County District
Attorney Paul Morrison has
said he would seek jail time for
those responsible for organizing
the party.
Hill, supervisor of the

Leawood Police Department’s
investigations unit, has talked to
many of the students and their
parents. While a few parents have
been defensive and in denial
about
their
children’s
involvement, Hill said, most are
upset, concerned and sorry.
“And they’re not going to
cut their kids any slack,” he said.
“They are truly upset about
what happened.”
Hill said the incident
shouldn’t be a reflection on any
particular school. Young people
in any city in the country take
part in large beer parties, he said.
Officials at Rockhurst High
School are taking the allegations
seriously.
“I know a lot of schools
would prefer to just turn
their backs on it,” said the
Rev. Thomas Pesci, president
of the Jesuit prep school. “We
will be taking disciplinary action
next week.”
Pesci said he didn’t yet know
the number or extent of
Rockhurst students’ involvement,
and could not say what
punishments might be given.
“I’m sure when all is said
and done, there will be a whole
range of disciplinary actions
taken,” including probation,

suspension
and,
possibly,
expulsion, he said.
Rockhurst students, too, are
taking the incident to heart.
“Sometimes it seems the bad
choices made by a few people
reflect on everyone and that’s
sad,” said Timothy G. Haake,
president of the Rockhurst
student council. “Rockhurst
teaches us to be responsible for
our actions and to be proud of
them. No one thinks this situation
is funny, and anyone involved
needs to pay the consequences.”
Public school students in
Kansas who are accused of
felonious conduct off school
property can be suspended or
expelled, said Donna Whiteman,
an attorney for the Kansas
Association of School Boards.
But until students are convicted
in court, the burden of proof for
expulsion would lie with the
school districts.
Once convicted of felonies,
students can be expelled.
Hill said he hoped young
people and parents would learn
lessons from the incident.
“Some of the students I’ve
talked to say they’ll never
attend another party like that,”
Hill said. “They don’t want to go

through what they see these kids
going through.”
At the vandalized house,
carpenter Walter Johnson was
patching walls in the living room
Friday. He and his crew spent last
week plugging holes, including
one created with a small sailboat
that still lies on the floor.
Upstairs, the cigarette butts
have been picked out of the
marble bathtub. Broken windows
have been boarded up, and some
spray-painted images are gone.
New carpet has been ordered for
the ravaged basement.
“We’ve been doing a little bit
of this here and there,” Johnson
said. “But there’s still a lot more
work to be done.”

Big capitalist, little capitalist: Letters to the editor
News Corporation V. Bad Boy Featuring letters from all around campus with some advice on how to save
Reginald Jones might be discussing the wmng capitalist in his speech.
When walking across the Quadrangle a few
days ago, I noticed a sign written in chalk on the
pavement that screamed the question, “Why is Puff
Daddy a Capitalist?” And the first thing that popped into
my mind was, when did Mr. Sean “Puffy” Combs
Danielle become the definition of capitalism in America? Why
Belton Puff Daddy?
I’m sure he was chosen to gain an AfricanAmerican audience. After all, the function is being sponsored by the
College Republicans and is affiliated with another young
conservative organization. Both not exactly known for rousing up
the black population of our campus. Being that Puffy would be a
more recognizable name, versus another capitalist like media mogul,
Rupert Murdock, is probably why it was chosen for the title of
Reginald Jones’s lecture.
The only problem I had with the title was the Puff Daddy part.
If Bad Boy records went under tomorrow, there would be no strikes,
no picketing, no substantial layoffs that would harm the American
economy, no dip in the Dow Jones, it would be lucky if it even got
printed in the Alestle. But if Rupert Murdock decided he was selling
his news corporation empire (consisting of hundreds of media
outlets including the Fox television network, 20th Century Fox, and
the New York Post) it would be on every television set in the nation,
economists would estimate how this selling of such large influence
and stature would effect American’s and how they get their news.
Puff Daddy may be a capitalist, but he’s not a very important
one. He’s not one anyone should be worried about, he doesn’t even
impress me. Don’t get me wrong, I have respect for anyone who is
able to succeed in our democratic/capitalist society which involves
the ongoing rule that the rich must stay rich and the poor must stay
poor in order for it to work.
I’m actually quite curious as to what Reginald Jones has to say,
though I have a slight feeling I probably won't agree with him, being
I’ve heard some of his views before. But I believe that they are
worth listening to. We all should see what the opposing viewpoint
has to say once and a while. It might give me something to write
about. But I suggest that everyone be skeptical. Always take all
information with a grain of salt. That way you’ll know the difference
between a person surviving and succeeding in a capitalist society
(Sean Combs) versus a person with power and influence in a
capitalist society (Rupert Murdock). Make sure you always know
who the real money makers are, and sleep with one eye open.

the inner cities and some more presidential criticism o f “Rants and R aves.”
Inner City Values
It is obvious that the living
conditions and morale levels in
many of America’s inner cities
are deplorable and detrimental
not only to these cities’
inhabitants, but in effect to our
entire country. Surely economic
structure is not the only reason
behind
these
unfortunate
conditions, but it is an important
and often overlooked problem.
The under-credited citizens
in these cities are not allowed to
express and explore their
individual talents and abilities as
they instead get caught up in a
state of government oppression.
This oppression comes as a result
of too many government imposed
social programs that are intended
to assist these Americans in
attaining a means for survival in a
harsh
environment.
These
programs become barriers that
actually encourage people to
settle for less and impair their
ability
to
find
quality
employment. What then should
be done to save our inner cities?
The key is economic
freedom, a free market system
in which individuals can use
their own personal incentive
to succeed. Such a system would
take inner city economies out
of the trenches and into a
better state-of-living, improving
life there and across our
great country.
On Wednesday, April 15 at
7:30 p.m., a man who knows first
hand how successful this
approach to living can be will
greet the SIUE campus. Reginald
Jones,
Bronx
native
and
successful entrepreneur, will
explain detailed solutions to
ending inner city strife in a
lecture entitled, “Why Puff
Daddy is a Capitalist.” Attendees
of this free event will be offered
realistic solutions to serious

problems and will be awakened
to the harm too many government
programs are causing in our
country. Mr. Jones knows, as do
all successful Americans, that the
key to success is not a highspending government, but rather
a combination of freedom, hard
work and personal perseverance.

Intimate Relations
Revisited
I am writing in response to
Matt Gross and Corey Stulce. As
a personal friend and colleague of
Matt’s I can attest to his
impeccable record
as
an
upstanding citizen. I have worked
with Matt, I formed a college
organization with Matt and I am
friends with Matt. He is always
thoughtful and considerate. Matt
sets a fine example as president
of College Republicans. As a
member
of
the
College
Republicans, I have every right to
delve into Matt’s life. If he is
doing something wrong, I, as a
person who voted him into office,
have a right to know. If he is
doing something wrong then I am
going to call him on it, and take
the appropriate action. I will be
taking over the presidency of the
College Republicans in the next
couple of months and I fully
expect to be held to the same
standard that I impose on Matt.
Let me address Corey Stulce
now. Your flippant attitude
towards
infidelity
is
disheartening. I am not interested
in knowing every intimate detail
of Clinton’s sex life. However, I
am interested in knowing if he is
an adulterer. We should all hold
our highest government official
to equally high standards. I feel
that the president of the United
States should be a moral person.

Speech Communications
Vice President
College Republicans

More Intimate Relations
First of all, Ms. Currier, I
was not attempting to discredit
Mr. Gross or accuse him of any
wrongdoing. I was just trying to
prove a point. Apparently, the
SIUE
College
Republicans
believe that once someone is
appointed into office, their
private lives become virtually
non-existent. 1 don’t think that
is necessarily right. I will say
again that I do not agree with
infidelity, but I also do not
believe it is anyone’s business but
the cheater and the person they
are cheating on.
Who are you to judge
anyone’s morals, Ms. Currier?
Just because you have been
elected to a vice president’s
position on a small Illinois
campus, you have the audacity to
judge another man, our president
of the United States. I didn’t
realize such power had been
awarded to you.
I don’t see what leading the
country and having extra-marital
affairs h av e. to do with one
another. I don’t think the
president is elected as an exact
model of how all Americans
should live their lives. I know I
don’t wake up each morning
wondering what Bill Clinton is
having for breakfast and attempt
to eat the same. If this is
something that you need, I
suggest you re-evaluate your life.
I hope this matter is closed.

Inspector General sides with Alaska National Guard whistleblower
ANCHORAGE
(AP)
—
Alaska Air National Guard Maj.
Frederick “Dutch” Overly isn’t
shy about pointing out problems
in the guard. In the past five years
he has accused a half dozen
officers of breaking laws and
military regulations.
He has earned enemies in the
guard’s upper ranks and a
reputation as a whistleblower
who some say is wrong as often
as he’s right. But when his
commanders began a bid to end
his military career, Pentagon
investigators sided with him.
Top commanders in the guard
violated federal whistleblower
protections by retaliating against
Overly after he complained to the
Pentagon, the governor’s office
and members of Congress,
according to two Air Force
Inspector General reports, one
from last summer and the other
finished in late March,
According to the report,
commanders gave Overly a poor
job evaluation in 1996, yanked
his security clearance, moved
him from wing executive officer
to a logistics jobs and tried to
drum him out of the service.
Commanders have since
repaired some of the damage. No
mention of the attempt to toss
him out of the military will
appear in his records, and he has
gotten his security clearance
back.
Overly’s civilian attorney,
Kurt Autor, wants to see him
given back his old job as
executive officer for the 176th
Wing at Kulis Air National Guard

Base in Anchorage. Overly also
deserves back pay for a
promotion to lieutenant colonel
he was due to receive several
years ago, Autor says.
Overly has spent more than
$60,000 in attorneys and
investigators fees defending
himself, Autor said.
Jim Chase, a retired Air Force
major who now heads the
Department of Military and
Veterans Affairs governmental
affair office, does not dispute the
Inspector General’s findings.
But Chase said he does not
know what else the guard can do
for Overly. He’s up for promotion
to lieutenant colonel this summer,
and that will proceed through
regular channels.
“There’s no harm. He’s
claiming, which is erroneous,
that being in a different job
would prohibit him from being
promoted,” Chase said.
“To say there are no remedies
is false,” Autor said. “It reflects
an arrogance that is just
unbelievable.”
Autor sees the guard’s
behavior as part of a pattern of
retaliation against soldiers and
airmen who aren’t part of an
“old-boy network.”
One way to be outside that
network, Autor says, is to go on
the record complaining about
how the guard operates.
A board of inquiry that
examined the guard in 1995, a
few weeks after Gov. Tony
Knowles took office, heard some
unflattering testimony about race
relations, training and cronyism.

Autor says many guard members
who complained to that board
have either retired or were forced
out by retaliation.
“The IG’s report is really the
first time that there will be public
exposure to the nature of the
problem,” Autor said.
So why did guard leaders go
to such lengths to quiet a critic?
“It’s because there’s a
corporate culture ... that’s been
perpetuated by the senior
leadership of the Alaska National
Guard that this kind of approach
is successful,” Autor said.
That’s not how the guard sees
it. True, they shouldn’t have tried
to throw Overly out of the
military for making what later
were
ruled
"protected”
communications by the Inspector
General.
But Maj. Gen. Jake Lestenkof,
the head of the Alaska National
Guard, said a review of Overly’s
case indicates commanders
weren’t out of line when they
recommended ending his career.
“There
was
enough
(questionable) conduct on the
part of Maj. Overly to take this
action,” Lestenkof said.
Even his critics acknowledge
that Overly, 45, is skilled in his
duties as a logistics plans officer
with the 176th Wing.
“He was always a very eager
officer, very eager to serve,” said

Capt. Mike Haller, an Alaska
National Guard spokesman.
But when Overly complained
about the way the guard spent
money, handled promotions and
favored some officers over
others, senior officers had had
enough.
A year ago he was told
discharge proceedings were
being prepared. The move was
being made, his commanders told
him, because his trustworthiness,
loyalty and integrity were
suspect.
The
discharge
board
eventually recommended that the
guard retain him but give him a
letter of admonishment for
publicly
criticizing
fellow
officers in front of a high-level
Pentagon
visitor.
Overly
delivered what he called " a
talking paper” to Defense
Department
Undersecretary
Debra Lee in July of 1995, during
an open forum with Lee.
More than that, guard officials
say Overly and a small group of
his colleagues, some now retired,
have been trying to put one of
their own in the guard’s top spot.
Overly was one of the
founding members of the Militia
Association of Alaska, a group
formed in late 1994 that asked
Gov.-elect Knowles to order the
resignations of all guard officers,
who then would be reviewed for

reappointment. It also wanted
Knowles to establish protections
against favoritism in promotions,
among other requests.
Chase also says Overly’s
record as a whistleblower is
spotty.
For instance, when he
anonymously
tipped
off
Lestenkof in 1996 that a top
Alaska Air National Guard
commander was having an affair
with a woman in his command,
that commander was forced to
retire.
But Chase said a letter Overly
sent anonymously several years
earlier, outlining a litany of
financial and other allegations
against some officers, was a
collection
of
lies.
An
investigation couldn’t find a basis
for any of the charges.
"Nothing wrong with wanting
to run the show, but when you go
out to smear everyone who’s on
the short list, and tell lies about
them ... I don’t know,” Chase
said.
Overly says the reprisals
haven’t stopped, and that he still
is being given menial task. “The
intimidation is overwhelming.
You’ve got to be here to
understand it,” he said. “I’m still
a pariah and no remedies have
been offered to me.”

Country’s largest for-profit educator stirring controversy
NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) —
Jordan Feltes is 3. He likes
playing with plastic helicopters,
singing “Wheels on the Bus” and
listing his favorite animals in
flawless Spanish.
In a neighboring room,
Shannon Smith’s kindergarten
class is sorting colors and shapes
on a computer spreadsheet and
learning phonics.
Jordan and Shannon are two
of the brightest students at the
110-pupil
Chesterbrook
Academy
in
suburban
Philadelphia. Their progress is
monitored by their parents,
teachers and thousands of
stockholders who have invested
in Nobel Education Dynamics
Inc., the largest for-profit school
operator in the country.
Nobel, based in Media, Pa.,
runs 130 schools in 13 states,
with capacity to educate about
20,000 pupils from preschool
through
eighth
grade.
Throughout the country, there are
about 1,100 private, for-profit
schools for that age group — or
less than 1 percent of all schools.
There are about 83,000 public
schools and about 27,000 private
nonprofit schools.
Nobel’s advanced curriculum

A

and long hours — schools are
open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. —
make it popular with middleincome working parents. Tuition
ranges from $4,500 to $6,000 a
year; and classes always have
fewer than 20 students.
“I never even thought about it
(being for-profit) or even knew
about it,” said Karen Smith,
whose daughter, Shannon, has
attended Chesterbrook since she
was 9 weeks old. “She’s just
getting an excellent education.
She wouldn’t be getting this at
another preschool or at public
school.”
Despite
Mrs.
Smith’s
enthusiasm,
educators
say
bringing capitalism to the
classroom could ruin learning as
we know it.
“With a not-for-profit, the
decisions are going to be made
based on what is best for the
institution and what is best for the
students ... (not based) on which
way the financial winds are
blowing,”
said
Margaret
Goldsborough, spokeswoman for
the National Association of
Independent Schools, which only
represents nonprofit schools.
Goldsborough warned that
while profits are high, students

NORMAL, 111. (AP) — It
started with a college cliche: a
drunken scuffle at a Saturday
night fraternity party.
But this time, the hard feelings
didn’t fade as the next day’s
hangovers kicked in. Instead,
police say, they festered and
inspired a brutal mission of
vengeance, complete with clubs,
a bat and broken beer bottles.

“It makes you more efficient.
It makes you more conscious of
spending, makes you look
through
textbook
catalogs
carefully. Makes you be a wise
buyer and a smart purchaser.”
At Nobel, lesson plans and
textbooks are chosen by a sixperson national advisory board
— five education experts and one
member of Nobel’s board of
directors. The curriculum is
discussed at the company’s
annual meeting, and stockholders
are invited to open houses at
Nobel schools about three times a
year.
“Sometimes I’ll hear from
individual stockholders who may
ask advice or suggest computer
programs to use in the
curriculum,” Presseisen said.
Few
for-profit
schools
consistently post a profit, said
Lois Gerber, chairwoman of the
120-member
National
Independent Private Schools
Association, which represents
only for-profit schools. She
estimated that on average,
NIPSA schools make a 7 percent
to 8 percent profit.
Nobel is the only publicly
traded NIPSA member. It
reported net losses in 1997 of
$844,577 on revenues of $81

million. The company took $2.45
million in extraordinary and
restructuring charges, citing the
closures of facilities in Maine and
Indiana.
Nobel stock dropped to $4.50
per share on the Nasdaq
exchange last fall, down from
more than $15 in early 1996. It
has since rebounded to about
$8.35 per share. An investment
group that includes Michael R.
Milken and Laurence J. Ellison,
chief executive of Oracle Corp.,
bought a 21.2 percent stake in
Nobel in January — leaving
analysts optimistic about Nobel’s
future.
“That is a very strong
indication of some faith in the
companies from a couple of
major investment groups,”
McLaughlin said. “They have
done very well and are strongly
on their way back.”
Nobel’s success or failure
could be the beginning of a major
change in the U.S. education.
“It’s part of this overall feeling
that public institutions are not
operating well enough, so you
bring in market principles to have
it operate better,” Jennings said.
“If they are successful, public
schools should emulate the forprofit schools. If they are not
successful, they should blow
away.”

will have the best teachers, most
up-to-date textbooks and highest
quality lessons. If stocks drop,
education could be compromised,
she said.
“Nobody knows if they can
provide a quality education,” said
Jack Jennings, director of the
Center on National Education
Policy in Washington. “Do they
have to shift costs in some way?
...Maybe there’s some things
where you can’t rely on market
principles.”
But advocates of for-profit
schools say education should run
like a business. If customers —
i.e. parents — are dissatisfied or
finances run amok, the business
should fold, they say.
“Every aspect of education ...
everything the schools need to
operate is done on a free-market
basis except for the actual
teaching of children
and
management of schools,” said
John McLaughlin, director of the
Education Industry Group, which
tracks 25 publicly traded
education companies, only a
handful of which run schools.
“That’s an accepted way of
doing business in every other
facet of our life and I don’t see
why it cannot play out in
education.”

court instead of on the practice
field, together accused of battery,
mob action and felony home
invasion in an attack on the
fraternity.
And with the possibility of
more charges hanging in the air,
the embarrassing and frightening
episode is far from over.
"People live in fear, and
people don’t like living in fear,”
said Joe Benarroch, a 19-year-old
sophomore and member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
Benarroch and about 40 other
SAE members were in the
fraternity’s basement for a
meeting on March 22 when
attackers burst in.
“There were people holding
bats, there was a guy holding a
club, just storming in,” he said.
“It was just chaos. Chairs were
being thrown around. People
were fleeing for their lives.”
Benarroch pointed to a narrow
hallway between the bare, dingy
basement and a bathroom. Two
members dragged themselves
down that hallway to escape the
fight, leaving behind a trail of
blood, he said.
His best friend, he said, lay at
the bottom of the stairs.
“I thought he had been
stabbed,” Benarroch said. “He
was just caked in blood.”

In the end, six fraternity
members were hospitalized for
injuries ranging from a mangled
hand to cuts and bruises. All were
released.
By the time police arrived,
many of the 20 or so attackers
had fled. But the three people
arrested had a common tie all
were members of the university’s
football team.
Police trace the Sunday attack
to a party at the fraternity house
the night before. According to
witnesses, a fight erupted after
fraternity members caught a
football player urinating in their
shower and tried to get him to
leave, said Normal Police Lt.
Tony Daniels.
Because no police report was
filed Saturday night, no one is
sure who instigated the fight.
Fraternity members insist they
were not to blame.
But the Sunday attack appears
to be retaliatory, Daniels said.
“Individuals identified as ISU
football players ... basically
began to wail on members of the
fraternity,” he said. “They had
quite a lot of football players
there.”
The university’s athletic
departmeni suspended the eight

players who have been charged
so far. They are: defensive
linemen Jason Leach, 20,
Leonard Reliford, 19, and Aaron
M. Hallead, 19; defensive back
Kenneth Ramsey, 22; linebacker
Christopher Marks, 18; running
back Mark A. Hosey Jr., 19; and
walk-ons Robert Boyd, 19, and
Aveion Cason, 18.
Two other players were
arrested but never charged.
The
players
have
not
responded publicly to the charges
and could not be reached by
telephone, either because their
numbers are not listed or they did
not answer.
But football coach Todd Berry
said at a news conference soon
after the attack that he thought
the reported number of players
involved was exaggerated. He
also said some players were
“beaten up” in Saturday’s fight at
the fraternity party.
“It’s right for everybody

involved to suffer the natural
consequences of doing something
wrong in both incidents,” Berry
said.
Athletic
director
Rick
Greenspan said he and Berry
have met with the team to sort out
what happened. They are relying
on the court system and
university disciplinary process to
help decide their next course of
action, he said.
“Our approach has been one
of disappointment, dismay,
remorse,” Greenspan said.
He called the incident an
embarrassment but noted that it
involves only a few players on
Illinois State’s 90-man roster.
The university has begun its
own student judicial review of
the attack, said ISU spokesman
Jay Groves. The off-campus
incident should not stir up
concerns about campus safety, he
added.
Prosecutors, meanwhile, are
sifting through more than 50
statements police took from
witnesses. Police continue to
look at five more suspects to

A l e s t l e

gauge their involvement, Daniels
said.
Still, because only one or two
fraternity members could identify
any alleged attackers, prosecutors
could have a tough time bringing
more charges, said Stephanie
Wong, an assistant McLean
County state’s attorney.
At the fraternity house, little
evidence remains of the attack. A
gaping hole in the basement
marks the place where the
fraternity’s letters used to be, and
a few window panes are broken.
But fraternity members still
remember the attack vividly.
SAE chapter president Rich
Salvador said the incident has
drawn the fraternity closer
together. But some members are
afraid to return to the house and
have indicated they will move out
next year, he said.
The rest hope for swift justice
as they try to put the incident
behind them, Benarroch said.
“You don’t necessarily heal,”
he said. “You don’t forget. You
just move on.”

Contactors claim feds ove them
$20 million for climatic lab work
EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE,
Fla.
(AP)
—
Sixteen
construction companies claim
the federal government owes
them $20 million more for extra
work performed during the
renovation of the Air Force’s
McKinley Climatic Laboratory.
The government already has
paid about $75 million for the
project that was completed last
June. The dispute has left several
subcontractors
on
shaky
financial ground, the Northwest
Florida Daily News of Fort
Walton Beach reported Saturday.
“We started the project with a
$1 million contingency fund,”
said Mike Singleton, president
of Colorado-based Singleton
Sheet Metal Works. “When we
pulled out of there, we were
broke.”
The laboratory is an insulated
and refrigerated hangar, big
enough to enclose a football
field, built 51 years ago on this

Florida Panhandle base. It is
used to test military and civilian
aircraft, vehicles and other
equipment
under
various
weather conditions including
temperatures ranging from 165
degrees to minus-165 degrees.
The renovation was supposed
to take two years but the lab was
found to be in worse condition
than expected after the work
began. Changes then were made
in the renovation plan that added
more than a year and additional
work to the project, but the
budget remained unchanged, the
contractors contend.
Tim Dugan, a spokesman in
the Army Corps of Engineers’
Mobile, Ala., district office, said
he could not comment on the
claims because they are in
litigation before the Armed
Services Board of Contract
Appeals.
The
Corps • of
Engineers handled the project.

Department of Health cites nursing home for neglience
EDWARDSVILLE, 111. (AP) — The Illinois
Department of Public Health has cited the Madison
County Nursing Home for negligence after an 85-year-old
man with a history of escape attempts fell to his death out
a third-floor window of the home in February.
The nursing home was cited in five violations of state
rules in the death of William Morton of Collinsville, who
fell from the window of his room, apparently while trying
to escape.
The Department of Public Health report noted that
Morton had tried to leave the home several times since
arriving Jan. 8 and had to be restrained by a soft belt four
days before his death after attempting to leave by a fire
door on the third floor and threatening to climb out a

window.
The state charged that the home failed to advise
Morton’s doctor that Morton had been restrained, was
negligent in their supervision of him and failed to develop
a plan to stop Morton from trying to leave.
But Roger Hotson, administrator of the nursing home,
said that consistently restraining Morton, locking his
window or administering drugs would have violated
f e d e r a l ______________________________________
and state
guidelines.
He said the
staff had
checked

Morton shortly before his death and found him sleeping.
The state’s allegations came just days before the
Madison County Board will be debating the future of
county nursing and sheltered-care homes. Last month,
voters rejected tax increases to build and operate a $6.5
million combined home.

Well, finally, something has
been released to help people
like me out. Olean-based snacks
have hit the shelves. Now, tubby
bastards like myself can enjoy
the great taste of snack chips
and not worry about eating the
entire bag.
The snacks, which have the
same great taste of the old fatty
kind, are missing half the
calories and most of the fat.
Of course, everything that’s
too good to be true, probably is.
Many people have heard
about the possible side-effects
of Olean, and the chips even
come with an information
(warning) label.
The chips may cause “loose
stool” and/or stomach cramping.
Loose stool, what a nice way of
referring to diarrhea. I don’t see
what the problem is. Not only
will the chips not add on the
pounds, they’ll make you lose
weight by sending you to the
bathroom for multiple and
lengthy visits.
Or else, the painful stomach
cramps will make you stop
eating. And, for the really obese
Olean dieter, the eventual cancer
that the chemicals probably will
give you will definitely help
drop off the pounds.
Soon you’ll be saying,
“MMmmm, that’s malignant!”
I’m so glad that those wacky
scientists at the Food and Drug
Administration have decided to
let the general public consume
some more chemicals. I certainly
can’t wait for Olean chocolate
and peanut butter.
The real fun will come when
they release “I Can’t Believe It’s
Not Deadly!” the fun chemical
that actually releases tapeworms
into the body to devour up those
calories. You can lose weight by
eating all you want, baby!

Wednesday will find much of the country
in a panic to get their important tax documents
into the mail. After the excitement, frazzled
Americans
can
relax
and watch mega-brained Ben Stein make
mincemeat of an auditor, a CPA and a
lawyer on his trivia game show, “Win Ben
Stein’s Money.”
The second season premiere episode will
air on April 15 on Comedy Central. The show
stars actor (“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”) and
former Nixon speechwriter, Stein as he takes
on three contestants who try to win $5,000 of
his money. In an effort to help those who are
struggling with their tax receipts, Stein offers
12 tax tips for the public:
Tip #1: Unless you have an extremely
complicated return, you don’t necessarily
need an expensive CPA to do your tax returns.
Try a computer tax preparation program like
“Turbo Tax.” To relax, try “Duke Nukem” and
“Cyber Sluts.”
Tip #2: Remember to keep all your business
records in case you ever get audited. Keep all
your Yanni records in case you ever get a
lobotomy.

Tip #3: Report anything that can conceivably
be considered a deduction. For example, if
you’re an exotic dancer, breast implants are
considered a business expense. However, if
you’re having a business meeting at a topless
bar, you can’t write off your underpants.
Tip #4: Remember to deduct last year’s tax
preparation help. Forget about deducting the
cost of professional help you received from
your personal psychic friend, Vladamir.
Tip #5: Don’t take a home office deduction
unless absolutely necessary. It’s like waving a
red flag at the IRS. Incidentally, writing off
your car is like stuffing a blue handkerchief in
your left pocket. Not that there’s anything
wrong with that.
Tip #6: Whenever possible, take payment in
barter so you don’t have income tax
consequences, i.e. “I’ll prepare your will if
you paint my house.” When dealing with me,
however, please keep in mind that I have a
very big house.
Tip #7: Jointly own all property with your
spouse so that it escapes any tax consequence
at death. I know death is a less than cheerful
subject, but the bright side is that as far as we
know, there are no taxes in the afterlife.
Tip #8: If you have the misfortune to be
audited, remember- that the IRS agent is just a
man or woman like you or me and not a

satanic figure. He/she just wants to get home
at the end of the day like you, except you don’t
live in hell.
Tip #9: The absolute best tax deal is to have
as much of your income as possible as capital
gains that are unrealized and then pass the
property on to your heirs tax free, except for
the estate tax. If you understand this piece of
advice you should be working for the IRS.
Tip #10: Never let anyone sell you anything
on the sole basis that it’s tax deductible, you
can’t make money on a tax deduction. Also,
never let anyone sell you anything that
guarantees it will stop the itching and burning.
It will only make you walk funny.
Tip #11: As terrible as you feel when you're
doing your taxes, that’s how good you feel
when you put them in the mail. Unless you
owe money, in which case, who am I kidding?
It sucks.
Tip #12: If you are one of the lucky ones to
get a tax return, take most of the money and
pay off credit card debts. Paying off credit
card debts will save you hundreds of dollars
this year in interest payments, and free up
additional cash each month. If that doesn’t
sound good, party like it’s 1999. You’ll be able
to write it off on your return in the year 2000.

After a clever ruse on April Fool’s Day, the real truth about who is
Cartman’s father will be revealed on April 22.
Comedy Central will move up the date of the new episode of
“South Park” due to popular demand. It was originally planned to air
with the new season’s episodes that begins on May 20.
The show used a clever holiday tie-in earlier this month, by
claiming that the rotund character’s dad would be unmasked on April
1. But, instead, the episode shown was a 30-minute mini-movie about
two other “South Park” characters, Terrence and Phillip.
The real episode’s plot involves Mephesto being shot and Chef and
the quartet of schoolboys travelling to hell to find out the truth.

Winning streak over weekend puts Cougar softball No. 1 in GLVC
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
Winning 14 of their last 15
games made the SIUE softball
team the overwhelming choice for
the No. 1 seed in the Great Lakes
Valley Conference tournament
next weekend.
SIUE made their claim as the
best team in the conference by
going 5-1 last weekend. Two of
the wins were over the team that
finished last season ranked No. 2
in the country, the University of
Wisconsin-Parkside.
Sophomore
pitcher
Sara
Obrecht improved her record to 41 in a 5-3 SIUE win over St.
Joseph’s College. Freshman
Mandy Uhrhan went 2 for 4 with
a home run and two RBIs. Kim
Messinger, of Bridgeton, Mo.,
added two hits and an RBI, while
catcher Kari Franzen had two hits
and a couple of stolen bases.
Mental mistakes proved to be
the deciding factor against an
offensive
minded
Lewis
University team on Friday.
With a tie game going into the
fifth inning, SIUE self-destructed
with sloppy fielding in the last
three innings to allow Lewis to
pull away for a 9-1 victory.

The Cougar baseball team
showed signs of improve­
ment defensively
Saturday
against conference foe St.
Joseph’s College.
Head coach Gary Collins said
the defense was not quite where
he would like it to be. The
players answered his statement
by playing errorless baseball and
splitting a pair of games in the
doubleheader.
In the first game, senior
pitcher Bob LaMarsh put on a
show with his bat and his
throwing arm. At the plate, he
went 4 for 4 with two homers
and four RBIs. He also hurled a
complete game, striking out
seven while walking just one.
The Cougars won the game 11-3.
“He’s a real player,” Collins
said. “He had a big game. When
he pitches well, he plays well.”
The Cougars put St. Joseph’s
in a hole early. They came out
firing their huge bats right
off the start, scoring five runs
in the first inning and three in
the second.
“This is a big inning
team,” Collins said. “We
either get ‘em early, in the

middle, or in the end.”
SIUE
shortstop
Mike
Robertson contributed with three
hits, and Jason Sievert blasted
his fourth home run of the
season en route to victory.
In the second game, run
production was more difficult
for the Cougars. St. Joseph’s
hurler Jake Zajc shut out the
baffled Cougars for eight
innings, beating the Cougars 6-4.
“He pitched well, just like he
does against everyone else,”
Collins said. “We just ran into a
really good pitcher.”
Despite trailing 6-0 going into
the ninth inning, SIUE was
relentless in losing without a
fight. They knocked out Zajc,
but Mike Field came on to stop
the bleeding for St. Joseph’s.
“There was a bad call at first
(base) that just about everyone
disagreed with but the umpire,”
Collins said. “It cost us an out
and a run. Sometimes you get the
call, sometimes you don’t.”
SIUE right fielder Jason
Abernathy had three hits,
and Robertson hit his teamleading tenth home run in the
losing effort.

Sports Column: Finley analyzes the home run king of the Cardinals

Mark McGwire.
A man that can knock the
hide off the ball with the ease
that the rest of the world uses to
open a door.
The same man who seemed to
let the entire Cardinal family down
this past Sunday when he struck out.
I was sitting at the dinner table
eating Easter dinner with my family

and friends and my friend made a
comment that almost seemed
impossible.
“I betcha McGwire strikes out.
Do you think that your family
would hate me if I said that
out loud?”
Needless to say, I warned him
against making that slanderous
statement about my team.
Die-hard Cardinal fan I am
not, but a true lover of a good
game, I am.
Not a moment after he said that,

Orel Hershiser sent a whizzing
fastball right down McGwire’s
middle section sending him back to
the dugout with a smirk of disgust
on his face.
Not only did my jaw drop,
but every last -one of those
Big Mac-loving fans lost the
elasticity in their jaws.
My heart sank. Sad, but true,
I felt bad for Ole Mark. He
seemed to want to smack that ball
into another time zone so bad that
the disgust in his face seemed

In the men’s high jump,
lone finisher Ernie

In the men’s long jump, Joshua

My goodness, the home run king
had just struck out.
How Casey At The Bat can
you get?
The next thing I heard in my ear
was another slanderous comment
from the peanut gallery.
‘Told you so. McGwire isn’t
all he’s cracked up to be,” my
friend said.

Sure the Great Bambino
smacked 715 home runs, but he also
struck out somewhere in the ball
park of 1,000 times — give or take
a few hundred.
Even though it was just one
time, in one game, that final whiff
of the bat through the air made
it evident, even though we all
love Mark McGwire, the man is
not immortal.
He will make mistakes, be it
at bat or at first base, but that

Just watch next time. His bat will
be so hungry for hide, I just pity the

They know what he is capable
of and so do the thousands of
