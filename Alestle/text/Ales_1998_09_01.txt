C. Everett Koop to open

Campus Religious Center offers
activities, cheap soda for the soul
BY DANA MILES
NEWS STRINGER
College life has its ups and
downs. Friends are not always
around. Cash may run a little
low, but where there is doubt,
there is hope.
This hope can be found at
SIUE’s Religious Center,
where the language is the Lord
and the soda is cheap.
The Religious Center is
the home for three of the

campus ministries: The United
Campus
Ministries,
the
Catholic Campus Ministry and
Peck Christian Fellowship.
The
United
Campus
Ministry is a shared ministry of
the Christian Church (Disciples
of Christ), Church of the
Brethren, Presbyterian Church
(USA), United Church of
Christ
and
the
United
Methodist Church.
This ministry offers Bible
studies and social service

activities.
Some of the
programs are an alternative fall
break opportunity and a
science-fiction movie night
once a month.
Counseling for spiritual
direction and other questions is
also available. A Bible study
group
meets
6
p.m.
Wednesdays
followed by
supper. All students are
welcome.
See CENTER, page 2

The 14th annual season of
SIUE’s Arts and Issues series
begins at 7:30 p.m. Saturday,
Sept. 12, with former U.S.
Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop speaking in the Meridian
Ballroom on a variety of healthrelated topics.
Koop, a pre-eminent figure
in public health, served as U.S.
surgeon general from 1981 to
1989. He is an internationally
recognized pediatric surgeon and
has written more than 200
articles and books on the practice
of medicine and surgery,
biomedical ethics, and health
policy.
“This will be Dr. Koop’s
first and only appearance at
SIUE,” said Richard Walker,
coordinator of the Arts and Issues
series. “The Arts and Issues
series is kind of like a living
library, except you can only
check the book out once. I’ve
been doing this program for 12
years, and I’ve never repeated a
speaker. Dr. Koop is a very busy
man. He is genuinely concerned
about the health of the American
people. He is very passionate and
this is a calling for him. It is an
honor and a privilege for us to
have a man of his stature.”
Koop will speak for roughly

45 minutes, Walker said, on a
variety of health-related issues
including
smoking,
environmental health hazards,
diet and nutrition, immunization
and AIDS. The former surgeon
general will then open the floor
for a 30-minute question and
answer session.
“Dr. Koop has agreed that no
topic is off-limits,” Walker said.
“I think what he is doing is very
brave and admirable.”
A
1937
graduate
of
Dartmouth
College,
Koop
received his medical degree from
Cornell Medical College in 1941.
After serving an internship
at the Pennsylvania Hospital, he
pursued postgraduate training at
the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine, the Boston
Children’s Hospital, and the
Graduate School of Medicine at
the University of Pennsylvania,
where he received the degree of
Doctor of Science (Medicine) in
1947.
Koop currently serves as
Senior Scholar at the C. Everett
Koop Institue at Dartmouth.
Perhaps best known for his
efforts at exposing the tobacco
industry in the early ‘80s, Koop
also became the government’s
chief spokesman about AIDS.

FIC helps students bond with peers with like interests and majors
BY ALICIA MIDDENDORF
NEWS STRINGER
There are more than 2,300
students living in University
Housing complexes, and many of
them are finding new friends
through
focused
interest
communities.
These communities, or FICs,
are a new program offered in
Woodland Hall and there are ones
under development in Prairie
Hall. The program places

students into communities based
upon academic and social
interests. Students are assigned to
rooms according to these
interests and live with likeminded students.
The designated communities
are nursing, engineering, scholar,
international • experience and
language, business, emerging
leaders and healthy lifestyles or
wellness.
The main purpose of any
FIC is to give students a true

sense of their interest areas, offer
programs associated with that
interest and establish easy access
to faculty and staff members
working in that area.
Resident Assistant Sherri
McWhirter works with the
international experience and
language
community
in
Woodland Hall. M cW hirter’s
main goal is to understand why
her
residents
chose
this
community and to find activities
to help the residents fully benefit

from
their
new-found
relationships and experiences.
After surveying the residents,
McWhirter observed that the
students are interested in
culturally focused activities such
as trips to art museums.
McWhirter said that FICs help
“build communities inside the
residence hall by bringing people
with like interests together.”
As well, McWhirter said, the
main focus of the international
experience
and
language

community is to teach its
members that “cultural diversity
is a good thing and that everyone
smiles in the same language.”
Lisa McKirgan, marketing
coordinator
of
University
Housing, said there are many
reasons why students choose to
be part of an FIC. “Some students
just want to live near people who
have the same interests and
others want to deeply experience
their major,” she said.

“Dr. Koop caught my
interest several years ago,”
Walker said. “I’ve always been
interested in what was going on

was very interested in bringing

we’ve continued to pursue it for

communities also help students
choose classes, majors and
careers.
Jennifer Busse, a Woodland
Hall resident, said she has made
promising relationships with her
new roommates.
In all, McKirgan said, the
main goal of focused interest
communities is to “really help
students.”

Kara Struston, a^istant
director of Resident Life,
commented that the FIC program
helps students feel
more
connected with the institution
and enables students to take part
in experiences that will impact
their academic interests. Struston
said she hopes that the program
will grow and improve benefits
for all housing students.

the past several years. Students in
Health are already studying the
work of Dr. Koop. Now, I’m
going to bring him on campus so
they can meet the man
personally. It's really a way of
bringing the textbooks to life.
Instead of reading about the
people making history in history
books, you can meet them in
person.”
Tickets for the 1998-99

season of Arts and Issues are now
available.
The season subscription for
the seven-program series is $66;
students pay $33. Tickets to Dr.
Koop’s appearance are $6;
students, $3.
Free parking behind Morris
University Center in the visitors
lot is provided with the purchase
of a ticket. For more information,

The
Catholic
ministry
focuses on three areas: worship
and faith formation, the Peace
and Justice Ministry and
community life. Members gather
in fellowship after each Sunday
liturgy for
refreshments.
Throughout the school year, they
organize community picnics,
outings, road trips, a caving trip,
movie
nights,
midnight
breakfasts and more.
Another
Catholic
organization is the Newman
Student Union. All students are
welcome to join.
Peck Christian Fellowship
works to help students focus on
Jesus
Christ
along
with
schoolwork. Student leaders are
trained within the group to keep
the ministry afloat. Bryan
Manary is a full-time pastor and
teacher who leads Tuesday Bible
study and Sunday worship
service.
Peck Christian Fellowship
has Bible study at 7 p.m.
Tuesdays. At 8 a.m. Thursdays,
there is a prayer service
and a Sunday church service at
5:30 p.m.
Along with the Religious
Center’s organizations, there are
many other spiritually oriented
organizations on campus.
The UN-Church encourages
students to come as they are for a
non-traditional service. At 7 a.m.
Tuesday, Sept. 16, UN-Church
will be sponsoring an event
called “See You at the Pole.”
The purpose is to pray for
the schools and people of this
nation. The event will take place
at the flagpole in the center of the
Hairpin.
After prayer, there will be a
breakfast fellowship in the
Cahokia Room of the University
Center.

The freshest meat in town
My sister, Deidre, started high school when I was
getting ready to graduate. Being that I was three years
wiser than her I gave her a list of all the boys she
shouldn’t associate with. Now I know someone out
there is groaning, but she needed to know that not
everyone is looking out for her personal best interest.
Danielle
The least 1 could do as her sister was to warn her of the
Belton
vultures that were about to prey upon her as soon as she
entered the building. If she still wanted to associate with those
people after my warning that was her business. But if she got stabbed
in the back, she couldn’t say 1 didn’t warn her.
Once again, I will be three years wiser as my sister completes
her last year of high school and she’s going to be waiting on that list
for college. After all, there are somethings that our mother will forget
to tell her because it's been awhile since mom was where 1 am now.
College always starts off fascinating, but as the first two weeks
pass, the reality of a student’s limitless freedom and limitless
problems set in. Why be stingy with my three years of wisdom and
only enlighten my sister? As much as I’d like to name names as I
did for my sister. I could get sued for that. So we’ll have to settle on
some sisterly advice to all the female freshmen who are embarking
on the psychological adventure of their life.
#1: “The Hall Lush.” Of course you have to be 21 to drink
alcohol, but some people have been drinking since high school.
Liquor in some cases is almost synonymous with campus life. But
you don’t want to become the “Woodland Hall Lush.’’ I lived across
the hall from the Hall Lush; it wasn’t pretty. At 3 a.m. she would
stand in the hallway screaming and crying at the top of her lungs.
The next day she would cry more, then she’d get happy and go to a
party, then come home ... well, she was a stinking drunken mess’.
Needless to say, she didn’t return for her sophomore year.
#2: “Fresh Meat.” It’s like how it was your freshman year in
high school, only worse. Some men will say and do anything if it
means you’ll have sex with them. I’m not saying don’t have sex, but
see how long they’ll stay around. If they lose interest quickly, I think
they wanted sex. And don’t fret, in college there are many men to
choose from. Of course, the question will always be do you want
them.
#3: “It Came From the Net.” Meeting people over the Net is
fine, letting them come spend the weekend with you isn’t. You’re
probably thinking, well duh. Better judgment can just disappear
when you’re lonely and you realize that half the guys you were
interested in only wanted to sleep with you. Although some guys on
the net seem nice, it’s better just to leave well enough alone.
#4: “Party All the Time.” You might not notice it now, but all the
parties are the same. White or black, Greek or a club, they are all the
same and after a while, you won’t be able to distinguish one from
another. I got burnt out on Cougar Den parties thrown by local Greek
organizations quickly. Although a fun release, indulging in one too
many can lead to problems. If you miss a party because you really
need to study, don't feel bad, there will be another party next
weekend just like it. I promise you.
Last, but not least, don’t be afraid to get out there and participate
on campus as well as within your own social circles. In this world
you’re either a spectator or a participator. Spectators always sit
around and wish they’d tried something, a participator gets out there
and succeeds and fails and feels better for it.
Hopefully that advice will last Deidre through November,
before she forgets all I’ve taught her.

L etters to the E d ito r
Student Government
“Student Government is for
everyone.” That is what they say,
but how do you know? Well,
before I became public relations
chair, I did not really understand
how
Student
Government
worked. I thought it seemed
boring and could not be for
someone like me. You see, I am
an art education major and I am
interested in the creative side of
things! I did not think that
Student Government would be
the place to use creative skills. I
thought everyone in Student
Government had the same job,
when, in actuality, there are many
positions available.
The Finance Board chair
oversees the distribution of funds
to student organizations. The
Personnel Board chair interviews
students in order to fill positions
on university-wide committees.
The Public Relation Board chair
is responsible for promoting a
positive image of Student
Government.
The
Student
Organization Advisory Board
chair
reviews
student
organizations’ constitutions and
coordinates the annual space
allocation process in the Kimmel
Leadership Center.
The president of the student
body is the person who has the
main say as to what happens in
Student Government. He can
veto certain items which would
not be beneficial to the
university. The vice president is
responsible for chairing Student
Senate meetings and assumes the
president’s duties in the event
that he is unavailable. The
student trustee serves as the
SIUE student representative to
the SIU Board of Trustees. There

is also the option of becoming a
student senator. The Senate
members are responsible for
furthering the interests of
students and encouraging the
student body to become more
active.
As you can see, once I got
involved in Student Government,
I realized how wrong I was! My
position as Public Relations
Board chair allows me to use my
creative skills in promoting
Student Government while
communicating face to face with
students about issues that affect
them.
I am surprised at how much
my input and opinions determine
what actually happens on
campus. I am glad I decided to
join rather than to just sit back
and let other people make
decisions that affect me as a
student. Why not get involved in
Student Government today?
There are over 30 universitywide committees to meet your
skills and interests! Stop by our
office on the first floor in the
Morris University Center and
you too will be surprised at what
a great experience it is!

Public Relations Board Chair

McGwire and Andro
Nobody
wishes
Mark
McGwire ill. Many Americans,
young and old, look to St. Louis
for a modern-day hero.
It is precisely for these
reasons that McGwire’s use of
androstenedione raises questions
that shouldn’t be swept under the
rug. The substance could
eventually hurt McGwire’s health

and it sends a terrible message to
the young people who look up to
him.
Androstenedione
is
a
relatively weak androgen, which
means it increases the male sex
hormone and helps build muscle.
Some
doctors
call
androstenedione
a
steroid,
though the classification is
debated.
Dr. Harvey Simon, a
Harvard medical professor and
expert on sports medicine, says
he hasn’t seen studies on
androstenedione,
but
that
androgens that have been studied
have a similar risk profile - liver
disease, acne, low sperm counts
and possible heart disease
resulting from an increase in bad
cholesterol.
Unfortunately,
legal
products sold over-the-counter
aren’t always safe or effective.
That’s because Congress decided
in 1994 that the Food and Drug
Administration would no longer
regulate dietary supplements.
It’s understandable that
Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa
and some players have reacted
angrily to press reports about the
substance.
But LaRussa is going way
too far in talking about banning
The Associated Press from the
locker room because an AP
reporter broke the story.
No one suggests that
McGwire needs Andro to hit
home runs ... so why doesn’t
McGwire just toss the pills in the
locker room wastebasket?
And next year, Major
League Baseball should take
McGwife and all the other
sluggers off the hot spot and “Just
Say No.”

Fourth annual Rocky Hprror
Picture Show rocks campu»*
■ BY TRAVIS NUCKOLLS
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
Most everyone knows the
cult classic “The Rocky Horror
Picture Show” and the loony
antics that accompany the movie.
The film was back on
campus for its fifth annual
showing as part of Welcome
Week. And, just to be sure that
every one had a chance to join in
the craziness, props were passed
out among the 70 or so audience
members Thursday night as they
gathered for the showing on the
patio outside the Bookstore in the
Morris University Center. The
show was sponsored by the
University Center Board.
Students passed out
plastic bags with squirt guns,
popcorn, a newspaper (The
Alestle, naturally) and a
sheet
of
paper
with
information about the movie,
how to use the props and
instructions on how to do the
“Time Warp" dance. Rolls of
toilet
paper,
another
necessary
element
to
enhance viewing enjoyment
of the film, came separately.
The 1975 film contains
an all-star cast including Tim
Curry
as
a
“Sweet
Transvestite
from
Transsexual, Transylvania.”
The movie also stars Susan
Sarandon performing less
than brilliantly as the naive
Janet. Barry Bostwick and
Meatloaf round out the cast.

The movie had been
scheduled for 7:30 p.m., but it
wasn’t dark enough to start the
outdoor film. Shortly before 8,
the crowd grew restless and
began to chant “We want Lips!
We want Lips.” The movie opens
with an extreme closeup of a pair
of lips singing a homage to the
science-fiction films of the ‘50s.
Some of the spectators came
fully prepared, dressed in high
heels, fish-net stockings and
mime-painted
faces.
Most,
however, were in street clothes.
Just before 8, as the sun

Photos by M ike Pernicka/Afesi/e

sank, everyone began to chant in
anticipation. When the opening
credits illuminated the screen, a
cheer came from the crowd and a
few rolls of toilet paper sailed
into the air.
The story of “The Rocky
Horror Picture Show” follows a
young couple seeking shelter
from a storm after their car
breaks down. Crowd members
used the squirt guns to simulate
the rain and then, just like the
young couple, used newspaper to
cover their heads.
The two, played by Bostwick

and Sarandon, find shelter in the
castle of the deranged, alien
transvestite Dr. Frank N. Furter.
From this point, the movie is a
roller-coaster ride of weird
characters, strong sexual content
and bizarre songs, dances and
situations.
As audiences have done
throughout the world for more
than two decades, SIUE students
got into the swing of things,
cheering and booing on-screen
characters, repeating lines and, of
course, dancing and singing such
hits as “Let’s Do the Time Warp

Again” (“It’s just a jump to the
left ... It nearly drives you
insane.”)
One student brought his
books with him and even
attempted to look at them as the
movie played. But, he’d put them
aside every time a dance number
took place or there was an
opportunity to join in the fun.
Students had plenty of
remarks for the characters on the
screen. Most of those cannot be
printed here, but all of them were
funny. Sarandon’s Janet Weiss,
for example, is known as “Slut”
while Bostwick’s character,
the earnest Brad Majors, is
fondly known to Rocky
fans as a name that can't be
repeated in this paper
The finale of the movie
has the main characters in
black-lace corsets, high
heels and fish-net stockings
with their faces painted
white as mimes do. A
number of students were
made up that way and led
the audience in the final
production number.
“The Rocky Horror
Picture Show” is fun for all,
even if one has no idea what
is going on. The bottom line
is that bad acting, catchy
songs and a bizarre plot
make for one heck of a
good time.

The SIU E w om en’s volleyball team
began their season with a bang by going
undefeated at the C ougar Invitational.
The round-robin tournam ent took
place at the V adalabene C enter on Friday
and Saturday. O ther schools participating
in the to u rn am e n t included D fury
College, University of Missouri-St. Louis,
U niversity
of
South
C arolinaSpartanburg, and H illsdale College
(Michigan).

O n Friday, the Cougars defeated D rury
in three straight games and seem ed to play
better each game. SIU E won 15-12, 15-8,
and 15-3.
The m ost significant im provem ent in
the three games may have been the team ’s
attack percentage. In game one, the
Cougars had a percentage of just .071.
Their percentage in game three was an
impressive 40 percent.
O n Saturday, the C ougars only
challenge
was
South
C arolinaSpartanburg who took one of the four
games. S IU E ’s loss in the second game

was their only defeat in the tournam ent.
The Cougars won 15-6, 5-15,15-12, and
15-3. Michelle Gilm an led SIU E with 17
kills, and Lindsay R u st provided the
defense with 22 digs.
Rust and Gilm an were each nam ed to
the All-Tournam ent Team. Rust compiled
36 defensive digs in the tournam ent, and
Gilman smashed 39 kills.
S IU E ’s first opponent on Saturday was
Hillsdale. The Cougars showed no signs of
weakness by sweeping three games in a
row.
The Cougars finished with a 3-0 record.

M en’s soccer ready to start playing for real
BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS W R ITER
With all of the exhibition games behind them , the season
opener comes this weekend, and the SIU E m en’s soccer team is
jum ping right into heavy com petition.
A couple of games against top ranked regional team s in the
SIU E tournam ent will kick off the regular season for the
Cougars.
SIU E will be looking at a m irror image of them selves in terms
of playing style when they take on G annon U niversity Saturday
night.
“This will be an interesting game to watch,” head coach Ed
H uneke said. “G annon has the same game style as we do. They
specialize at working the ball and have a good com bination of
plays.”
Last year, SIU E downed M ercyhurst College in a late season
battle that had significance for the Cougars’ post season fate. This
year, the game may fall in the first w eekend of the schedule, but
the im portance o f a victory is still there.

“M ercyhurst comes at you with a hard style to play against,”
H uneke said. “They play very physical and intense.”
SIU E surprised a lot of critics when the team gave St. Louis
University all it could handle in a 1-0 overtim e loss in the Bronze
B oot G am e last week. The Cougars continued to play well in a 22 tie with the SIU E Alumni squad on Sunday evening.
“We had good intense play,” H uneke said about the battle
with Division I powerhouse, SLU. “O ur effort was better than I
had anticipated. For the majority of the gam e we were right with
them .”
Against the Alum ni team, senior Todd H u n ter found the net,
and freshm an Justin H uneke came off the bench to score his
second goal of the exhibition season.
H uneke has been impressed with the way his young players
have been improving in the pre-season.
“The young players have responded-well against some tough
com petition in the pre-season,” H uneke said.
The sjeason o p en er against G annon and gam e against
M ercyhurst on Sunday both start at 7 p.m. at B ob G uelker Field.
