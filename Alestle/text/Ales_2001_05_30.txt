Cougars split first two series games
Alestle Staff Report

B r i a n W a i ,i .h e i m e r M l e s t l e

Senior second baseman Mark Bugger launches a home run into center field Monday in S lU E ’s 7-3 loss to North Florida. The Cougars
hit eight homers while splitting their tw o games over the weekend.

ROTC cadet takes home top honor
Kavitha Kareti
N e w s S t r in g e r

An SIUE ROTC cadet is the
best in the nation.
More than 100 Army ROTC
cadets from various colleges
participated in the National
Ranger Buddy Com petition at
Kansas University in Lawrence
last month but only one came out
on top.
S IU E ’s Jeffery Johnson

scored highest on the physical
fitness test for men. Johnson beat
93 competitors. He finished 117
push-ups, 96 sit-ups and ran 2
miles in 10 minutes 47 seconds.
He also served as the team
captain and trainer for SIUE.
The competition is an annual
physical fitness event that
challenges cadets both mentally
and physically.
SIUE has fielded teams the
past two years. This year, SIUE

sent 10 cadets, a total of five
teams, to the competition.
“We are proud of our teams.
This is also the first year SIUE
fielded female teams to compete.
All of our students worked hard
to be here and demonstrated both
Courage and determination,” Maj.

Greg Bak, an SIUE ROTC
instructor, said.
“Jeff showed an outstanding
performance. He led by example,
hard work and effort. He almost
ran the team by himself. Jeff was
clearly the right man for the job
and I am very proud,” Bak said.

An upset victory guarantees
the SIUE baseball Cougars a spot
among the six best in the nation.
Eight
team s
went
to
Montgomery, Ala., to do battle
Saturday and two teams went
home by Tuesday. SIUE defeated
the No. 1 nationally ranked
University of Tampa Spartans in
the first game of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
Division
II
World
Series
Saturday. Tampa was favored to
win the game and the tournament,
but the Cougars blasted five home
runs to take the win 9 -4 .
Tampa played the Delta State
U niversity
Statesm en
of
Cleveland in an elimination game
Monday. The Spartans had a onerun lead going into the top of the
ninth inning, but D elta State
loaded the bases and a Statesman
lined a shot over the left fielder’s
head to clear the bases and take
the win. Tampa, favored to
become the national champion,
was the first team to get on the
bus and head for home.
A lthough the Cougars hit
three home runs Monday in their
second
gam e
against
the
U niversity o f North Florida
Ospreys, they could not pull out
the win. The Cougars were
pushed into the losers bracket
when the Ospreys outscored them
7-3.

Geese protect their young

Board gets a deal
Alestle Staff Report
The SIU board of trustees
approved the purchase of the
building at 200 University Park
Drive for $1.4 million.
The
tw o-story
building
houses seven tenants who will
remain at the facility, including
SIU E ’s
International
Trade
Center,
Small
Business
Developm ent Center and the
Concrete Construction Resource
Unit.
Only half of the building’s
40,000 square feet is used. SIUE
plans to use 7,000 square feet for
a new Textbook Rental Center,
which is in the basem ent of
Lovejoy Library.
“This is an opportunity for
SIUE to gain much-needed space

at a favorable cost,” Chancellor
D avid
W erner
said.
“The
acquisition o f this building
eliminates the need to build a new
textbook rental facility. We also
gain some flexibility to create
classroom, office or other student
service space.”
The 11-year-old building
was owned by RTR Joint Venture
Partnership.
University spokesman Scott
Kaiser said the building is valued
at $3 million, so the $1.4 million
the school paid is a bargain.
“We think we got a good
deal on it,” Kaiser said.
The money for the newly
acquired building will come from
SIU E ’s operating cash, cash
reserves
and
profits
from
Textbook Rental.

Some o f S IU E’s resident Canada geese have hatched their goslings and are vehemently
protecting them. “Geese are basically nasty and will protect their young, ” biology department
chair Richard Brugam said. “You don’t want to threaten them in any way because they will b ite.”
Brugam added that the geese don’t present any real danger to adults. He also noted that the
Canada geese are a protected species and harming them can be illegal.

I attended the first few games o f the
National Collegiate Athletic Association
Division II World Series in Montgomery,
Ala., over the weekend to cheer for our
Cougars. It is an experience I will never
forget.
SIUE is playing for a national baseball
title. Only eight teams in the country were
still playing as o f Saturday. Now only six
remain. More than 200 have finished their
seasons, including the No. I team in the nation, the University of
Tampa Spartans. I had the opportunity to see our school help send
them home.
I rode more than 1,300 miles in a car over the weekend to see two
baseball games. It sounds a little crazy, doesn’t it? Maybe so, but I
wouldn’t trade that experience for anything in the world. Well, maybe
a new car, but we have to be realistic here.
Those two games were the biggest baseball games this school
has seen in four years when SIUE took fifth place in the nation in
1997. With the Cougar win Saturday, we are guaranteed at least sixth
place. Imagine that. O f more than 200 teams, we will be in at least the
top six, maybe higher depending on the results of Wednesday’s game.
I am tired and unwilling to go near cars after being stuck in one
for more than 13 hours, but I was able to watch the top eight teams in
the country battle it out to see who is the best, and it was worth every
minute. I would have stayed for the rest of the tournament but I have
classes, and you wouldn’t be reading this had I stayed longer.
A lot of people don't realize how great our teams really are. Look
at the last semester. The baseball team is in the national finals and the
softball team took second place in the region. We have six AllAmericans and several All-Region and All-Conference players in
those two sports.

Attention department heads, program
directors, student leaders ana
advisors:
The Alestle staff is already at work
preparing the Back to School Survival Guide.
We'd like to hear from you.
If
your
group,
department
or
organization wants to let Alestle readers
know about its activities and offerings,
write us.
The Alestle will accept articles up to 500
words for publication in the blockbuster
Back to School Survival Guide. This is free
space in the giude that is offered to groups
in good standing on a -firstcomefirstserved basis.
Articles must be received by July 20.
They may be sent in an email as a text only
document to alest1e_editor@hotmail.com.
Groups are also welcome to drop off a disk
(Mac or PC formatted) at the Alestle office
room 2022 of the Morris University Center.

Maybe I am just too full o f school spirit, but I can’t understand
why people aren’t fired up about these things. I understand that we
are a commuter school, but do people really live so far away that they
can’t attend a game or two every year? I don’t think so.
I don’t expect people to go to Montgomery to see the World
Series, but heading down to Roy Lee Field a few times w ouldn't hurt
anyone. In fact, it might just help the team.
I can’t say that I have been the best fan in all sports. 1 haven’t
seen a lot of the teams play yet, but I plan to go to as many games and
events as possible next year. It’s part o f the college experience. I don’t
want to look back 20 years from now and wish that I had gone to a
basketball or softball game. I want to look back and remember all the
good times I had, whether they were in the Vadalabene Center or in
Montgomery.
I hear people complain about SIUE not having a football team.
Well, get used to it. The way I see it, we don’t deserve one. W ho’s to
say that anyone would show up at the games? Everyone I have talked
to who is for a team says that people would show up for football.
They say games would sell out, that the school would go crazy over
the new sport. I don’t buy it. Show me a few hundred more people at
a volleyball game and I might change my mind.
It’s hard to muster more than 200 people at the sports we already
have. I completely understand the university not wanting to spend
millions on another sport that w on’t be supported.
We have nine different sports to enjoy. That adds up to hundreds
of opportunities to make an event. I promise, it won’t hurt.
So, go out and see a game or two, but watch out. You might have
fun.

ice as much energy per person than citizens in the
lited Kingdom. Many environmental groups feel the
ce of gasoline at the pump should include the cost of
aning up the toxic mess it makes for future
derations.
There are a variety of options for students who
pe to lower their gas consumption, whether it is for
ancial or environm ental reasons. Students
nsidering the purchase of a new vehicle may want to
nsider hybrid vehicles. Hybrid vehicles use a
mbination of gas and electricity, and due to the use of
;hly efficient technology, hybrid vehicles have
:remely low emissions and get fantastic gas mileage,
e Honda Insight is a hybrid vehicle already on the
irket, which gets 70 miles per gallon. This summer,
yota will introduce the Prius, a hybrid vehicle which
;rages 55 miles per gallon.
Another possibility for students who cannot afford
buy a new car is public transportation. Students who
e on campus or in the Edwardsville area will find
idison County Transit to be an inexpensive way to
t to campus. For 50 cents, students who live in
wardsville can catch a shuttle which will deposit
:m in front of the Peck Building. Schedules and route
ips for Madison County Transit are available in the
ormation Center, which is located in M orris
irversity Center. Schedules can also be found on the
lttles themselves.
Students looking for an excuse to get more exercise
juld consider riding a bike to campus. It is amazing
w fast you can get in shape when your exercise
Jtine is also your form of transportation. Cycling is
.•client exercise for the cardiovascular system, and
dents will find many benefits to their health and
jrgy levels while saving their budgets from higher
s prices.
Some students, like Raquel Ozanich, save "money
driving smaller cars. “ I drive a little rice burner, so it
ly costs me a few dollars more to fill my tank. I
mid encourage other students to consider smaller.
>re fuel efficient cars." Ozanich said.
Gas prices are expected to rise during the summer,
t with a few relatively simple lifestyle adjustments,
idents can avoid the worst of the costs.

Home runs helped the
Cougars to victory in the first
round of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Division II
World Series in Montgomery,
Ala., but could not get them a
win in the second round.
SIUE knocked off the No. 1
nationally ranked University of
Tampa Spartans 9-4 Saturday in
the opening game of the series.
The Cougars started out the
game with a first-pitch single by
freshman third baseman Luke
Humphrey. Junior shortstop
Chad Opel then launched a home
run to put SIUE up by two.
In the second inning, senior

left fielder Steve Berra and
sophomore center fielder Nick
Seibert hit back-to-back home
runs to give the Cougars a fourrun advantage.
In the bottom of the second
inning, ju n io r pitcher Dave
Crouthers got into trouble but
w orked his way out o f it.
Crouthers walked three in the
inning, but Tampa was unable to
get a runner across the plate.
Crouthers gave up a solo
home run in the third, but the
Spartans would not be heard
from again until the ninth inning.
Seibert homered again in the
fourth inning and the Cougars
scored unearned runs in both the
fifth and seventh innings on
Spartan errors.

Then in the ninth inning
with the score 7-1, Humphrey
singled and senior second
baseman M ark Bugger crushed a
home run to left center field to
give the Cougars an eight-run
lead.
Crouthers left the game in
the bottom of the ninth after
loading the bases with two
singles and a walk.
Senior
pitcher
B ret
Giaudrone came in and gave up
two singles to score two runs and
balked in a third, but Tampa
could not keep the late rally
going and lost the first game.
All three Spartan runs in the

Home track advantage was not enough to get
the only two Cougars participating in the National
Collegiate Athletics Association Division II Track
and Field Championships past the preliminaries.
The event was held at Ralph Korte Stadium.
SIUE played host to 21 m en’s events and 22
women’s events.
The three-day event, that started on Thursday
and ended with the finals on Saturday, brought in
600 participants from NCAA D ivision II
institutions across the country.
Fifty-four schools were represented on the
m en’s side, and 59 were represented on the
women’s.
The G reat Lakes Valley Conference was
represented by SIUE, Lewis University, the
University o f Southern Indiana, the University of
Indianapolis and the University o f W isconsinParkside.
Senior Dan Walden and sophomore Ben Hilby

were the lone Cougar qualifiers. Each earned a spot
to run the 800-meter.
In the preliminaries held on Friday, Walden ran
in the third heat and finished sixth with a time of 1
minute, 53.65 seconds.
In the first heat, Hilby finished seventh with a
time o f 1:54.16, just about two second off of his
career and school-best time of 1:51.59.
John Kemboi, a junior from Abilene Christian
University of Texas, advanced to Saturday’s final
after finishing first in heat three o f the
preliminaries, and second overall with a time of
1:50.73.
In the final 800-meter run, Kemboi finished in
first place with a time of 1:50.06.
Since only nine runners were allow ed to
advance to the finals, the top two in each heat plus
the next three best times, neither Hilby nor Walden
moved on.
St. A ugustine’s College o f Raleigh, NC.,
successfully defended its title by finishing on top in
both the m en’s and women’s final team standings
with 80 points apiece.

BASEBALL
from page 6
“C routhers dom inated the
game,” Tampa head coach Joe
Urso said. “It was the best outing
against us all year.”
Crouthers said pitching after
Opel’s home run helped ease the
tension on the field.
“I was a little nervous, but
getting the early lead relaxed me
and I just pitched my game,” he
said.
Opel credited much o f the
success of the Cougars’ hitting to
the aluminum bats used in the
tournament.
In m ost o f the gam es
throughout the regular season,
SIUE used wooden bats, but the
Cougars were allowed to use
aluminum in the World Series.
“I was pleased to use
aluminum bats. It makes a huge
difference,” Opel said.
In
other
action,
the
University o f North Florida
Ospreys got to the second round
by mowing down the Delta State
University
Statesm en
of
Cleveland.
The St. M ary’s University
Rattlers of San Antonio defeated
the Kutztown University Golden
Bears of Pennsylvania to advance
to the second round as well.
The
U niversity
of
M assachusetts-Low ell
River
Hawks knocked off the Central
Missouri State University Mules
of Warrensburg.

In their second gam e on
M onday, the Cougars faced
North Florida. The Cougars
committed two errors, giving up
five unearned runs that cost them
the game. The final score was 73.
SIU E head coach Gary
Collins deviated from his normal
pitching rotation, deciding to
start senior Josh Clark instead of
senior Matt Wilkinson.
“They all pitched well this
season and deserved to start,”
Collins said. “But he (Clark)
didn’t pitch well tonight.”
The first two Osprey hitters
in the third inning reached base
on consecutive errors by Opel
and Bugger. Then North Florida
opened the floodgates and scored
five runs.
After the two errors, Clark
gave up a single to let in the first
unearned run. Clark bore down
and set the next two batters
down, giving up only one run on
a sacrifice fly.
Clark then allowed a single
that scored another run and a
two-run hom er before he retired
the last batter.
The third inning was the
biggest scoring rally of the game
and the Cougars never recovered.
Opel, Bugger and Berra each
hit solo home runs but SIUE
could not muster another run in
the game.

Clark gave up a run in the
fourth and left the game in the
sixth inning when Giaudrone
cam e on in relief. Giaudrone
gave up a single with a man on
third that scored a run credited to
Clark.
Seibert hit a single in the top
of the ninth inning but the rally
ended there with the Cougars
being bum ped into the losers
bracket.
“He kept spinning sliders up
there and we kept missing them,”
Bugger said of North Florida’s
pitcher.
Collins blamed the loss on
lack of hitting by the Cougars.
SIUE scored its only runs on solo
home runs.
“They pitched better than we
hit,” Collins said. “And the big
inning killed us.”
A fter their losses, Tampa
and Delta State met in the second
round. Tampa was ahead in the
ninth inning, but D elta State
loaded the bases and a line drive
went over the left fielder’s head
to clear the bases, giving Delta
State the lead and the win. The
highly favored Tampa Spartans
were the first team o f the
tournament to head home.
The Cougars will take on
either Kutztown or Central
M issouri State at 2:30 p.m.
Wednesday.
