Chancellor answers students’ questions
BY PAUL HOLLOWAY
NEWS STRINGER
The topics ranged from football
to show er lights when SIUE
Chancellor David Werner sat down

for a conversation with students.
The
chancellor
was
accom panied by a num ber of
department heads and administrators
as he met with some 25 students,
faculty and others in the Cougar Den

restaurant in the Morris University
Center for an hour Thursday.
“Why don’t we have a football
team?” one faculty member asked.
She added that she raised the

question herself because she knew
the topic was sure to be come up.
W erner said there are many
reasons why there is no Cougars
football team.

The A m erican D iabetes
Association will hold two events
at SIUE in November to raise
awareness of diabetes.
The ADA is an organization
that funds research and provides
education and other services to

people who have diabetes or
whose lives are affected by it.
The ADA’s mission is to prevent
and cure diabetes and improve
the lives of all people affected by
that disease.
The ADA has designated

Dental School ready to bite the apple
BY TAMARA KANO
NEWS STRINGER
The
Com m ittee
of
Accreditation is visiting the SIU
School of Dental M edicine in
Alton this .week.
The
A m erican
Dental
A ssociation C om m ission on
Dental Accreditation accredits all

dental schools, dental hygienist
programs and dental technology
program s. A lthough it is a
voluntary process, all schools in
the country participate because
dental schools have to be
accredited for their graduates to
receive a license.
Accreditation happens every
seven years, and preparation for

it takes two years. The committee
hands out a set o f required
standards that the school needs to
meet. These standards vary from
very simple issues, such as
having a mission statement and a
four-year program , to more
complex ones, such as instilling
in graduates com petence in
treating patients.

Wannabes dodge party labels
BY BARBARA DUMOULIN
NF.WS STRINGER
Drive down the street in any
city in America right now and it
is no secret that an election is
taking place. But there is a secret.
Many political ads do not tell
voters the candidates’ party or
even what office they are
seeking.
Adeline Petrucci, a voter
who has voted in every election
since Franklin Delano Roosevelt
first ran for president, finds the
advertising very confusing.
“They don’t want people to
know who the person is and

whether they’re a Democrat or
R epublican,” Petrucci
said.
“They try to confuse us. I’ve
heard more people say that they
don’t know who the candidates
are, or what they’re running for.”
Dr. Martha Bailey, assistant
professor of political science at
SIUE, said the lack o f party
affiliation is a more recent trend
in campaigning.
“Party affiliation is still an
important determ inant for the
voter, but candidate-centered
cam paigning is m uch more
common now,” Bailey said. “The
candidates have an interest in
selling themselves.”

Native American culture coming to SIUE
BY VICKI BENNINGTON
FOR THE ALESTLE
To commemorate November
as Am erican Indian H eritage
month, Johnny M oses of the
Nootka and Tulalip nations will
bring the fun and philosophy of
the Northwest coast to the SIUE
Religious C enter Friday and
Saturday.
M oses

in
Edwardsville Thursday and give
a presentation
at Leclaire
Elementary School. At 8 p.m.
Thursday, he will be in the
East Room of the St. Louis
County
Library,
1640
S.
Lindbergh Blvd., to present
“N orthw est
C oast
Stories,
Songs and Teachings o f the
Fall Season.”
These teachings are a part of
the N orthw est’s philosophical
tradition.

Two events will be held at
the SIUE Religious Center. From
noon to 1:15 p.m. Friday, Moses
will present “Spirit and Soul in
Native
N orthw est ' Coast
Philosophy,” sponsored by the
SIUE Philosophy Society. There
will be a celebration from 1 to 9
p.m. Saturday entitled “A
Gathering in the Si-Si-W iss
(Sacred Breath) Tradition of the
Pacific Northwest Coast.”
This open house event will
include stories, songs, dances,
teachings and feasting. The
public is invited to a potluck
dinner that will begin at 5 p.m.
Attendants should bring a dish to
share and drums and rattles to
participate in the singing and
dancing.
Moses incorporates laughter
as one of the main elements of
m edicine,
said
Professor
Greg Fields o f the SIUE

Department of Philosophy.
“He is known for his good
sense of humor, and his stories
are very entertaining as well as
illuminating,” he said.
Moses lives near Seattle on
the Swinomish reservation but
was born in the village of Ohiat
on Vancouver Island, British
Colum bia. His grandparents,
who were know ledge-keepers
and healing people, raised him.
Both died in the 1980s, his
grandmother at the age of 113
and his grandfather at 108.
Moses received a bachelor’s
degree in education at the age of
18 from the University o f British

“It’s good because it may be
the case that you want to vote for

not that important,” Bailey said.
“But it’s also bad because it takes

Guest c o lu m n --------------------------------- Grandma isn’t the only
SIU should listen, work with employees one getting the shaft
We read the editorial by Lori
Browning in the Oct. 4 edition of
the Belleville News-Democrat.
The subject was President Sanders’
fine progress in the fight to save
SIU money by eliminating
wasteful spending habits.
First of all, we feel such praise
is warranted. The effort that
Sanders put forth on this project
was long overdue. However, we
are wondering if it would be
considered saving money if SIUE
Chancellor David Werner, other
top administrators and Sanders
himself received hefty pay
increases ($11,000 per year in the
case of Werner and Sanders). And
would it really be saving university
money since Sanders is also
receiving $14,400 per year to cover
his contribution to the retirement
system? Maybe so, since no one
else in the system will be receiving
such a perk.
Secondly,
we
ask
the

following
question:
Would
spending thousands of dollars of
state funds, which are the
taxpayers’ dollars, toward fighting
unions on the SIUE campus be
considered savings? This is in
reference to SIUE’s plans to
appeal an Illinois Education Labor
Board decision that stated SIUE
violated the law by not bargaining
in good faith over large parking
fee increases and thereby required
SIUE to provide rebates to all
union members. We will be
awaiting Sanders’ answer to this
question.
Third, we are not “after
President Sanders’ head.” We feel
that Ms. Browning insulted us,
along with other hard-working
union members, by quoting that
our concerns were self-centered
and
only
based
on
“job
preservation.” We, the union
members, are fighting to support
our families and are facing a

substantial loss to part o f our
income. For this, Sanders would
fight also. But Ms. Browning failed
to further investigate and include
the fact that we, the union, have
requested a series of meetings with
the directors of SIUE’s Dining
Services and the University Center.
The purpose of these meetings is to
discuss ways for management and
labor to improve efficiency and
thereby save the university money.
In conclusion, we
ask
that President Sanders work
with the unions on campus in
a spirit of cooperation, with
the goal of a better SIU system
for all — administration, faculty,
staff,
students,
labor
and
management alike.

Letter to the Editor
Editor’s columns are
stereotypical
Out of all the sections in the
Alestle, the one I find the most
amusing is the column by Editor
Danielle Belton. Unfortunately, my
amusement is not positive but, in
fact, quite negative. Danielle tends
to write about the most pointless,
stereotypical and uninteresting
topics I can imagine. Throughout
the last month, I have taken an
interest in jotting down particular
occurrences and the problems that I
have had with them.
Tuesday, Oct. 6. “Tommy
University.” We happen to live in a
capitalistic society in which
producers will not produce goods
that consumers are not willing and
able to buy. Obviously, people are
able to buy these goods, and if you
cannot, why knock the ones who
can?
Tuesday, Oct. 13. “Hair there,
everywhere.” It is understandable
to want to represent the AfricanAmerican students here, but since
you choose to do so, please do it
appropriately, responsibly and

accurately. “Hair has always been a
big deal in the African-American
community.” To my knowledge,
hair has been a big deal in all
communities. “With short hair, I
was ordinary. Who wants to be
ordinary?” I am very sOrry if your
hair is the only characteristic that
makes you unique and if the people
in your life only recognize you for
your hair. “And every day 1 see
girls with hair weaves and
extensions to achieve what I was
bom with.” Get off your high horse
and realize that not all girls want to
have long hair. It would also be
wise to refrain from putting down
girls who do wear false hair.
Women have fought hard enough
to gain respect intellectually. As
editor in chief, perhaps less
superficial and more substantial
topics would be more beneficial to
the image of women — especially
African-American women.
Thursday, Oct. 22. “Collective
Invisibility.” Finally, you showed
some sort of intelligence and a
valid opinion, to some extent. You
often speak of your generation yet
only make reference te the black

community. Hopefully, your world
extends beyond this. Black elders
are not the only adults that
stereotype our generation. There is
an overall lack of involvement
in our generation, not just the
black youth.
You represent our whole
student body, yet you seem to have
a fixation on focusing your topics
on the interests of AfricanAmericans. This is understandable
on a small scale, but in actuality,
you are doing the opposite of what
I feel your objective is. By
speaking and making your
references only to the black
community, you limit your range
of topics, which to me makes you
appear less intelligent and in many
ways biased. I am proud to have an
African-American woman editor in
chief of my school paper, yet my
only wish is that you become a
better representative and write
about more substantial and
pertinent topics.

When I watch political campaign commercials, all
I ever see are older people looking back at me. Every
now and then, there will be a dog or a curious 5-year-old,
but no young adults or teenagers. Unlike most
commercials where everyone is 23 years old, campaign
Danielle ads sometimes have virtual dinosaurs preaching to the
Belton audience. Young people aren't in the ads because most
college-age people are not courted by political candidates.
Politicians pay more attention to what our grandmothers have to say.
Want to know why? Old people vote and young people don’t.
It can be raining fire and brimstone and the elderly will be out
there in the voters’ booths with their walkers and umbrellas. People
my age are at home sleeping off hangovers or long study nights.
Most young people can barely tell you who is the governor, let alone
the major issues in this upcoming election.
Young people once voted, or it appeared they did. There was
quite a ruckus years ago to get the voting age lowered to 18. Yet
today, I know very few 18-year-olds who practice their voting rights.
The problem isn’t that there aren’t issues that pertain to young
people. There is an abundance of issues that affect young voters,
ranging from highway expansions to tax breaks for families putting
children through college. The problem is that many college-age
adults do not care. Many of us are cynics who find it much easier to
complain about what is going on rather than do something about it.
Others just have no concern for understanding the ways o f the
governments that surround us. We assume that no matter what,
nothing is really going to change despite who is elected or what
measure is passed. Many of us don’t read the paper, don’t watch the
news and aren’t informed voters.
I believe all this can be attributed to our age.
Young people are often self-absorbed. Once you enter college,
you are supposed to start to understand a bit more about the ways of
the world. You are supposed to see that there are other people
besides yourself who are affected by things. Therefore, an awareness
of society and government is developed. The problem is that this
enlightenment often doesn’t develop till long after graduation.
Hence there is a lack of interest in political issues among young
people. Many young adults are more concerned with whether they
are going to get through that next chemistry exam or whether they
are going to get liquored up this weekend. Voting has no part in their
self-centered worlds.
Young people are flighty. We can look like we are leaning one
way, then the next minute we have completely changed our
perspective. College is a time when we are searching for ourselves
and our futures. You could wake up tomorrow morning a Republican
and go home to bed that night a Democrat. Today you may practice
Eastern Orthodox Catholicism; tomorrow you could be a Buddhist.
Five minutes ago you hated green beans and macaroni; now it’s the
staple of your diet. It’s hard for politicians to know the issues
that concern young people when those issues seem to change at
lightning speed.
Therefore, the politicians find it easier to ignore young people.
Of course, the exact same reasons why John Shimkus, Carol
Mosely-Braun and Jay Nixon ignore us are the same reasons why
everyone in the commercial universe loves us. Nothing like a bunch
of inconsistent, indecisive, self-absorbed young people to buy those
Nikes, Revlon colors and Calvin Klein jeans. It’s rather hard to sell
penny-pinching grandma that $200 Tommy Hilfiger coat.
And it’s kind of hard to get people like me to vote.
Please vote. Our grandparents are not the only ones out there
getting the shaft.

Morning-after kit gets OK
BY PAUL HOLLOWAY
NEWS STRINGER
The
Food
and
Drug
Administration has approved the
PREVEN
Emergency
Contraceptive Kit made by
Gynetics Inc. This is the first FDAapproved product for emergency
contraception that can prevent
pregnancy when used up to 72
hours after sex. The PREVEN
Emergency Contraceptive Kit is
available by prescription from
doctors and other health care
professionals.
The PREVEN Emergency
Contraceptive Kit pill regimen is
the most widely studied and used
emergency contraceptive. The
regimen utilizes special doses of
regular birth control pills which act
before pregnancy begins and will
not affect an existing pregnancy.
Used correctly, the pills in the
PREVEN Kit may result in only
about two out of 100 women
becoming pregnant.
“It is estimated that nearly 50
percent of all abortions and
unintended pregnancies in this
country could be avoided if women
had
access
to
emergency
contraception,” said Dr. Anita
Nelson, associate professor in the
Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology at the University of
California at Los Angeles.
“The availability o f an
effective emergency contraceptive
option with a good safety profile is
a major milestone in w om en’s
reproductive health. Women may
want to discuss keeping the
PREVEN Kit on hand with their
doctors or other health care
professionals in case emergency
contraception becomes necessary,”
Nelson said.
There are more than 2.7
million unintended pregnancies per
year in the United States; nearly
half are due to contraceptive
failure. According to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention,
more than 11 million American

women report using contraceptive
methods associated with high
failure rates including condoms,
withdrawal, periodic abstinence
and diaphragms. These facts led the
FDA to request that Gynetics make
an
emergency
contraceptive
product available in the United
States.
The PREVEN Kit has three
steps: a step-by-step “Patient
Information Book,” a pregnancy
test and four light-blue birth control
pills. The pills in the PREVEN Kit
contain progestin and estrogen.
‘Taking the pregnancy test is
an important step when using
emergency contraceptive pills,”
Nelson said. “Determining that a
pregnancy has not taken place from
sex earlier in the month or in
previous months helps ensure that
the pills in the PREVEN Kit have
an opportunity to work. If a woman
learns she is pregnant, she should
visit a doctor or other health care
professional as soon as possible.”
“The only definitive scientific
evidence indicates that the birth
control pills in the PREVEN Kit
work by preventing or delaying
ovulation. It has been theorized that
birth control pills may also prevent
fertilization of an egg if one has
been released from the ovary, or
that they may produce changes in
the lining of the uterus that could
prevent implantation of a fertilized
egg,” said Dr. Carolyn Westhoff,
associate professor o f clinical
obstetrics and gynecology and
public health
at
Columbia
University. “The pills will not work
if a woman is already pregnant and
will not affect a pregnancy.”
Emergency contraceptive pills
have sometimes been referred to as
“morning after” pills. This is
misleading since they can, in fact,
be taken up to three days after sex,
not just the morning after. The pills
in the PREVEN Kit work before
pregnancy or conception begins
and should not be confused with
RU486, the “abortion pill.”

K oto t
BY SHERI MCW HIRTER
LIFESTYLF. EDITOR
The Kiel Center smoked,
rocked and moshed on Oct. 23
for Korn's Family Values
Tour. The marquee listed
Orgy, Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube,
Rammstein and Korn.
Orgy took the stage and
wanned up the audience in
a rather severe way. The
crowd was covered in sweat
halfway through their set.
Orgy blended industrial
sound with heavy riffs to
create their unique style. They
left the crowd anxious for the
next band.
Limp Bizkit had the most
dazzling stage entrance on the
tour. When the curtain
opened, a giant spaceship with
a huge alien driver was
crashed into the stage. The
hatch opened and out w alked
the band. The crowd was
screaming until the music
started, then they were pitting.
Lead singer Fred Durst
couldn’t contain him self to the
♦
stage during their set. He
leaped off the stage into the
crowd twice. First he ran
around the floor, enticing
everyone to “get up when I
say get up.” And get up they
did. For the first time that
evening, every visible person
in the Kiel was moving and
thrashing. Later, Durst pushed
his way to the center o f the
crowd on the floor and
climbed onto the shoulders of

LEAVES

CRA ZFD

a bodyguard. From that
position. Durst screamed and
head-banged with the crowd
while dozens of scantily-clad
girls ripped their shirts from
their bodies in hopes that he
would touch them. After Limp
Bizkit's set, the crowd was
ready for more.
When the curtain opened
again, a huge Ice Cube model
towered over the stage. Ice
Cube and Dr. Dre came out
and performed for what
seemed an eternity. The rap
duo didn’t seem to fit in with
the tour at all. The crowd
w asn't enthralled either.
Next up on stage was the
German group, Rammstein.
The lead singer for the band
belted out the first song after
setting himself on fire. It
didn’t matter that only a
select, bilingual few in the
audience could understand the
lyrics; nobody was paying
attention to that. M ost people
were astonished that the fireengulfed singer w asn’t
writhing on the floor in agony.
The show continued with
almost every object on stage
being torched at one point or
another. Keyboards, mic
stands and drumsticks all
burned during the set. At one
point, a flamethrower was
used to create fireballs over
the heads of the fans. The
most astonishing stage effect
was yet to come. The
keyboard player scampered to
the center of the stage on all

FA H S

H U H 6 RV f o r

fours, bent over and the lead
singer used a prop to suggest
sodomy. Then, the singer
turned the prop on the
audience and squirted water
approximately 30 feet into the
crowd on the floor. This scene
left most people either
disgusted or laughing
hysterically.
Finally, the moment every
soul in the Kiel had been
waiting for: Korn took the
stage. The crowd was on their
feet and screaming at the top
of their lungs. The band went
into “It’s On,” the first song
on their "Fallow the Leader”
album. The floor erupted into
a mass of flailing bodies,
thrashing each other to
oblivion. The only
distinguishable forms were the
occasional heads, arms or legs
that managed to surface from
the sea of violence.
The temperature rose, as
did all the smoke, to create a
thick haze floating over the
people as the set continued.
Almost every song from
“Follow the Leader” was
played as well as
“A.D.I.D.A.S.” from the “Life
is Peachy” album and “Shoots
and Ladders,” “Blind” and
“Divine” from their self-titled
album. The crowd couldn't
get enough. Lead singer
Jonathan Davis held the
audience in a frenzied trance
without directing one word to
the audience. Nobody could
take their eyes off him.

M ORE

Korn’s latest album, “Follow the Leader,” reached No. 1
on the charts, where it stayed for weeks.
Suddenly, the band left
the stage, everything went
dark and the stage starting
spinning. After rotating in a
half-circle, the lights came on
and Limp Bizkit shared the
stage with the ever-powerful
Korn. The group broke into
“All in the Family,” the song
performed on “Follow the

Leader” by both bands. Once
again, the crowd went
ballistic. When the song
ended, both bands left the
stage and the house lights
came on for the first time
since the show started, leaving
the crazed Korn fans hungry
for more.

Exercise is a breeze on the Arboretum pathways
BY M ARJORIE AMIZICH
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
A jog along the new M yer Arboretum pathways, located on
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville’s campus, makes the
ordeal o f staying in shape a very pleasant one and provides a
means of enjoying nature.
The trees spread their branches wide, shading the pathways.
On a day of drizzling rain, their canopy protects you from
getting wet. On a sunny day, the trees keep the glare out of
your eyes.
The shade that protects human eyes also protects animal
eyes. After meandering for awhile, you can choose one of many
benches to sit on. If you are very quiet and lucky, you might feast
your eyes on a deer, watch the squirrels play, spot different birds
in the trees or enjoy the vibrant colors of the trees during fall.
There are a variety o f things people can do.
A married couple can walk their dog.
A family can hike to a quiet spot for a picnic.
Friends can walk and talk to catch up on each others’ lives.
One can take a bike ride along the bike trail.

People in love can enjoy quiet time together away from their
rowdy friends.
It can be a school field trip about the study of nature.
The arboretum consists o f 30 acres with a paved bike path
leading to an observation bridge. O ff the bridge are trails
through the woods, but the main path will curve all around until
you are back at the bike path.
The paved paths have the only lighting. There isn’t
sufficient lighting o n the nature trails to jog at night. Artificial
light would take away from the natural state of an arboretum, so
people should do their strolling or exercising in the daytime. No
one should feel unsafe, because in the event of an injury or other
emergency, there are plenty of emergency phones along the
paved path.
A good pair of shoes, a backpack, some water, a good set of
binoculars and a walking stick provide the basics for rambling
through the arboretum, but if you don’t take advantage of the
trails now, you'll miss the beautiful fall colors.
If you take advantage o f this adventure, you will discover
the wonder of nature. You’ll find that the great outdoors still has
lots o'f fresh air, so breath deeply.

Say What!?

by Jill Stevens

What was the strangest thing
you saw or did on Halloween?

“I saw two adult women
dressed up as candy at a
parade, fighting kids for
candy.”

Psi’s dressed as Kiss.”

Ask Alii Khat..
)

Alii Khat is not a licensed therapist
and her advice should only be taken seriously if
you are very desperate, or make numerous phone
calls to psychic hot lines.
Dear Alii Khat,
The guy across the hall from me claims he only sleeps when there is a full moon. There
are not that many full moons, so that means he is up wandering around, trying to find
someone to bond with. He freaks me out with weird thoughts that most norm al people
don’t think about. I’m worried he’s going to do something weird. W hat should I do?
Cautious Neighbor
Dear Cautious Neighbor,
Get to know the guy. For real, college is all about meeting people and becoming
close enough for them to give you free stuff later in life. For instance, this guy may
work at Dairy Queen after he graduates and hook you up with free ice cream. Now, if it gets
to the point where he is eating more o f your food and using more o f your toilet paper, you must draw the
line."Seriously, take a piece o f tape and put it in front of y o u td o o r and threaten to kick his a** if he crosses
over it.
Dear Alii Khat,
I sure am glad that we don’t have community bathrooms in the residence halls, but I have to share mine
with three other guys. We may as well have carpeting there is so much hair on the floor. I can’t even
answer nature’s call w ithout putting on shoes! How can we solve this extreme hair loss problem?
W igged Out
Dear W igged Out,
Make a deal with your room mate agreeing that you both will not allow any hair loss. By doing so, you will
find the culprit by process o f elimination. Once the violator is found, buy him some hairnets, and if he
refuses to wear them, he will soon find those same hairs in his toothbrush.
Dear Alii Khat,
Is there such a thing as drinking too much alcohol in college? A1 Koholick
Dear Al,
Well, you know you have a serious problem when you are drinking beer for breakfast instead of milk.
Otherwise, if you have the m oney and you are keeping your grades above failing, drink all you want. You
know, my friends and I had an interesting thought. Each time we go on a liquor run, we spend about $55 or
$60 (there are usually about three or four of us). A keg costs $50, and that would be enough to knock us
and half the people on our w ing senseless. And when your parents ask you what you are learning in school,
you can proudly tell them, m oney management and smart shopping! W on’t they be so proud?!?!

Colon cancer is the second leading cancer kiUer and everyone
aged 50 and older is at risk. More than 50,000 Americans
will die from colon cancer and 131,600 new cases will be
diagnosed this year.
Colon cancer is an equal opportunity disease that affects both
women and m en. This silent killer frequendy begins w ithout symp­
toms and those w ith a family history are at even greater risk.
Colon cancer is preventable— even curable w hen detected early. In
fact, if cancer is found early enough, the patient has m ore than a 90
percent chance o f survival.

-Ana, age 16

Colon cancer screenings are safe and effective and are now covered
by Medicare and an increasing num ber o f other health providers.
There’s even a test th jt can be used in the privacy o f your own
home.

Everybody loves

to

trash teenagers, right?

Maybe they d on't realize th a t we do care. That we can make
a difference. Get involved in Crime Prevention. Clean up parks
Teach younger kids. Start a school or neighborhood watch.
And help make your com m unity safer and better for everyone.
Together, we can prove them wrong by doing som ething right.
