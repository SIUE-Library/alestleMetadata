On Monday, Jan. 22, at 4:30 p.m. the newly formed SIUE
Student M entor Association held its first organizational
meeting to discuss goals and elect officers.
The group was formed in order to improve the retention rate
among freshmen and improve the graduation rate.
“O ur primary purpose is to increase the number of freshmen
who return to SIUE for their second year,” chairman, founder
and Student Senator Randy Hobson said,
The meeting began with Hobson’s explanation of the
association’s purpose. The organization is trying to develop a
program to match sophomore, junior and senior students with
incoming freshmen in order to ease the transition from high
school to college.
“Many students do not return for their second year at
SIUE,” Hobson said.
“Studies show that the first four or five weeks on campus

problems before they get out of hand.”
Guest speaker Narbeth R. Emmanuel was introduced by
Ramon Blakley, student body president. Emmanuel discussed
the frustrations and rewards of becoming a student mentor, as
well as pledging the support of the Office of Student Affairs for
the new organization.
Elections of officers were held, followed by refreshments,
which were provided by the SIUE Alumni Association.
Officers elected include the following: Brian G ororo—
president; Ray G reen—vice president; Vivek R ather—
secretary and Matt Hauschild—treasurer.
G reen closed the meeting by saying that the new
organization is viable and necessary. He also told those in
attendance that the they, as students, were capable of fostering
the growth of the organization.

Illinois man is killed after being hit by car
• An Illinois man who was laying on a highway was struck and killed
Tuesday in St. Charles County.
The victim was identified as Antonio Ray, 20, of Alton.
Ray was laying on U.S. Highway 67, about one mile south of the Clark
bridge near West Alton, at about 1:55 a.m., according to the Missouri State
Highway Patrol. He was struck by a car driven by John Bellitto, 22, also of
Alton, the patrol said.
Ray was pronounced dead at the scene.
Highway patrol officials said they did not know why Ray was laying on the
highway.

House votes to ease water restrictions
• The House voted Tuesday to amend the 1972 Clean Water Act, which will
allow states to set lower quality standards for water used in irrigation ditches
and some other man-made waterways.
“It’s ridiculous and costly to regulate an agricultural drainage ditch like a
pristine lake or a navigable river,” said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of
the House Transportation Committee.
The bill, which must be taken up by the Senate, got support from Western
lawmakers who contended that their states unnecessarily spend millions of
dollars satisfying water quality standards. Several Democrats called the
legislation too broad and said it could result in lowering of health and
environmental standards.

Assassin says Rabin killing not premeditated
• Yitzhak Rabin’s confessed assassin told an Israeli court Tuesday that he
acted “for the glory of God” in shooting the prime minister last November.
But the defendant, Yigal Amir, denied that his act was premeditated
murder, saying that he did not necessarily intend to kill Rabin. He said he was
aiming specifically to remove him from office by wounding him.
“My aim was to shoot him in such a way as to end his activity as prime
minister, either by paralyzing him or, if there was no choice, by killing him,”
Amir, 25, who opposed Rabin’s peacemaking efforts, said.

Mentoring--------------------------------------------------------from front page
For those who are interested in participating as a mentor,
there are several ways to get involved. Eric Maczura is working
on establishing an informational Internet Home Page that
should be running within the next few months. The
organization will also be equipped to send information through
e-mail to interested students.
For those without computer resources, a newsletter will be
distributed on campus, as well as mailed to active members. In
addition, the association will be holding a series of meetings on
the second floor of the University Center at 4:30 p.m. on the
following dates: Feb. 5, Feb. 19, March 11, March 25, April 18
and April 22. University Center Director Mary Robinson will
be acting as an advisor.
“The main thing volunteers will be involved in is acting as
mentors. Attendance at meetings is helpful, but optional,”
Hobson said.
The association’s goal is to attain a membership of 250 to 300
students. Participation in the program also qualifies as public
service in the Kimmel Leadership Center.
For more information, contact Randy Hobson at 692-3819 in
the Student Government Office.

Colorado players ticketed
for video coupon theft
BOULDER, Colo. (AP)—University of Colorado
basketball players Chauncey Billups and Matt Daniel have
been ticketed after they took promotional video rental coupons
off books at a campus bookstore, police say.
Campus police cited the two players Monday after a store
security guard caught them taking five Blockbuster Video
coupons, valued at $10 apiece, from texts at the University
Memorial Center store.
Colorado coach Ricardo Patton said Billups, the team’s
starting point guard and leading scorer, would not start against
Iowa State Wednesday but would be allowed to play in the
game. He suspended Daniel, a backup point guard, for the first
half of the game.
“Even though it may be small in nature, our rules are there
always will be consequences for your actions,” Patton told
KCNC-TV Tuesday. “I think the incident was innocent in its
nature.”

Correction
In Tuesday's issue it was incorrectly reported in the headline
that New Horizon won the College Bowl. It should have said
that Student Government won the College Bowl.

Misinformation sparks killing of man proud of his race
(AP)—Michael Westerman was killed because he
was a Southerner who was proud of his heritage and
showed it by flying a Confederate flag in the back of
his pickup truck. He was murdered by two black
men who felt he was a racist and had no right to fly
his beloved flag. But the conclusions drawn by both
black men about Westerman—and his flag—were
based on misinformation spewed by groups who
survive on hate, and news media that one must
assume has only limited knowledge of American
history or are blatantly anti-Southern. Sadly, the two
convicted black men and their relatives continue to
offer the tiring—and misguided—argument that the
Confederate flag is a symbol of racism.
One judge after another (most recently, a few
weeks ago in Georgia) have ruled that it is not. Yet
groups like the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People continue to use

that argument—and have for years. The news media
has never hesitated in piling it on, too.
Until the last few years, the attacks upon Southern
heritage went largely unchallenged by apathetic
Southerners. One of the results of all this is the
murder of Westerman.The relatives of the convicted
murderers alluded to Ku Klux Klansmen being in
the courtroom and that their presence had
something to do with the verdict. The KKK had
nothing to do with the verdict, if indeed any of its
pathetic members were there.
M urder becomes pretty obvious when the gunman
confesses and you have eyewitnesses admitting there
were carloads of men chasing Westerman and his
wife and that a car with a gun-wielding occupant
blocked them from taking a shorter route to a
hospital after a bullet ripped open Westerman’s
heart. People who dislike Southerners frequently

Resolution of budget could be deferred until November
(AP)—President Clinton and his chief antagonist in the federal budget impasse, Speaker Newt
Gingrich, appear to agree on one thing—resolution of key policy issues could be deferred until after
the November presidential and congressional election.
That may be a good idea. It would permit American voters to express themselves on what are
fundamental differences in Democratic and Republican political philosophies and provide Congress
and the White House, whether the occupant is Clinton or a Republican successor, with much clearer
mandates.
The political divisions over Medicare and Medicaid, the environment, and such issues as the federal
role in education and the size of tax cuts the nation can afford are deep and not subject to easy
resolution.
In any event, referral of issues that reflect the core ideological values of the two political parties to
the nation’s voters in November has appeal.
It would stimulate what could be a healthy political debate and guarantee voters the clearest
choices they have had for many years in evaluating candidates for the White House and for Congress.

Spiraling Medicaid costs caused by Congress
(AP)—One reason Medicaid costs are spiraling out of control is because previous congresses and
administrations kept expanding the program to the point of absurdity.
The most recent example came in the 1989 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. It contained a
little-known provision called EPSDT, acronym for Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and
Treatment services.
Basically, reports The Washington Times, EPSDT gives the nation’s school systems the right to
claim Medicaid reimbursements for special-education services provided to Medicaid-eligible children.
Not surprisingly, if you know how these things work, Medicaid money—originally designed to pay
for national health insurance for the poor and disabled—found its way into many school coffers to
pay teachers’ salaries and buy school books.
By conservative estimates» EPSDT payouts rip off an extra $200 million a year.
Scaling back Medicaid’s skyrocketing price-tag is one of the issues stalling budget talks between the
White House and Congress. The administration wants to spend $9 billion more a year than Congress.
A good part of the gap could be bridged by scrapping EPSDT!

play up the racism issue in an attempt to censor and
deny Southerners their constitutional right of
celebrating their heritage. This is why the civil rights
intimidation charge against the two men convicted in
W esterm an’s death
could

landm ark
implications: civil rights are color blind.
How someone gets racism out of a flag that honors
Andrew, the Biblical disciple of Jesus Christ, should
tell us how effective this message of hate against the
South has become.
Also, it is a flag in which hundreds of thousands of
Southern fathers—90 percent of which did not own
slaves—fought for and died. America cannot thrive
if hate crimes persist—period. We think the man
with whom St. Andrew walked, Jesus, offered some
advice that we would all do well to apply: “Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

Warner Brothers offers video classes for young animators
BIRM INGHAM , Ala. (A P)—Students at
Birmingham high schools could have their hopes of
becoming film animators met through classes beamed
in from Warner Brothers studios.
Instructions from W arner Brothers Feature
Animation in California, delivered into classrooms
through interactive video, could prepare students for
jobs in film, arts and graphics.
With school board approval, Phillips High would
become only the second high school in the nation to
offer such a program and the first to do it through
distance-learning technology, said board member
Barry Clemmons, who has been working on the
project for 2 1/2 years.

UNIVERSITY CENTER BOARD

The board will be asked to approve spending up to
$150,000, most of it for equipment, for an 18-month
pilot program. Each of the city’s 10 high schools would
be allowed to choose two students for the pilot.
The Alabama School of Fine Arts, which would
provide teachers, would send five students.
The school system is in final negotiations with
Warner Brothers, Clemmons said, but the tentative
arrangement calls for Dave Master of Warner
Brothers to instruct students by video at no charge.
And the employment opportunities are great.
“It takes 250 animators two years to make a film
like ‘Pocahontas,’ *’ Clemmons said.
There is such a demand for animators—there are
1,000 vacancies in the industry—that apprentice

animators fresh out of high school are paid $72,000 a
year, he said. They earn more than $100,000 after
completing their apprenticeships.
But not all the students who would attend the
multimedia academy would become animators.
Others would focus on graphics, video production and
other areas in which there is a growing demand.
“There are many jobs in Birmingham that will be
available to these students,” Clemmons said.
The multimedia academy would be patterned after
a program at Rowland High School in Rowland
Heights, Calif., that Master started 17 years ago.
Students from that program get internships with
major studios and many of them go to work in the
studios straight out of high school.

I experienced a situation last week that, quite
frankly, pissed me off. In hopes to get not only a
good story but give a particular campus organization
some press, I sought out this group in the UC, and
the response I got from them can be summed up in
one four-letter word: that word is R-U-D-E, rude!
I got a “look” from one of the people sitting at
the organization’s table; you know what look I
mean. That “As if YOU belong anywhere near ME”
look given by those who bought themselves a
pedestal for Christmas.
After receiving “the look,” I went on to try and
explain my story idea and ask who I needed to talk
to. Nobody had a clue! I take that back; one person
did attempt to find out what I needed to know. The
thing that really peeved me was that this group was supposed to be out there
promoting their organization, encouraging people to join; I certainly hope for
the sake of their membership drive that they did not treat everyone who
approached them this way. But you know what? I’m confident that they didn’t
give everyone the cold shoulder. I’m sure that the “right” kind of people were
given cheesy-fake-plastic smiles and lectured on the joys of becoming one of
“them.” I’m keeping this organization anonymous not because I am “afraid” of
what they will now think of me (like I care) but because I don’t want to
stereotype. Rude people are everywhere, not just within certain organizations,
and it is the “rude ‘tude’” that has put me on my soapbox this week.
I just want to know what people get out of being intentionally rude to other
people. For example, I have a friend who is very critical of her appearance and
relies heavily on the input of others in order to survive (ok, so she may not be
the poster child for self confidence, but hey, she’s a good pal). We were getting
ready to go out one night and had entered the “final primp” stage; you know, the
one where you scrutinize yourself in the mirror for 15 minutes after spending
forever putting yourself together and then turn to your friends and say “Well!?!”
My friend turns to another girl, asks “Well!?! Is my hair ok?” and gets a
response that all of us there wanting to hang this other girl by her pink painted
toenails.
“Its ok, I guess, but why are you wearing THAT? That color is ju s t... bad,”
said this girl, peering down her nose. Now, my friend not only had great hair
but a killer outfit on. The thing was black! How can you say anything bad about
that?
My point is this: my friend asked this other person for her opinion on her
hair. Instead of giving just that, she went on to trash my friend’s outfit. Why?!
What is the point?! That is just plain rude! You know that little kid on “Full
House” who used to run around yelling “How rude”? At that moment, I knew
how that kid felt!
And what about people who just open up and belch in public? That is not
only rude, but disgusting! Icki! I have an older brother who thinks that belching
is an art form. Thirty-five years old and he could probably spell out
“Mississippi” in one belch. I can’t wait until one of his daughters does that
right in front of one of his business clients. Tim, if you’re reading this, quit it!
I realize now that it would probably be rude of me to continue my schpiel
for the sake of being labeled boring and redundant. I’ll try to spew forth a
perkier column next week. Until then, smile. It makes people wonder what
you’re up to.

"It's freezing out here so
don't wear your jacket"
Hey, I understand. You have
one of those soft, lamb leather
jackets, fully lined, cropped
(waist length), pebbled
(textured), with the shearling
notched-collar and turnback
cuffs. It was all you wanted
for Christmas and you told
Santa that if you got that
jacket, you would never ever
ask for anything again for
Christmas! I’ve been there.
So, when Santa delivered,
you were ecstatic. You may
have even slept with the jacket
a couple of nights. Now, the
semester has started and you cannot wait to
wear your jacket on campus. The only
problem is ... it’s too cold outside.
However, you are oblivious to this fact.
On the off-chance that you missed the
weather forecaste, it said that the
temperature would be only 18 degrees with
a wind chill factor of 25 below zero. You
must have heard the 30 mph wind gust
hitting your window and pleading with
you, “It’s freezing out here so don’t wear
that jacket!” But do you listen? No. You
figure you can put on a t-shirt and you will
be warm.
Now you are on campus, scrunched up
like a paper ball, trying to look cute and
hoping you don’t turn into a human icicle
as you make your way from the Peck
Building to the UC.
Like I said, I understand and respect
your desire to be a fashion plate at any
cost. However, if you (male or female) fit
the description of the person I just
described, then let me be the first to tell
you that it is not fashionable to be under­
dressed in cold weather.
I used the leather jacket scenario as an
example, but being under-dressed goes
much further than that. I have seen women
wearing rayon pants. Rayon is a light
Spring/Summer fabric, mind you, and you
might as well be naked because rayon is

also an “airy” fabric;
therefore, it gives you no
protection from the Arctic
wind gusts. I have seen men
wearing no jackets—only a
sweatshirt or sweater with
jeans. Their hands are buried
in their pockets, their
shoulders are raised above
their ears, their mustaches
are stiff from the cold, their
faces are bright red, and they
have that “I’m cool” smile
frozen on their faces. You
know what I am talking
about. Most of them are
probably in bed now with the flu.
The point is that you don’t have to be
under-dressed to look nice. Pay attention to
the fabric your clothes are made of.
My favorite winter fabric is wool. Most
people think of wool as a heavy fabric.
They are afraid that they will be fine when
they are outdoors, but once they get in the
classroom, they will over-heat. Please note
that there are many different types of wool.
Some are light and some are heavy.
For instance, if you are a person who
insists on wearing rayon for comfort
reasons, then try a poly/rayon crepe or a
rayon/acetate crepe. And for you casual
people, those denim jeans and cotton/knit
leggings will always keep you warm.
Someone asked me if I liked the bright
color bubble jackets. That particular jacket
is something that has always been popular
for skiing. If they are filled with
Thermoloft®, they are very warm as well
as water resistance. They are ideal for the
casual dresser. However, some people buy
the jackets in those blinding bright
Spring/Summer colors (such as yellow and
orange), which is fine if you are a child
because it makes you more visible, but if
you are an adult, who is not out on the
slopes, and wants to be fashionable, then
bright colors are not appropriate in the
fall/winter season.
Keep warm, and stay true to fashion.

Tuetken has come a long way with basketball career
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
It could have been the sixth-grade coach who
wanted her because she was tall.
Maybe it was the high school coach who kept her
motivated.
Perhaps it was her parents, who tried to see all of
her games.
Or it could be all of those weaved into one.
Several factors have seemed to influence the
basketball career of junior SIUE forward Amy
Tuetken.
Tuetken said one of the only reasons she got into
basketball was because she was taller than most girls
in the sixth grade and the coach obviously saw some
potential in that.
As she made it through her junior high years,
Tuetken ran into a very influential high school coach
in Jerseyville, 111., where she was born in 1975, and
where she has lived since.
“She (her high school coach) was a very good
coach who always kept the team motivated,”
Tuetken said inside the gymnasium at the
Vadalabene Center.
“We respected her. Actually, she demanded our
respect, but I guess I can say she got me where I am
today.”
Jeremy Paschall/A/esf/e
Lori Sebastian, another Jerseyville native who
Junior Amy Tuetken provides veteran leadership to
happens to hold several SIUE women’s basketball

records, influenced Tuetken’s decision to come to
SIUE.
“I talked to Lori about it and she really liked it
here, so I decided to try it. Plus, I really liked all the
other people around here too,” Tuetken said.
Tuetken, an elementary education major, started
all 28 games her freshman year, then played in 27
games the following season. One of the things head
coach Wendy Hedberg has seen and liked about her
is her ability to play several aspects of the game.
“She can step out and hit the three or post up for
a shot. She is very versatile,” Hedberg said.
“Every game she is assigned a post player to
defend, and usually the player is over 6 feet and she
does a good job.”
Since the beginning of the season, Tuetken has
been considered one of the veterans on the team
and one of its leaders. When and if she is called upon
in waning moments of the game, she said she will be
ready.
“If I have to score I will step up, but everybody
seems to be doing this. Usually it is Terri (Evans) to
do it, but if I have to, I will,” Tuetken said.
Hedberg said Tuetken has been pretty solid and
one of their go-to players. Her 47 percent field goal
shooting is one of the reasons.
“She has been shooting very well for us all year.
Regionally she is seventh in field goal shooting, and
we won’t hesitate to go to her down the stretch,”
Hedberg said.

Cougar grapplers bring
home three second-place
finishes from Invitational

For the first time this season, the Cougar

By Brett Licata
Sports reporter
Last Saturday at the Central Missouri State University
Invitational, the SIUE wrestling team saw three of its wrestlers
place second in their respective weight classes. Several other
team members also ranked in top spots.
The 126-pound weight class featured two of SIUE’s top
wrestlers. Brian Anderson lost to Dane Valdez of Oklahoma in
the championship, while Chris McElwee ended up taking fifth
place.
Jason Querciagrossa lit up the 142-pound weight class,
making it all the way to the final match, but was stopped by
Joey Heckel by a score of 4-2.
“Iam really proud of our performance. These guys wrestled
extremely hard,” coach Larry Kristoff said over the phone
Wednesday afternoon.
Jason Carter rounded out the trio of Cougar finalists in a 63 loss to John White of Missouri Valley in the 190-pound weight
class. Carter is currently ranked eighth in the nation in his
weight class.
Next up for the squad will be a dual meet on Friday in
Edmond, Okla. SIUE will face the likes of Central Oklahoma,
North Dakota, Portland State, Ashland, Western State, Adams
State, Karson Newman, Chadron, North Colorado, South
Colorado, Fort Hays, Central Missouri, Nebraska-Kearney, San
Francisco State, Wisconsin-Parkside and Indianapolis.
The wrestling team, as a whole, holds a record of 0-2 so far
for the season. Most of their matches are tournaments that
only count toward individual records and do not reflect team
standings.
The team will finish out its regular season schedule in a little
over two weeks, and will then, go on to. NCAA Division II
regional action.
.
;
“This should be a real test for our team," Kristoff said about
the upcoming meets.
“There will be some stiff competition at this weekend’s
meet.”

Comer hosts a freshman. I chose Kim Lowe
of the women’s team for her contributions to
the Cougars’ 70-59 coiueback victory over
GLVC rival Quincy University last Saturday
night.
Women’s coach Wendy Hedberg is known
for playing whoever gets the job done, and
Lowe has impressed her. Thus far, Hedberg
has had this to say about her diaper dandy:
“She still makes freshman mistakes, but
she does other things well. She can run the
floor well and has a nice outside shot,”
Hedberg said.
Against Quincy, Lowe had a complete
game. She scored 16 points, making 6-of-ll
from the floor, 2-of-4 from downtown and
also added two free throws.
The 5-foot-9 forward from Hamilton, 111.,
also chipped in with seven rebounds and four

Tuetken______________________
from previous page
Up until this year, TUetken had mainly
relied on shots inside the three-point line, but
all of a sudden, teams have begun to respect
her as a long-range threat.
“It is a new added dimension,” Hedberg
said of Tuetken’s three-point shooting.
“I tried to get her to shoot it last year, but
she wouldn’t do it. I don’t know what
happened during the summer, but now she is
one of our most reliable from out there.”
As a junior with one more year to go,
Tuetken would really like to win some
tournament games before she leaves SIUE.

This year’s team was considered to be
average and was expected to finish low in the
Great Lakes Valley Conference. The chances
looked slim for Tuetken and team to win any
tournament games at the beginning of the
year, but, so far, the Lady Cougars have played
far beyond their expectations.
“I think we were considered an underdog ,
and whenever you’re considered that, you
always want to go out and try even harder,”
TUetken said.
“If we hustle and try every game, then that
is all you can really do.”
So, whether it was the coaches or her
parents who helped guide her along the
basketball floors, Tuetken has come a long way
from her Jerseyville sixth-grade team.
