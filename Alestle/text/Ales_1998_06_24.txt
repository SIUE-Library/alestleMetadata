Thefts on campus
should be cause
for concern for
students and staff

Commission to use funds to both purchase and
renovate home, not to just to buy frat house
■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
e d it o r in c h ie f

The
Madison
County
Historic
Preservation
Commission
said that the
$500,000 dollars they have
received was not to purchase the
Sigma Phi Epsilon house, but to
both purchase it and renovate it.
The money the commission
received was not to be used to
solely bid on the home, which is
not worth half a million dollars.
The historic Stevenson home is in
need of great repair to preserve it.
The funds would be used to
buy as well as restore the home.
The Alestle made a mistake
in its June 17 issue by running the
headline, “Commission makes
$500,000 bid for Sigma Phi
Epsilon House...” This headline
was incorrect.

Currently the home is
occupied by the members of the
Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity,
with it’s chapter’s alumni as the
owners. It will be the alumni’s
decision whether or not the home
will be sold.
Fraternity president, Jason
Holtgrewe, expressed concern
about this on June 16 in an
Alestle interview. The fraternity
wants to be assured that if the
house is sold they will have a new
place to live.
Holtgrewe said that the best
case scenario for the Greek
organization would to be able to
build a home on campus.
The Stephenson house has
been home to the SIUE-based
fraternity since 1982. It is
considered to contain some of the
best
woodwork
and
craftsmanship for its time period
in the state.

Bob FehringerM/esf/e

The Stephenson Home, now home to the Sigma
Phi Epsilon Fraternity at SIUE, is in need of
renovation and repair. The Historic Preservation
Commission plans to use the money it’s acquired
to purchase and fix the home.

A six thousand dollar piece of laser
equipment, cow print seat covers,
CD/cassette car stereos, cellular phones
and a pair of sunglasses are just some of
the things that have been reported stolen on
campus here at SIUE since the beginning
of the summer session.
As the temperature rises, it seems as if
employees and students are even more at
risk of having their car broken into or items
stolen on campus.
There have been several car break-ins
as well as stolen purses and wallets in the
Communications Building. The SIUE
police department has offered these tips to
help students keep from becoming victims
on campus.
SIUE campus police advise that
students should lock all items of value in
their trunk and not leave them where the
items can be in full view of potential
thieves. Students should park in well lit,
busy areas on campus. Never leave
important information or credit cards in the
car — take them with you.
Since the summer session began,
there have been seven reported vehicle
break-ins ranging from all over campus
and extending into the East St. Louis
campus. The collective estimated loss
totals over $2000.
Most of the items stolen were car
stereos, but cow print set covers, gold
jewelry and tools were also stolen from
vehicles. Aside from the car burglaries,
there have been several reports of stolen
items on campus.
There have been eleven reported
thefts; nine of the robberies were of items
under $300, but a $6000 Topcon rotating
laser and a $2000 Gateway computer were
stolen as well.
These thefts included mountain bikes
from apartment buildings, a cordless drill
from the Art and Design building, a
walkman, two purses and two wallets, a
cellular phone and a pair of Oakley
sunglasses from the desk of a staff member
in the Communications Building. Credit
cards and cash were among many of the
items stolen, thus totalling a collective loss
of nearly $9000.

THEFT
-------------from page 1
Many
of
these
thefts
occurred in the Communications
Building (2); Alumni Hall (with 2
in the same evening); and
Woodland Hall, Cougar Village,
the Residence Hall construction
area, the Religious Center and the
Art & Design building each have
one. The origins of the two other
thefts is unknown.
To better protect items in
campus housing, the SIUE
campus police suggest keeping
wallets, cash, checkbooks and
jewelry out of open view. They
also suggest marking the most

common stolen items (television
sets, stereo equipment) and
keeping lists of serial numbers,
model numbers and descriptions.
The campus police also
suggest that students always lock
their doors and windows even if
they are only going to be away
from their apartment or dorm
room for a little while. Many
Woodland Hall residents don’t
always lock their rooms when
they go visit other rooms, leaving
themselves vulnerable to theft.
If students or staff need to
report a stolen item, they should
contact the University Police at
ext. 3324.

Editorials from around the

Clinton’s Botched China
Policy
Bill Clinton defends his
China policy by presenting a
false choice. America can either
isolate herself from the world’s
largest country, he says, or
pursue
his
brand
of
“engagement.”
Here’s
Clintonian
engagement: on the same day the
president called his China policy
“principled” and “pragmatic,”
witnesses
told
a
Senate
committee the administration is
ignoring evidence of Chinese
missile proliferation.
Former CIA official Gordon
Oehler said officials are virtually
certain China sold Pakistan 34
nuclear-capable M-11 missiles in
late 1992. Under an international
agreement, the kind Clintonites
normally relish, evidence of a
missile sale would require
Clinton to cut off almost all hightech trade.
Instead of accepting C IA
findings,
Oehler
said,
administration officials quibbled
with the evidence. Senior aides
wanted clear photographic proof
by spy satellites. CIA analysts
were “very discouraged to see
their
work
was
regularly
dismissed,” Oehler said.
Engagement? How about
appeasement?
Willful ignorance of China’s
missile trade doesn’t convey
American
values.
It
tells
mainland China the U.S. values
trade over lawful international
conduct, and that Beijing won’t
be held accountable for bad
behavior. Such a policy is
neither principled nor pragmatic.
It’s dangerous.

From the Daily Oklahoman,
Oklahoma City

understand what they have done
wrong to warrant that type of
attention of the government.
This is a democracy that
should encourage business in our
country — however small or
large.
The government is placing itself
in a tenuous position of trying to
roadblock business in this
country. Our work ethic has
come into question when we are
punished, instead of rewarded,
for working hard.
It is easy to blame big
business for some of the
country’s problems, and some of
the blame is warranted.
But government has missed
the mark on this question and
should back off and let the
country get to work.

The Woodward Case
None of us were there. We
can never be sure precisely how
the Eappen baby died. The
English
au
pair
Louise
Woodward has always protested
her innocence. But yesterday
seven judges of the supreme
court
in
the
state
of
Massachusetts upheld the trial
judge’s verdict of manslaughter
and ruled by the narrowest of
majorities that the 279 days she
had already served in jail was
sufficient sentence.
Some will say she is lucky to
be free. Others will maintain that
she does not deserve to be
branded a killer.
But our guess is that most
may well agree that, though the
checks and balances of the
American legal process by which
Ms. Woodward’s fate has been
so meticulously determined are
different to ours, justice has
been done.

Haiti’s Illegal Drug Trade
Like an immutable force of
nature, the international illegal
drug trade tends to follow the
line of least resistance.
Throughout most of the
1990s, an estimated 70 percent of
the cocaine that was intercepted
en route from Colombia to the
streets of American cities had
moved through Mexico.
But
the
federal
government’s intensified effort
to secure the boundary and
increase the resources of the
Border Patrol have caused many
cocaine traffickers to take the
high seas instead of using the
overland route.
Gen. Barry McCaffrey, U.S.
drug policy chief, said Haiti is
emerging as the key trans­
shipment point for Colombian
drugs destined for South Florida.
The stakes for impoverished
and rudderless Haiti couldn’t be
much higher.
With
no
functioning
government and a fledgling
civilian police force, it needs all
the help it can get from U.S. drug
fighters to prevent the cocaine
cowboys from turning it into the
western hemisphere’s pipelineof-choice for illegal drugs.

occurred recently: a youth
opened fire on a crowded high
school cafeteria, causing the
death of three students and
leaving 15 others seriously
wounded. In less than eight
months, similar acts have
occurred in six schools across the
United States, all in rural districts
where “nothing ever happened”
to disturb the peace. The ages of
the attackers ranged between 11
and 16 years old. Any analysis of
these attacks should focus on —

why

Letters to the editor

After several conversations with a male peer, 1
realized that the gap between how men and women
perceive sex is much larger than I imagined. I think it’s
time that, the issue should be addressed that (due to nature
or nurture) men and women’s perceptions are different
Danielle and varied.
Some differences are obvious and start when we
Belton
are very young. Men are often encouraged to pursue
women, and when they have sexual conquests, they are often
encouraged by their peers. If women do the same there is often a string
of names that follow to refer to her behavior as being “whorish.” It is
a very large contrast, but it is an obvious one that has been with our
society for a long time. When my mother attended Philander Smith,
traditionally a Christian Methodist and black college, when the girls
got pregnant they were sent home. Nothing happened to the boys that
impregnated them.
But like I said, that’s a pretty obvious double standard. The
real despairing view I found was with rape and sexual harassment. It
is the simple fact that a lot of men don’t know what constitutes the two
because the boundaries aren’t always defined. They know the obvious
ones where a man breaks into a woman’s house or attacks her in a
dark alley or even obvious sexual harassment like groping a fellow
employee. Everything else although, is a huge gray area it seems
for men.
I found that I saw issues of rape and harassment in black and
white. My theory on rape was simple: if she says no or is drunk, don't
touch her; if she’s mentally unstable or underage, don't touch her; if
she’s categorized as having a mental age under 12 even though she’s
obviously 20, don’t touch her. It was all simple to me, but a lot of guys
couldn’t see it.
I got a lot of “what i f ’ scenarios. What if we were both drunk at
the party and had sex, then she decided to change her mind and say
that it was rape because she wouldn't have done that if she weren’t
drunk? Or the even messier one where both parties were drunk and he
didn’t want to have sex with her if he was sober, but did because he
was drunk. Can he accuse her of rape and would it even hold up in
a court?
The only thing I could think of in response was not to get so drunk
that you’d have sex with someone. And that goes for both men and
women, but that doesn't mean much. The weekend comes and it’s a
college campus. Someone is getting plastered this weekend, and they
don’t care that you’re drunk you’re basically asking for trouble The
issue with rape is who has the power. There’s not a lot of women going
around raping men, because rape is about power. And when it comes
to sex, who has the power? Mechanics will tell you that it’s the man.
That’s why a story where “ she raped me,” might not always hold up
in a court. Also, this is where perceptions of sex come in to play.
Women can see sex as a form of recreation, procreation and violence
and perceive it in that manor. Therefore with a woman, often sex with
someone she loves or is interested in could be enjoyable, but having
the same thing happen against her consent is perceived as violence.
And it’s doesn’t matter whether the man thinks she wanted it or was
flirting with him. If she wasn’t in her right mind, or said no, it was
rape, or you’ve just put yourself where she could see it as rape.
Maybe that girl that was drunk at the frat party last weekend
really did want to have sex with you, but I wouldn’t always take that
risk. When you’re drunk, you’re not in control; when you’re not in
control, you’re in trouble.

Poshard would push
anti-smoking bill if
elected governor
CHICAGO (AP) — Glenn Poshard claimed
Monday that U.S. senators bowed to
tobacco-lobby campaign money in killing
an anti-smoking bill last week, and he
promised action at the state level if he is
elected governor.
“We must prevent another generation
of youngsters from getting hooked on
cigarettes,” Poshard said.
The Democratic congressman from
southern Illinois said as governor he would
push legislation designed to combat youth
smoking, but he said he has not had time to
work out any specifics.
He declined to commit himself to a
cigarette tax increase — a crucial part of the
federal legislation.
“We will have a strong proposal,”
Poshard said.
The Senate effectively killed the
comprehensive anti-smoking bill in two
June 17 procedural votes that closely
paralleled party lines. Illinois Sens. Carol
Moseley-Braun and Dick Durbin, both
Democrats, each voted to keep it alive.
Republican
senators
dismissed
criticism that they were responding to
contributions from the tobacco industry.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, RMiss., had said the cigarette tax increase in
the bill, which would have raised the price
by $1.10 a pack, was too high.
Senate critics of the bill also said a
massive advertising campaign launched by
the tobacco industry had convinced the
public that the bill was a tax measure and
thus turned opinion against it.
Poshard scoffed at that claim.
“You will be told that the industry
spent millions of dollars on advertising
against the U.S. Senate bill,” Poshard
said. “I'm sure they did, but it was a charade.

Todd Spann/Alestle

A young boy participates in the KSHE Radio 3-on-3 Soccer Tournament for Kids. The event sponsored by
KSHE, a St. Louis-based rock station, took place over the weekend.
It was a cover. Legislators don't vote on the
basis of TV ads.
“The ad campaign was window
dressing,” Poshard said. “It's the millions of
dollars poured into campaign coffers
through PACs that killed the bill, and we
know it.”
Political action committees are groups
formed by companies, labor unions and
others to contribute to congressional
campaigns. Their contributions to any
given candidate are limited to $5,000 for

the primary election and $5,000 to the
general election.
Tobacco companies are among many
groups that operate PACs. Poshard has
been a persistent critic of the PAC system
and has refused to accept any contributions
from them.
Currently pending is a lawsuit filed by
Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan against
the tobacco industry, which seeks to bar
cigarette ads aimed at children and collect
Medicaid costs incurred by the state as a

result of cigarette smoking.
The suit claims that Illinois taxpayers
have paid out $80 billion in Medicaid
expenses since 1980 because of health
problems directly related to cigarette
smoking. Similar suits have been settled in
other states.
Ryan spokesman Dan Curry said
Monday that while it is not known if the
Illinois suit will be settled, it is about a year
from the trial stage.

SWING!
■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
cstulce@siue.edu
Okay, so I can understand road
rage. Some bastard cuts you off
on a hot day, and you follow him
to his house and beat his skull in
with “The Club.” I call that
justifiable homicide.
But what I don’t believe is
that today’s pop music artists are
trying to drive children crazy.
Apparently that’s what some
jackasses up on capital hill are
trying to say. Not too many years
back, Tipper Gore and her posse
of “do-gooders” attempted to
save the youth of America by
forcing record companies to put
warning labels on so-called
“obscene” music. This way the
parents could be warned of the
dangers of those dangerous
musicians and their wacky
ideas. I don’t know about you, but
when I hear Prodigy’s “Smack
My Bitch Up,” it doesn’t make
me want to go bust caps in my
speech class.
The only “obscene” thing this
little crusade against record labels
didn’t do was slap the warning
stickers on much more deserved
acts like Yanni: “Waning: Money
about to be wasted. Put the cd back
on the shelf and walk away.”
Now they say the warnings
aren’t harsh enough. I agree that
the current labels aren’t working.
Some brain-dead kids today look
specifically for the little black and
white invitation just to hear some
curse
words
and
sexual
innuendoes. But let’s not blame
Marylin Manson and Tupac for the
decline of the nation just yet.
I think that before music labels
are changed, we need to start
putting labels where they really
belong: on the kids and parents.
That way these little accidents
could be prevented.
“Uh oh, Jimmy, this here label
on your head says you’re prone to
psychotic fits of rage. I think
you’re going to have to sit this
game of dodgeball out.”
Or better yet, start neutering
these parents before they have a
chance to screw up big time. I
know I didn’t grow up in the
South, but maybe a shotgun isn’t
the ideal gift for a four year old,
Jeb. But hey, I’m just one guy with
a typewriter; what do I know?

BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY
COME TO ST. LOUIS TO
TREAT THE KIDDIES TO
SOME JUMP BUIES MAYHEM
BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
It don’t mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.
But that’s one thing Big Bad Voodoo Daddy
doesn’t have to worry about. With their zoot
suits, fedoras and spectator shoes, they’re
starting a riot that’s spreading all across the
country. Friday night they will once again tear
the roof off another St. Louis club, Mississippi
Nights, at 8 p.m.
The jum pin’ group plays original
compositions that have a ‘40s big band sound,
mixed with ‘90s flair and flash. In February, the
eight-man jump blues revue released their
major label self-titled debut on EMI-Capitol
Records, and they’ve been touring constantly to
promote the album since. Back in 1992, when
the group began its incarnation, they started to
find the roots of their unique sound.
“Our first show ever was at a theater called
‘The Plaza Players’ in Ventura [Calif.],”
drummer Kurt Sodergren said. “It was after
an art walk. They had poetry readings and a
one-act play and a guy with a guitar. It was
pretty mellow and pretty artsy. Then we got up
there and we’re wearing sort of a mish mash
of vintage suits and combat boots. And we
ripped through the set of seven songs we were
working on and floored the place. They had
no idea what they were going to get. It was out
of control.”
Once the band made their mark in
California, they regularly began headlining the

famous Derby in Los Angeles. It was there
where they would perform their careerchanging experience. A fan of the band,
writer/actor Jon Favreau asked Voodoo Daddy
if they would be interested in performing in a
movie he was writing called “Swingers.”
It was their scene-stealing performance in
the hit art-house film that would help propel
them into the mainstream. Two years later,
with swing music being played on Top 40
radio, Voodoo Daddy is poised to become
even bigger.
They recently performed at film premieres
like “As Good as It Gets,” and even headlined
a New Year’s Eve Party at Bruce Willis and
Demi Moore’s house.
“There were a lot of great things that

happened that night,” said Sodergren. “For one,
my wife and I conceived a child at his house, so
that was pretty cool. We got to snowboard for
three days and that was a blast. We got to play
onstage with Bruce Willis, and Demi Moore
was traveling around the room with trays of
snacky cakes and cleaning up. It was a blast.”
O f course swing music may be hot now,
with bands like Cherry Poppin’ Daddies and
Royal Crown Revue popping up on MTV, but
will it last long enough for Big Bad Voodoo
Daddy to make it to the top of the charts?
Singer-songwriter-guitarist Scotty Morris
has the answer. “Good music is not a novelty.
Yes, the swing scene is a scene, but great bands
can emerge from scenes. This scene may come
and go but this band has come to stay.”

Twenty million fan boys (and
girls) can’t be wrong. The “XFiles” movie arrived in theaters
last weekend with a big bang. The
small screen exploits of Scully and
Mulder were brought to the big
screen, to much fanfare, and only a
little disappointment.
The filmmakers were careful to
keep the fans happy and to attract
new viewers with a storyline that
touched on events from the last
few seasons, but not enough to
confuse new spectators. FBI
agents Scully and Mulder try to
discover whether the ramblings of
a conspiracy theorist played by
Martin Landau hold water or not.
Meanwhile, tiny bits are revealed
of the large government alien

conspiracy picture, but not enough
to explain what is really going on.
Unfortunately, the movie is just
a two hour episode of the series,
with a little bit better special
elfects. All of the actors do a fine
job, but no new ideas are explored.
Although, a tease at romance
between David Duchovny and
Gillian Anderson’s characters is
touched upon for a moment.
It’s hard to decide whether
bigger changes for the movie
would have helped or hindered it.
It was great to see appearances by
series regulars The Lone Gunmen
and the Cigarette Smoking Man,
but I still left the theater feeling
like I missed something. Or rather
the
filmmakers
missed
an
opportunity to do something great.
But there is always next season.

U.S. Open: Track and Field's Farewell to JJK

Joyner-Kersee to make last run at SIUE
Jackie Joyner-Kersee runs
to a first place finish in the
100-meter hurdles in the
1994 Olympic Festival held
at SIUE. Kersee will be
returning to Ralph Korte
Stadium next month for her
last run on American soil.
USA Track and Field is
calling the event U.S. Open:
Track and Field’s Farewell
to JJK. The location gives
fans in her hometown of
East St. Louis a chance to
pay tribute to the star.

News from the
fou l line
By Todd Spann
Ralph Korte Stadium is
being expanded from 3,000
seats to 10,000 seats to
accomm odate
Jackie
Joyner-Kersee’s curtain call.
In all actuality, the
biggest news to a lot of
students is the fact we have
a stadium.

To be honest, I can’t call
myself a soccer fan. I would
almost rather watch the
W B prim etim e television
line-up.
But I can respect the
sport. A n d it is mostly due
to there non-tolerance of
misbehaving players.
The
F IF A ,
soccer’s
governing body, suspended
five players for misbehaving
in last Thursday’s W orld
Cup games.
Even
star
French
playmaker Zinedine Zidane
was hit with a two-game
suspension for stepping on
an opponent.
The F IF A deserves some
credit when dealing with
misbehaving
players,
a
quality that top Am erican
sports sometimes lack.

SAMMY |
W ho w ould’a thunk it?
(Spoken in my best Harry
Carey voice.)
Sammy Sosa is on the
heels of M ark M cGw ire in
homeruns, and plus he is
looking like a legitim ate
hitter batting in the .300’s.

putting in a good word
for Sammy.

said.
“W e’re
delighted that the national and
