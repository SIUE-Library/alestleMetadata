Repairs put a chill on the campus
BY KIM O 'BRECHT
NEWS STRINGER
The temperature is dropping
— inside. That’s right, there will
be no heat or hot water inside

most of the classroom buildings
on campus this week.
Facilities M anagement shut
down the high-temperature water
system. The HTW system
generates heat and hot water to

most of the campus buildings
inside
Circle
Drive.
The
buildings will be without heat
and no hot water will be available
in lavatories, labs or darkrooms.
The weather report offers

some good news. Daytime
tem peratures throughout the
week are expected to be in the
low to mid-70s.
Bob Washburn of Facilities
Management said the shutdown

is necessary for two reasons. The
main reason is so construction
workers can create a system tiein for the new engineering
building.

4 charged in dorm attack
BY DANIELLE BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
Four SIUE freshmen have
been charged with felonies for
allegedly attacking two other
students in Prairie Hall.
The Tuesday attacks have led
to the arrests of Craig Johnson,
18, of Country Club Hills, James
Fountain, 18, of East Carondelet
and James
Robinson
and

Kenneth Allen, both 18 and of
Chicago.
Housing D irector M ichael
Schultz advises that students
should “keep your doors locked
at all times.”
The freshmen allegedly
donned masks and entered
the victim s’ unlocked rooms
around 1 a.m. One student was
struck with a belt, another was
hit with a fist. Both of the

victims are freshmen.
All of the suspects have been
charged in M adison County
Circuit Court with two counts ol
aggravated battery and one count
of criminal trespass. All of the
charges are felonies. They were
also charged with misdemeanors.
All four students could face
expulsion from the university
according to the Student Conduct
Code.

This Halloween, give blood
BY BARBARA DUMOULIN

A spider waits for dinner on its web.

Eighteen-month-old Gabriel
McGee knows the importance of
.blood. M cGee, whose mother
was born
and
raised in
Edwardsville, has a very rare
type of hemophilia and will need
to receive a blood product every
day for the rest of his life.
Am erican
Red
Cross

representative M arlene Bauer
said McGee and others like him
are what makes the need for
blood so great, especially at this
time of the year.
“ By the last week of
October, supplies start to slack
off,”
Bauer
said.
“With
Thanksgiving and Christm as
coming up, giving blood drops to
last on the list of things to do.”

For that reason, Bauer is
hoping for a good turnout of
donors at the Red Cross blood
drive which takes place from 10
a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday and
Thursday in the secpnd-floor
conference center in SIU E's
University Center. The blood
drive is co-sponsored by the
Greek Council and the American
Red Cross.

Locals take part in Tons of Fun event
BY TONY WATT
NEWS STRINGER
Tons of Fun gave more than
1,000 students and friends an
evening of games and activities
as well as giving more than 100
EdwardsviJ^e residents a peek
into college life.
Students and residents got
together for the ninth annual Tons
of Fun Friday from 9 p.m. and 2
a.m.
“I feel like there was really
an attempt to reach out to people
outside of the campus,” said Ray
Green,
a
Student
Senate
representative to the University

Center Board. “For too long it
seemed
that
SIUE
and
Edwardsville considered each
other separate entities. Events
like this bring people together.”
The evening’s events were
geared toward people of all ages
and designed to promote alcohol
awareness, showing participants
that there is plenty of fun to be
had without alcohol or drugs.
“I’ve been to the parties with
alcohol and frankly I’m having
more fun here,” said student
Jamie Currier, president of the
Campus Republicans.
Children
could
shave
balloons, play Twister, or life-

size Sega. They could also
decorate cookies and pumpkins.
Karaoke was popular with
everyone as was the pie-throwing
contest, which featured members
of the UCB taking pies in the face
from anyone who cared to try.
“I’m
ju st
glad
the
participants are having fun,” said
Green with a grin as he wiped
whipped cream from his face and
out of his ears.
There were also poetry
readings, a dance, a variety of
indoor sports and games and a
chance to learn how to scuba dive
in the Vadalabene Center
swimming pool.

organizations volunteered their
time to sponsor and operate the
various activities.
“By being visible at events
like this we show that there is

not make much difference, but
individuals can touch up to four

Past blood drives at SIUE

faculty really gets behind us, it’s
a big motivational tool.”
Donors must be at least 16

is ineligible. Other questions may
be answ ered by calling the

Missing in action: where are the men

a

W hen I came to SIUE as a
freshman, I lived in the residence hall,
now called Woodland Hall. I, like just
about every other girl there, was
interested in finding out who the boys
Danielle were >n the building. I was surprised to
B elton learn that among the more than 500
students in the filled-beyond-capacity
residence hall, there were fewer than 25 black
males. I knew 20 of them just from registration. I,
like many other girls in the dorm, wondered,
“Where are all the men?”
Of course then it was more of a hormonal
question than a philosophical one, but it is a point
to ponder. Why were there so few AfricanAmerican males enrolled as freshmen and why
does the number continue to remain so low?
As I narrowed in on a major, the black males I
saw became even more scarce. The more classes I
took in mass communications, the more I realized
that 1 had attended classes with only two AfricanAmerican males. This was a trend I’ve observed
since I started elementary school. We all started off
the same; girls and boys were about equal in
number. During junior high, the numbers were still
about the same. But in high school, the numbers
changed as I saw the black males shy away from
the clubs and school organizations.
This all reminded me of when my mother
made me read Kwanze Kunjufu’s book “To Be
Popular or Smart.” I was in junior high and^was
basically an outcast. This was not new for me. 1
had been branded as a “nerd” by other black
children and had few friends. The book said that it
was easier for fem ales to withstand being
ostracized for being smart than males. I didn’t
understand it until I got older. I was often told by
boys that I was supposed to be smart and for some
reason or other they were just dumb and couldn’t
help themselves. They often repeated the same
thing: Someone older had once told them that
college was a waste of time. Unable to see past
their own tennis shoes at times, they dwelled on
what was going on in high school as if there would

be no life after high school.
At this point, someone might interject the
argument that due to violence, gangs and drugs,
these teens would only care about the now and not
the future. That might make sense, but these high
schoolers were “county kids.” They grew up in the
overprotective, sanitized-for-your-convenience
world of the suburbs. How did they develop this
defeatist attitude?
Somewhere along their development line,
machismo and racism altered their thinking. Cool
became the obsession. The boy had to be cool to
get the girls, to get the friends and to fit in. Who
cares if you’ll just graduate from high school by
the skin of your teeth? At the same time, somehow
not participating in academics and using slang as if
it were your only language became part of what it
was to be black. Intelligence and proper English
became reserved for white people. I was always
accused o f sounding like a white person because I
didn’t curse or use slang. No one ever thought I
spoke that way because both my parents were
college-educated and one was a teacher. My
mannerisms had more to do with class than race.
So where are all those brothers “missing in
action”? Even historically, all-black institutions
have had stark drops in black male enrollment. It
appears to be a national phenomenon. In Dr. Harry
Edwards’ speech last week at the East St. Louis
Center, he said society is burying, incarcerating
and drug-addicting our future black athletes and
leaders.
I’ve heard this before, but I don't know if it’s
that way for my neighborhood. It’s more like the
less-ambitious of my neighborhood have set a
course to become a generation of 30-year-old
slackers living with their parents.
My philosophical side is telling me this is sad
and the root of this problem needs to be found. The
hormonal side is telling me this, makes for some
slim pickings for dates.

This painting was an affront to many and some of us said

Also, who turned off the chimes o f our campus carillon?
Might they be turned back on? It gave this campus a bit of old

Zombie
rocked
the
crowd
Zombie has the Halloween spirit alive in his heart.
BY SHERI MCWHIRTER
LIFESTYLES EDITOR

Move over Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Zombie is on
the move. Between m ind-boggling special effects and a
technically perfect perform ance, Zombie rocked the
American Theatre Monday, Oct. 19. Nobody there could
dispute the fact th a t Zombie has the Halloween sp irit alive
in his heart.
Zombie’s stage entrance is by far the m ost im pressive
ever to come through St. Louis. The curtain dropped, and
there sto o d Zombie, the picture-perfect S atan . The
gargoyle face, com plete with gigantic horns on eith er side
of his disto rted head, stood out from the black robe with
frig h ten in g d istin ctio n . In an in stan t, Zom bie spun
around and Satan had vanished. Members from the crowd
spent the next five m inutes either trying to figure out the
special effect or beating and slam m ing each o th e r around
in the dizzying m osh pit.
The A m erican T heatre was tra n sfo rm e d in to a
dungeon o f so rts for Zombie's concert. The band members
were all on th e ir own gothic pedestals. The bass an d guitar
players slipped off and on them the w hole show. The
guitar w as filled w ith blood, which the player occasionally

squirted into the en th ralled audience. Two large television
screens were placed b ehind the g u ita r players and
repeatedly show ed clips of old, grade B h o rro r films.
B eautiful Asian g irls graced the stage w ith th eir
choreographed dancing a n d occasional head banging. But
the m ost dazzling elem ent on stage was Zombie himself.
Zombie moved across the stage like a crazed anim al
in its own territory. Zombie owned the stage. The only
deviation Zombie m ade from his latest CD, “Hellbilly
Deluxe,” was the occasional missed lyric, due to being out
of breath. W ouldn’t you be out of breath if you p ut on a
mystifying perform ance like that?
The crowd m oved w ith the music throughout the
night. W hether Zombie was playing his own music o r
songs from his days w ith White Zombie, the crowd loved
it. For the encore Zombie teased the crowd w ith w hat he
would perform next an d decided on “Children of the
Grave" by Black Sabbath. The crowd w ent nuts. The floor
resembled a herd of crazed cattle on acid. Zombie m ore
th an entertained the audience th a t night, he scared the
living hell o u t of them.
The opening bands for Zombie were Monster Magnet
and Fear Factory, n eith er of which got much reaction
from the crowd.

Rob Zombie claims his throne as King of
the undead.
