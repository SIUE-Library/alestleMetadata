Baby critically injured by boys, 6 and 8
• Two boys critically injured a 6-week-old baby while breaking into a home
to steal a bicycle, police in Richmond, Calif., said Tuesday.
A police officer at the scene said the boys, 6 and 8. “thought it was a doll”
when they knocked the baby from its crib and kicked him. But a spokesman
said later that they weren’t sure how the infant was injured Monday night.
“From my information, they knew it was a child, and not a doll.”
The baby, whose name was not released, was on life support with severe head
injuries at Children’s Hospital in Oakland. The baby was found lying on a bed
by his 18-year-old stepsister, who came in from another room to check on him.
The parents were at work.
The boys were not taken into custody but were talking to police. They were
neighborhood children, known to the family. The bicycle was recovered.

editorial.

It’s not so hard to say goodbye—believe me!
It’s over. It’s finally over. To some people, my job
as editor in chief could not have ended faster. But
to me, it took entirely too long to be completed.
Now do n ’t get me wrong. I enjoyed some of the
time that I have spent as editor. I’ve had the
opportunity to m eet interesting people, travel to
different schools and learn m ore about people on
this campus than I really cared to. All in all, it’s
been fun and I wouldn’t trade in the experience for
anything else.
But now that I’ve said that, let me address some
complaints that I heard this school year that has
had me bite my tongue until this m om ent.

noon
Through working at the Alestle, 1 have found
that it is virtually impossible to keep people happy.
If it ain't one thing, it’s another.
Last year our advertising staff had a readership
response to see what the students w anted from
their campus newspaper. From the items that I
read, it seem ed that students w anted m ore student
stories and m ore national news. So what did we try
to do this year? We got a wire service for more
national news and we did our best to get m ore
student stories in the paper, but it seem ed to go lost
on deaf ears. W henever we couldn’t get to a certain
group’s event, we were slashed by them. I hear the
comments that you make. We did our best, but I
guess that isn’t good enough for most people.

noon
People also com plained about the m istakes our
new spaper makes. Wow, do any of you watch Jay
Leno when he does his headlines? Those m ajor
new spaper m ake m istakes just like us. D am n, w e’re
human, just like all of you. I would like to see any
of you come to this office and work under the
conditions that we have to work in sometimes. Not
enough reporters. New copy editors it seems every
two weeks. Printing problems. Deadlines. I’m not
asking that you feel pity for us, just have some
understanding. We don’t like to m ake mistakes. We
get em barrassed by them and try our best not to
m ake them.

noon
Faculty and staff! Boy, do I have a bone to pick
with you.
In the beginning of my term as editor, I received
letters from English professors stating that I was
using incorrect gram m ar and some of my reporters
were using incorrect grammar. Then some
journalism professors were saying that our
reporters were using incorrect journalism style.
Well, hello. A re n ’t we, the same students who m ade
the grammatical errors and journalism errors, a
product of your teaching? If we are so bad, then
how did we pass your classes? Before you judge
others, m ake sure that you judge yourself, also.
From your complaining, I have learned one
thing: many people like to complain about things,
but few want to help correct them.

noon
O.K. Now I’m done complaining. Now I want to
thank a few people who have m ade this year
enjoyable.
First of all, I have to thank the one person who
was always there to listen to me complain when the
nights here were long and the printer stopped
working and all the other bad stuff that happened
in this office. To my beautiful Cristina. Thank you
for putting up with my many attitudes during this
year. It’s been long and trying, but we made it and I
hope that we can m ake it another year. Love ya!
OOOO
Thanks to the entire athletic departm ent. Even
though we had to patch a few things up from the
previous year, I feel like the Alestle has started a
new relationship with athletics. Thanks to all the
coaches and players for giving us the interviews
even when SIU E didn’t come out victorious. Brad
H ew itt—you still owe me a lunch. I will get in your
appointm ent book!
Thanks also to that hard-working sports
inform ation departm ent. Eric, in my eyes you still
don’t do a dam n thing, but hell, you m ake it seem
like you do a lot. G ood thing you have Tad and
Colleen working for you. Tadm anian—you da man!
W ithout you, that SID would fall apart. Thanks for

all the help with w om en’s hoops this year. I’ve
enjoyed working with you. You are such the
professional.
□□□□
Thanks J.B. and the Cam pus Rec staff. We finally
got intram urals the recognition it deserves. But J.B.,
we really have to do som ething about this pay scale.
I d o n ’t get enough paid vacations. I’m a veteran
official. I at least deserve that! (Eli said, “ If
som eone ever bum ps me, they better get m ore than
a seven game suspension.”)
OOOO
Now I want to thank Terry Signorello, Dan
Kasten and Mike G enovese for helping me
throughout the year. Terry, I know we butted heads
on many issues and you took a lot of flack about
decisions that I m ade, but I really appreciate it. I
know 1 didn’t show it, but I did. Thanks.
Dan and Mike, thanks for teaching me about
advertising and graphics design, respectively.
W ithout that help 1 w ould’ve had a difficult time
putting this p aper together.
□□CO
Thanks to my interesting, and that word can do
you guys no justice, A lestle staff. I d o n ’t think
anyone can replace your bitching Brian. A nd I
know that nobody can m atch your steppin’ Darryl.
A nd Eli, who else would sit here and talk about the
sorry-ass Cardinals with me but you. A nd Jeremy,
we need one m ore photo, but not one of me in my
underw ear like D an O ’C onner last year. M elanie,
good luck, sucker ... I m ean, you deserve the job. I
hope you have a great year. Melissa, Todd, B rett,
David, Lenon, D anette, Lindsay, Kerri, Shawna,
M elanie and Trudy, thanks for everything. You can’t
put a price on how much you guys m ean to the
Alestle.
OOOO
To 8096: We ain’t never got two things that
match!
Roy Gilmore
Editor in Chief for the last time!

Playboy hits Lincoln for college pictorial
L IN C O L N , N eb. (A P )— I t ’s n o t th a t
Jessica F rench d ream ed about posing for
Playboy. S h e’s just adventurous.
F rench, a freshm an at the U niversity of

annual college pictorial, which goes on sale
in A ugust.
F rench, who w ants to go to law school,
hopes to end up in the “ W om en of the Big
12” pictorial.
“ If I look back in 20 years I know I ’d
regret not doing this,” she said. “ I t ’s a classy
m agazine and d o e sn ’t d egrade w om en. I
d o n ’t th in k I ’d do this fo r any o th e r
m agazine.”
O th e rs said they w a n te d to p ro v e to

enough to do it. Jennifer, who d id n ’t w ant

discovered— and pay telep h o n e and tuition
bills.
“ M ost say they grew up with Playboy on
the coffee table at hom e and found the

betw een interview s at the R am ada Plaza
H otel. “ I t ’s th eir fantasy to end up in the

so p h o m o re H an s Y unge said. “ I t ’s an

W hile others valued their experience, they did have a few suggestions for

On M ay 4,1996, 520 students will take part in SIUE graduation ceremonies.
To gain insight into the mind set of these graduates, we interviewed four students
to uncover their feelings about graduation and to gain some advice for those of

students for graduation.

Some students, such as Tracey Cooley, a senior majoring in management
information systems, "can't w ait to get out and make some money." Immediately

Cooley said that while he gained plenty of book smarts at SIUE, he received
no practical experience.
After four or five years of studying, O 'N eal, Cooley, Duncan and Walker have

"It's overwhelming and frightening all at the same time," Darla O'Neal said.
O 'N eal is a senior majoring in biology.
Students feel that when classes are over, the work is all done. They do not
account for the time that needs to be spent writing resumes and cover letters,
applying for various companies and interviewing.
"I'm pretty stressed out and nervous about it," Derek Duncan, a senior in
mathematics said.
Most May graduates have been very active in the interviewing process the last
couple of weeks.
"I've been interviewing constantly," Cooley said, "twice this week, twice last
week and twice the week before that, but so far nothing is solid."
O 'N eal was fortunate to find a job prior to graduation. Last Monday was her

numerous academic and professional organizations on campus for students to

"Definitely get all the experience you can," Cooley said. "Do internships. They

Duncan said that students should study a lot and get help offered from
instructors and tutoring labs.
O'N eal said that students need to prepare themselves by not putting things off.
"You want to prepare your last year of school like it is your last day of
school," O 'N eal added. "It's one less stressful thing to have on your shoulders at
this time of year."
Students can prepare themselves by writing resumes early, planning for

After her first week in the job market, O 'N eal said that school is definitely

Cooley also said students should not take too many classes in their major
early, especially if they are a little hesitant about their career path. Switching
majors four or five times can really set a student back.
Finally, students should remember to enjoy their SIUE experience, but not to
have too good of a time that would cause a student to blow all of their student
loan money in their first semester.

SIUE alumna to star in play 'Mama' starting April 25
By Darryl Howlett
Lifestyle Editor
SIUE alumna Vickie Hubbard will be performing in the play “Mama,” a dramatic
adaptation of the novel by best-selling novelist, Terry McMillan. The book follows
the trials and challenges o f an African-American mother raising four children on her
own.
Along with Hubbard, the play also features Mardra Thomas, Thomasina Clarke,
Bonnie Harmon, C. Andre Jennings, Karl Clark, Victor Little and Josephine Ball.
The play running from April 25, 26, 27 and 28, at the Unity Theatre Ensemble, is
the fourth play that Hubbard has taken part in since graduating from the university
last May.
Other plays in which Hubbard has performed in since graduation includes, “Raisin
In The Sun,” “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When The Rainbow
Was Enuf,” and “Break/Thru.”
In the play “Mama,” Hubbard plays as many as four different characters including
one of the daughters, Angel and the narrator. Hubbard thinks highly of the play.
“I love this play. It is a very excellent play. It is very entertaining, yet with
comedy and drama,” Hubbard said.
Hubbard also told which character in the play that she best identifies with.
“I like Angel the best because it really pulls a lot out of me emotionally. It

To Tonii, thank you for your bi-weekly fashion

To Roy, you bum. I hate that you’re leaving the
Alestle, but I understand. I appreciate everything
you have taught me over the past year, especially not
to take any crap from people who try to take
advantage of you.
To my copy editors, thank you for making me look
sooooo good! By the way, how do you spell kat?
(Meow)
. To my brothers of Iota Phi Theta, fraternity, inc.,
the colors of the brown and gold are the best colors

To all my new G reek brothers and sisters, if
som eone would have told me a year ago I would
become a G reek, I would have said, “You must be

crazy!” H ow ever, being a p a rt of the greek
community has been a worthwhile experience and I
love you all. L et’s continue to grow in unity and love.
(Hi Tasha, John, C handra, Stacey, Fabian, Marcus
and A m ber.)
A nd to you, my readers on campus, I would not
even be here if it w asn’t for your complaints,
com plem ents and suggestions. You will never know
how much I appreciate you.
I have tried to give you the best lifestyle and
entertainm ent section that you would be able to
appreciate and understand.
To the entire Alestle staff, this year we have
grown in ways unimaginable. We have weathered,
what has been, one heck of a storm and still managed
to come out on top. W hat else can 1 say, you guys are
the best. A nd Melanie, let’s really concentrate to
m ake this paper one which even the journalism
departm ent would say, “D am n, they’re good!”
To my mom, to my mom! I love you mommy.
(Like you guys out there d o n ’t call your m other
“mommy.”)
So, there you have it. The final call. The last dance.
Finito Bonito. Adios, amigos. A nd as always, have a
happy, healthy, God-fearing, hard-working but not
too hard-working, go Cardinals, Six Flags going,

T h e

I recently attended a gala in Chicago. On the invitation it
stated that the attire was semi-formal. Yet, many m en and
women were wearing anything from long white bridal-like
dresses to khaki pants with a denim shirt. A lthough these
misfits were am ong the minority, the inconsistency in attire
still seemed to m ake the event seem off-balance. The MC
began his m onologue by saying, “for those of you who actually
read the invitation ...” H e later said that it was his way of
acknowledging those people who were inappropriately
dressed. However, I believe that the odd balls just didn’t
understand what semi-formal meant.
I
have attended a few events on campus as well where
people were inappropriately dressed. So, I will explain the
different types of attire and give an example of when it is
suitable to wear it.
Formal and Black Tie: W om en’s dresses should be ankle
length. These dresses should be m ade from elegant fabrics
such as Duchess satin, poly/satin, pure silk, and the ever
popular and uncom fortable sequin. If you have the figure, a
form fitting dress m ade from M ylar (either strength or
acetate) is quite eye-catching. M ylar is the m aterial of choice
for those tight-fitting dresses worn by Halle B erry and
Elizabeth Hurley at the academ y awards. However, Lycra is a
good substitute for those on a tight budget. Men, please wear
a black tuxedo. Plain and simple. T here is no greater dis­
service to your date or escort then to w ear a basic suit. Black
tie attire has the same basic requirem ents for formal attire.
Again, men are required to wear black tuxedos. O n the other
hand, women are limited to colors of black, white, and ivory.
Formal and black-tie attire is suitable for cotillions, balls or
proms. It is usually always stressed in a written invitation.
Semi-Formal: There is no length or color requirem ent for
semi-formal attire. However, the dress should still be elegant.
Be careful not to over-dress, so stay away from sequin dresses.
Ladies, also be careful with tight form-fitting dresses. A long
form-fitting dress could m ake you appear over-dressed and a
short-length one could m ake you appear underdressed. M en
can let go of the tuxedo and w ear a dark color suit. This attire
is usually suitable for an awards banquet o r weddings (men
can wear a lighter colored suit if the wedding is held in the
ring or summer).
After Five: Women can w ear a nice blouse with a pair of
dress trousers or a skirt, classy dresses and pant, skirt or dress
suits. Men do not have to w ear suits, but should always have a
dinner jacket or blazer (better restaurants will not seat you
without one). This attire is suitable for that rom antic dinner at
an exclusive restaurant.
After Seven: Women, short form-fitting (hoochie-m om m a)
dresses are fair game. So is leather and tight pants and
anything else you can find at the M erry-G o-Round. M en can
wear anything from suits to a nice shirt, slacks and a tie. This
attire is suitable for night clubs. A t lower scale night clubs,
men and women even w ear jeans.
The other types of attire such as casual and business are
more com m on and, therefore, pretty self-explanatory. Also, if
you are unsure about what to wear, ask the person
coordinating the event or phone ahead to the restaurant or
club you are planning to attend.

Baseball slams their way into GLVC tournament
Spotanski's four run shot stymies N. Kentucky
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor

________________________________________________________________

It took a 10-game winning streak and a
little luck but the SIU E baseball team will
be advancing to the G reat Lakes Valley
C onference tournam ent this Friday when
they hook up against second place Lewis.
Needing to win the final two games of
the conference schedule, the C ougars
found them selves battling N o rth ern
Kentucky for a spot in the tournam ent.
Because the GLVC only takes the top four
team s in the conference, both team s
fought till the very end to try to secure a
position.
In the first game, the Cougars were
down by four going into the final inning
but some late inning heroics by senior
John Spotanski put the Cougars on top
with a game-winning grand slam.
“I rem em ber thinking we needed to get
some runners on base to have a chance
and when we bled one runner home, I then
thought we could do it, but I never thought
it would be with one swing of the bat,”
head coach G ary Collins said W ednesday
afternoon.
A fter the Cougars defeated N orthern
Kentucky 12-11 in the first game, they still
needed one m ore game to secure a spot.
A nd the next game was just as exciting.
The Cougars started the game right
where they left off, scoring five runs in the
innin8’ but N o rth ern K entucky
countered with six of their own in the
following innin
° ¿™ing T n t T t h e seventh inning, the

Baseball grabs a spot on the GLVC tournament brackets with a
doubleheader victory over Northern Kentucky over the past weekend.

Cougars held an 10-7 advantage that soon
disappeared over the next two innings.
N orthern Kentucky rallied with some of
their own heroics to send the game into an
extra frame.
The Cougars need only an extra inning
to gain a victory, and once again it was
done by the long ball. Sophom ore Jeff
R idenour sm acked a two-run hom er in the
bottom of the tenth inning to give SIU E a
12-10 victory and a place in the playoffs.
“I ’m happy for the guys. It shows a lot
of character coming back like they did.
They could have easily gave up a while ago
when we were 7-11 in the conference,”
Collins said.
The C ougars used a 10-game road
winning streak to propel them into the
to u rn am en t with a 17-11 third place
conference m ark and an overall record of
29-18.
“We set out on a mission two weeks ago
and I really didn’t know if we could do it,
but we accomplished what we set out for.
A nd it was fun doing it,” Collins said. “The
tw o gam es o v er the w eekend with
N o rth ern K entucky are ju st about as
exciting as they can get.”
Lewis will be up first for the Cougars
and Collins believes it will come down to
who pitches the best.
“G ood pitching will always beat a good
hitting team and so the team that gets the
best pitching will probably win the game,”
Collins said.
The college baseball rankings has Lewis
at No. 9 and conference w inner St.
Joseph’s No. 4, so the Cougars will have
their hands full, whoever they get to play.

Softball gearing up for
conference tournament
By SIUE Sports Information
The Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville softball team
geared up for its G reat Lakes C onference postseason with a non­
conference doubleheader today.
SIU E, now 32-14 on the year and 12-6 in the GLVC, took on
M issouri-Rolla on the road W ednesday at 3 p.m. R esults of the games
were not available at press time.
Following these games, SIU E heads to Indianapolis, Ind., for the
GLVC Tournam ent. The second-seeded Cougars take on the No. 7
seed Lewis in the first round Friday at 11 a.m. In their only encounter
this season, SIU E downed the Flyers 5-3.
If the C ougars defeat Lewis, they face the w inner of the
Indianapolis-Quincy game in the second round on Friday at 3 p.m.
If SIU E falls in the first round, it goes into the consolation bracket
and awaits the loser of the Indianapolis-Quincy game. WisconsinParkside, the No. 1 team in the latest N C A A Division II poll, takes on
N orthern K entucky Friday at 11 a.m. Southern Indiana battles
Kentucky-W esleyan Friday at 9 a.m.
H ead coach Sandy M ontgom ery said it is im portant how the
Cougars play.
“We need to play well, w hoever it is,” M ontgom ery said. “We are
having a little confidence problem , but we can snap out of it if we play
well-.”
D esp ite dropping four of th eir last six conference games,
M ontgom ery said the Cougars are ready for the tournam ent.
“Everything is tough when it’s tournam ent time, and you can’t
overlook anyone,” M ontgom ery said. “I think we will be fine and we
will be up for the challenge.” '
The double elim ination tournam ent com es to a close Saturday
with the cham pionship game at 3 p.m.

Jeremy Pasctiall/A/esrfe

Jamie Thorp attempts to tag out a runner after she picked up a ground ball hit to second
base during the Quincy game last week. The Cougars will take a 12-6 conference record
into the Great Lakes Valley Conference tournament this coming weekend in Indianapolis.
