And we all* thought the healthy
economy was a good thing.
Due to “unfavorable bidding
conditions” and a healthy construction
market, Cougar Village renovations
have been cancelled for the summer
session. It has been postponed untill
summer of 1999.
A letter was sent to all University
Housing students on Tuesday alerting
them to the cancelled construction work.
In the letter, students were assured that
renovations would eventually occur and
that students who applied for renovated
apartments would not have to pay first
class apartment rates for economy
apartments.
“The decision was made in the best
interest of the students," Michael Schultz,
director of housing, said.
Schultz assured students that the
renovations will eventually occur and
apologized
for
the
continued
inconvenience.
“I’d like to apologize because the
expectations were set and we had to go
back on the expectations,” Schultz said.
Schultz further explained that the

healthy job market for contractors and
construction is what led to some of the
problems in trying to attract bids for
Phase I of the housing renovations.
According to Schultz, the Phase I
housing renovations project was broken
up into 25 separate bid packages. Seven
of them received no bids, another seven
received only one bid, and 11 had
multiple bids. Out of those 18 bid
packages received, some contractors did
not qualify. Also, out of all the bids

received all were $2.3 million over the
original estimate.
Housing also had problems with the
bid specifications for the windows and
bathrooms. The original Phase I plan also
was intended to have shift work as well,
but Schultz explained that housing had
received some feedback saying that shift
work might not be possible.
see VILLAGE, page 2

“Everything, from ants, to roaches to
everything,” SIUE sophomore, Tracey Thomas
said, about what is living in her apartment besides
her, on the 400 side of Cougar Village Apartments.
Thomas wasn't just a little disappointed by the
recent cancellation of the Phase I renovations in
Cougar Village. She, like many other students,
wondered why the renovations were cancelled and
when their apartment woes would ever be solved.
“Raggedy” appeared to be the word of choice
for many students describing the apartments. Most
are badly in need of some type of repair. Thomas is
one of the many residents in Cougar Village who
complain about the clogged garbage disposals and
the broken cabinets. Cougar Village may have
received a new name, but the contents of it didn’t
change with the moniker.
“We applied for these tom up apartments
expecting something,” freshman, Dwayne Bess
said. “We expected the highest and we got
the worst.”
Bess said that he was surprised by the
cancellation as he was looking forward to moving
out of Woodland Hall to live in Cougar Village.
Director of Housing Michael Schultz held two
open forums yesterday on the issue for students to
express their views. None attended the first one at
noon. The second at 7 p.m. was after the Alestle
went to press.

“Cougar Village renovation is a com plicated
renovation,” Schultz said. He said that renovations
will still take place, but not until summer of 1999.
Not all
students
were angered
by
the
cancellations. Some looked at things on the bright side,

“We figured the best thing to do was to
pull the plug right now and try again next
year,” Schultz said.
Schultz also cited the favorable
construction market as having a lot to do
with the bidding problems. Schultz called
it a “supply and demand” issue, with the
local contractors feeling the boom of a
growing economy.
But the letters and explanations didn’t
give much comfort to most students, as many

remarking that at least without having to pay the extra
price for the renovated apartment, they could save their
m oney for more im portant things. For freshman
psychology major, Aba Mensah, a new car sounded a lot
better than a renovated apartment.
“W hy would you want to get a renovated apartment
next August when they’re all going to be renovated
anyway?” Mensah said.
Mensah went on to explain that she and many other

were looking forward to the new renovations.
“For me, it really doesn’t affect me
because I’ll be an RA (resident assistant) but
all the apartments need to be renovated
because they’re raggedy,” Kelley Jones, a
junior majoring in sociology employment
relations, said. “They’re supposed to be
giving us incentives to live on campus.”
Many other students shared Jones’
sentiment. With the new phone system and
the change in charging for calls outside of
campus, many students are considering living
off campus.
Schultz still wants to assure students that

students weren’t angry at all about the cancellation.
“We’re not upset,” Mensah said. “Just fix the raggedy
roads because it’s messing up people’s cars.”
Many students agreed with this, hoping that the
cancellation wouldn’t keep current improvements with
parking and the roads from become a reality, but Schultz
assured that cancelled renovations will not affect the rest
of Cougar Village’s current repairs.

the renovations will occur. He also said that
not all improvements will be postponed. The
replacement of air conditioning units on the
400 side of Cougar Village will still continue.
The Cougar Lake Drive and parking will be
repaved and finished, and phone lines will be
switched over.
According to Schultz, the biggest
complaint he has received so far is with the
issue of the data jacks that were to be placed
in the renovated apartments. The jacks would
allow for internet access for apartments with
personal computers. For students who see
this as a necessity, Schultz said that there are

April 28, 1998

Residents of SIUE University Housing,
As most of you are aware, a major renovation project was scheduled to begin this summer at the apartments of Cougar Village.
This ambitious project will, upon its completion, bring the apartments up to the same high standards as our other housing
facilities, Prairie and Woodland Residence Halls. However, due to unfavorable bidding conditions and considerable
doubt that Phase I would not be completed by August 1998, the project must necessarily be delayed for one year.
Rather than risk inconveniencing residents with apartments that were not completed for Fall Semester, University officials
reluctantly decided to delay the project until the Summer of 1999. SIUE is fully committed to upgrading the facilities at Cougar
Village and will begin the project as scheduled next summer.
What does this mean to you? All apartments at Cougar Village will remain at the Economy rate next year - $994 per semester
for a shared bedroom, $1477 per semester for a private bedroom, and $1988 per semester for a deluxe private bedroom.
Summer moves will be limited only to those whose Fall assignments are different than their current assignments. Residents will
be notified when they can move into their Fall assignments. The University Housing Reservation Process will not be repeated,
but current residents may go in to the Central Housing Office (0248 Rendleman Hall) before June 1 if they wish to move into
another available space.
One scheduled renovation project will occur during the summer: replacement of the 400 side air conditioning units. This will
assure residents of a comfortable and cool summer in Cougar Village.
The telephone prefix change (650) will also occur as scheduled over Memorial Day weekend; however, personal telephone
lines and computer data jacks will not be available to Cougar Village residents until apartment renovations are completed.
Residents who desire these services are encouraged to consider choosing Woodland Hall. With these communication services,
the 24-hour computer lab, and the exciting new Focused Interest Communities (FICs), Woodland Hall can be a great alternative
to apartment-style living. Residents wishing to change their reservation from Cougar Village to Woodland Hall should go to the
Central Housing Office to complete the necessary paperwork.
Students who have questions about the changes in the renovation project are encouraged to attend one of two Open Forums
with the Director o f Housing. Both will be held in the Cougar Village Commons Building this Wednesday, April 29, at
noon and 7pm. You can also ask questions by E-mail. E-mail your questions to lmckirg@ siue.edu. Questions will be
responded to on the Cougar Village and Woodland Hall listservs, so all residents may view the answers.
The entire University community is aware of the inconvenience this change will cause some of you, and for that we are truly
sorry. It is our mission to provide our students with the best housing available at the most reasonable cost. The well-being of
our students comes first, which is why the decision to delay the project had to be made.
We pledge that we will do everything possible to ensure that the renovation project at Cougar Village will occur beginning next
summer and that those renovations will live up to your expectations.

Sincerely,

Michael Schultz
Director of University Housing

data jacks in Woodland Hall, and that
students can apply for space there since there
is still room for students.
When renovations finally occur in the
summer of 1999, apartment improvements
will be as follows:
- totally renovated kitchens and
bathrooms, including new cabinets, fixtures
and appliances
- some new furniture
- replacement of windows and sliding
glass doors
- balcony replacement on the 400 side
- data jacks to connect personal
computers to the campus network
- floor replacement on the 500 side
- new siding on building exteriors
- improved drainage systems on
complex grounds.
An open forum to answer questions
about the current housing situation
and construction was held at noon
Wednesday with a second one held at
7 p.m. No students attended the noon
meeting, but Schultz urges students to
ask any questions they may have
about
their
housing
situations.

Police describe man accused of giving son HIV as a drifter
ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) —
The man accused of giving his
son HIV has been a drifter all of
his life, police say.
Brian Stewart is charged
with first-degree assault. He has
pleaded innocent.
Prosecutors allege that he
injected his infant son with
HIV-tainted blood six years ago
to avoid paying child support.
Now the 7-year-old boy has full­
blown AIDS.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch
on Sunday quoted unidentified
police sources as saying Stewart

was a drifter who would move to
town, build a new life and then
move on when he had worn out
his welcome.
“He’s moved several times whenever the girlfriends got tired
of him ,” one police source said.
Police have said Stewart has
used other nam es, including
Brian Eugene Simonin, and that
he has listed various addresses in
recent years in St. Louis, St.
Charles, Troy and Moscow Mills.
Stewart, 31, was living in
Colum bia, 111., when he was
arrested last Tuesday.

His nomadic lifestyle began
in childhood. He was bom in
Alton, 111., but the family moved
often as his father was in the
Army. Stewart returned to Alton
to attend high school.
He took courses at St. Louis
Community
C ollege
in
phlebotomy, the taking of blood
for testing, and received a
certificate of proficiency.
He was a member of the
Naval Reserves and served some
of his active duty at Great Lakes

Chicago in late 1992, police said.

SEATTLE (AP) — Bounty
hunters who w anted to take

have raised a w hite flag.
The B ritish agent for

of it bad.

“I’m very concerned about

of the crim inal record of his

B ritish new spapers have

convicted of causing grievous

a 150,000-volt stun gun.
M ahalko said O liver had a

how Oliver got them.

who impounds cars part time in

He has said he now makes his

Firefighter’s tattoo becomes part of
M&M’s hype for the new millennium
DAYTONA BEA CH , Fla.
(AP) — By all accounts, John
Capers is a fine firefighter. But
it isn’t his prow ess at putting
out fires that has earned him the
title F irefig h ter o f the New
M illennium . I t’s his love for —
som e say add ictio n to — a
certain chocolate co n fectio n
that m elts in your m outh, not in
your hand.
A fter responding to a m inor
blaze on a recent m orning,
Capers became a celebrity of
sorts w hen a crew from
M & M /M ars
d escen d ed
on
Daytona B each Firehouse No. 1
to
m ake
the
37-year-old
firefighter a star.
W ell, m aybe not a star,
exactly. But he and his rather
unusual tattoo were captured on
video tape that w ill be used in
connection w ith the candy
com p an y ’s
to n g u e-in -ch eek
M illennium Hype advertising
campaign.
N ot only is C apers the
official Firefighter of the New
M illennium , the tattoo on his

extrem ely m uscular left forearm
has also been proclaim ed tattoo
o f the New M illennium by
M & M ’s Center for M illennium
Hype. The fact that it features a
dashing green M&M firefighter
holding a fire ax and standing
next to a yellow fire hydrant
may have had som ething to do
with the selection.
Capers, who adm its to a
“pack-a-day” habit — and more
when he can get them — has
been hooked on the plain
chocolate candies (he only eats
the peanut ones in a pinch)
“ever since I was a k id.” The
extra calories haven’t been a
problem , he said, since he
regularly works out.
I ’m ju s t glad it finally
paid o ff,” said his w ife,
C hristine, who cam e to the
firehouse to jo in in the hype
along with C apers’ tw o teen-age
sons — who are also heavily
into M&Ms.
Capers has been collecting
M&M
m em orabilia
figurines, dispensers and other

collectibles — alm ost as long
as h e’s been eating the candy.
And it was his fondness for
his favorite snack that prom pted
him to get his M & M tattoo
almost two years ago — while
m unching
on
the
m ulti­
colored sweets to ease the pain,
o f course.
So
he
fig u red
that,
considering
his
obvious
devotion, he m ight have a
chance to w in som ething in
M & M ’s “Official Things of the
New M illen n iu m ” contest.
F irefig h ter and tatto o w ere
am ong the 200 categories,
along w ith ev ery th in g from
belly button and barbecue king
to couch potato and bank
m achine. To in crease his
chances, Capers entered in six
categories, including welcome
mat, which he also won.
But it w a sn ’t dream s
o f fam e or glory or big
prizes that prom pted him to
fill
out
all
those
entry
blanks, w rite 50-w ord essays
and send in snapshots of

him self and his tattoo.
“I ju st w anted to win
som ething,” he said. W hich is a
good thing, since all he gets are
some official certificates, Tshirts, lots o f free M&Ms, and
the chance to win a trip to an
MTV awards show.
Karen
Freid,
w ho’s
handling public relations for the
M & M ’s M illennium campaign,
said she didn’t know how many
firefighters or tattoos Capers
had to compete against to get
his titles. Overall, the company
received m ore than 13,000
subm issions. She did say,
however, that he is one of only
eight who w ere chosen to
appear in prom otional videos
that will be shown as part of a
national advertising campaign.
W hether Capers w ill end up in
actual TV com m ercials, she
couldn’t predict.
Fellow
firefighters,
meanwhile, are well aware of
C apers’ cravings.
“He can’t go w ithout them

There comes a time when
everything must be let go,
even if letting it go is gutwrenchingly painful.
I’m talking about the end of
“Seinfeld,” the greatest
television show to ever grace the
airwaves. I’m already planning
my withdrawal.
Like Ewan McGreggor in
“Trainspotting,” I’m going to
lock myself in a room with about
25 cans of beans, a TV, VCR and
my memories. It’ll be hell.
Lately, though, I haven't
appreciated “Seinfeld” like I
used to. Back in high school, a
whole group o f us would get
together on Thursday nights to
revel in the greatness. We would
spout off lines like, “Are those
the panties your mother laid out
for you?” And I would
sympathize with the crabby,
greedy, stout, bald man. I knew
George Costanza. I was George
Costanza. This was 1993, and
the world was still full of wonder
and promise.
But, for the last couple of
seasons, I have been a little
busier. I still try not to miss an
episode, but I usually watch
them on videotape late at night.
I blame m yself for Jerry
wanting to call it quits. You all
can blame me as well. But, I will
defend the show to my death. I
say, “poo poo” to all those who
claim the show isn’t as funny as
it used to be. I hope you’re all
happy. What are we left with
now? “Drew Carrey”? The
"Friends”? “Frasier”? Amateurs.
They don’t even come close.
So, come May 14, when the
last “Yada yada,” “Get out!” and
“Not that there’s anything wrong
with that" are uttered; when the
bulk of America is saying, “That
was no M*A*S*H*” ; when Jerry
Seinfeld is lying drunk on a big
pile of money; I will be alone in
the dark, weeping silently, and
shouting, “Serenity now!
Serenity now!” Sleep well.

For the last two years, Danny
Woodburn has been tussling and
grappling with Michael Richards’
Kramer on “Seinfeld.” When the
show ends in two weeks,
Woodburn may or may not make
a cameo appearance as Mickey,
the high strung actor.

NOTHING BUT NET
Denzel Washington and
R ay Allen star in the new
Spike Lee bask etba ll
drama, “He G ot Game. ”

■ BY JA SO N T R IP L E T T
l.IFF.STYLF REPORTER
Spike Lee’s latest work from Touchstone
Pictures, “He Got Game,” tells the story of a
high school basketball prodigy from Coney
Island. Ray Allen, of the NBA’s Milwaukee
Bucks, plays Jesus Shuttlesworth, a kid who
has the weight of the world on his shoulders,
due to the life decisions he has to make about
college, basketball and his family.
Denzel Washington plays Jesus’ father, a
convicted murderer who, at the beginning of
the story, is serving a sentence for the murder
of his wife. Washington’s character is granted

leave and a possible early
release from his sentence if he can get his son
to play for the state university’s team.
This film not only captures the business of
basketball, but also lets the viewer walk in the
shoes of a basketball star and see the tough
decisions that need to be made by an athlete
at such a young age. Jesus needs guidance
from his father, but won’t let himself open up
to the man who taught him the game and also
killed his mother.
Cameos, from such NBA talent as the
Pacer’s Travis Best and the Knick’s John
Wallace add to the basketball feel. Plus,
appearances from every other basketball

mind in the game supports the point of the
movie. You have to take into account that
some of them are not actors, they’re
basketball players or analysts and really need
work in the drama department. But Lee
illustrates the transition from the game of
basketball to the business o f basketball
exceptionally well.
This movie could easily have blown up
into another “Above the Rim” or “Blue
Chips,” but Lee takes the player out of
basketball and put him into the game of life
with basketball as his tedious meal ticket. The
only way for Jesus to make it through this
trial is to become a business man marketing
himself, or let people he doesn’t trust decide
what he is going to do.
This movie leaves you w ith hew
knowledge about a subject some people know
little about; life outside the spotlight for
athletes. The film informs you to the point of
saying “OK, maybe basketball can be a job” ;
but, it keeps the glory for the end and still
makes me want to pick up a ball and play.

Red-hot Cougar baseball loses after nine-game victory streak
■ BY TO N Y A M M A N N
SPORTS REPORTER
M other N ature may have
decided to m ake it rain all
week, but it still cou ld n ’t cool
off the red-hot Cougars.
While the weather has often
been gray, wet, cold and dreary
this spring, SIUE baseball has
been nothing close to that. In fact,
it’s about the only thing El Nino
has yet to destroy.
In their past ten games, only
one team has been able to rain on
the Cougar parade. On Sunday,
the University of Southern
Indiana gave the Cougars a dose
of their own medicine as SIUE

was blanked 6-0 at US1.
The Cougars are best known
for their uncanny ability to flashflood opponents with runs.
However, Sunday’s game marked
the first time all season that SIUE
has been shut out.
“It’s hard to win every game,”
Cougar coach Gary Collins said.
“Their pitcher had a really good
game. We just didn’t respond.”
The loss on Sunday came one
day after the Cougars won a
dramatic game at home against
the same USI squad. Senior
outfielder Mark Briggs hit a
home run in the tenth inning to
close out the SIUE home
schedule for 1998.

“It’s easy to get down when
you win a game like the one on
Saturday,” Collins said. “It was
really special because it was
the last home gam e o f his
[Briggs’] career.”
However, Briggs is not the
only Cougar threat at the plate.
1997 NCAA D ivision II AllAmericans on the SIUE roster
include
shortstop
Mike
Robertson and pitcher Ryan Cox.
Robertson leads the team with
eleven home runs and 56 RBIs.
He is also in the race for the best
batting average on the team with
an impressive .406 clip. Cox has
compiled a 6-1 record and has
struck out three batters for every

one he has walked.
A large num ber o f C ougars
made a bid for A ll-A m erican
honors for 1998 as w ell. To
nam e a few : Jaso n S ie v ert
and Jesse Bugger, w ho have
batting averages above .400.
B riggs
and
S e n io r
R ob
L aM arsh have each hit ten
hom e runs. L aM arsh has also
driven in 46 runs and has a
perfect record on the m ound
at 8-0.
The Cougars seem to be
playing their best ball of the
season. Their recent nine-game
winning streak was their longest
this year.
“We have improved a little

bit,” Collins said. “We have a set
lineup every game.”
Team chemistry can play an
important role heading into the
last few weeks of the season in
any sport. The Cougar players
have that working for them along
with their big bats.
“Our chem istry has been
pretty good,” Collins said.
“We’ve gotten used to each other.
Everyone seems to get along.
Sometimes chem istry can be
overrated.”
Of course, when your team
has eleven players hitting better
than .300 and your record is 31 10, you would have to be insane
to not get along.

Cougar softball w aiting for w ord on possible post season regionals bid
■ BY B R E T T LICATA

Hitting has been the Cougars’ strong suit all season
long. Head coach Sandy Montgomery always reiterates
the fact that if her team hits well, they will win ball games.
Freshman Sarah Sollberger has led SIUE in hitting all
season long. Her 12 home runs set a new single season
home run mark at SIUE. Sollberger has not only added
power into the Cougar lineup, but also consistency. She
leads the team with 56 RBIs and a .410 batting average.
Sollberger was also named MVP of the Great Lakes
Valley Conference Tournament two weeks ago.
Gw en Jackson has been on a base stealing terro r
in her sen io r season. Jackson has sw iped 35 o f 38
this season and has the second b est battin g average
on the squad at .375.
Dupo native Mandy Uhrhan has come on strong in her
first collegiate season. She has collected an RBI total of
38 and is batting .341 after starting every game for SIUE.
Junior Niki M itts’ seven homers places her second on
the team in that category. Her latest came in last
weekend’s game against Grand Valley State University

SPORTS REPORTER
Is a record of 36-21 good enough for a post season bid?
We’ll find out Sunday.
It’s been a season of unexpected success for the SIUE
softball team. After losing seven players from last year’s
starting lineup, the Cougars were supposed to have a
rebuilding year. With a chance to advance to regionals,
this team is anything but rebuilding.
Sunday will be judgm ent day for SIUE as the selection
committee will either award or deny the Cougars a spot in
the regional tournament.
Yesterday’s rain-out of a doubleheader with Southern
Illinois University-Carbondale left the Cougars with two
less games to prove they have what it takes to play in the
post season.
SIUE is coming off a road trip to Joliet last weekend
where they lost three of five, but were able to upset the
no. 4 team in the nation, Ashland University.

when she also added three RBIs to her total of 22 on the
year.
The hero of last weekend’s upset of Ashland, Kim
Messinger, has picked up her game as of late, raising her
batting average to .365. Her two-run home run to beat
Ashland glorifies the fact that she is one of the best clutch
hitters on the team.
A good hitting team won’t get far without a staff of
quality hurlers. SIUE’s stellar pitching duo of Jessica
Silbe and Deanna Smith has found a way to tame some of
Division II’s most potent offensive teams.
Silbe has a record of 15-10 with a team-best 1.95 ERA.
A 7-0 win over Northwood University last Saturday was
her fourth shutout of the season. Her 61 strikeouts also
leads the team.
Deanna Smith has a 2.20 ERA in her senior season.
She has only given up one home run this season in over
130 innings pitched. Smith recorded her 12th victory of
the year in the win over Ashland and is second among
SIUE pitchers in strikeouts with 51.

Sports Column: Cougar spo rts draw ing to close, so is spo rts section
■ BY SARAH FINLEY
SPORTS REPORTF.R
As the Cougars’ season draws
to a close, so does my job.
Over the summer, the Cougars
lie dormant and come back in the
fall full-force, and so do I.
I have had the tim e of my
life w orking for this paper. I
never expected the resu lts I
have gotten.

I have been able to watch the
teams of the school I attend prove
to everyone what real sports are.
F ro m
b a s e b a ll
to
v o lle y b a ll, th is is the b e st
season I have w itn essed .
I give it to the athletes,
because without them my job
would be nonexistent. The
coaches also deserve praise for
the effort they have had to put
forth to mold the young athletes

of this school.
I would also like to thank
Sports Information Director Eric
Hess for helping me out when I
have been a little short.
I would like to thank my
reporters, because with out them
there wouldn’t have been such
extensive coverage o f the sports
on this campus..
I would like to thank the
athletes and coaches that took

and I can’t wait until fall.
Next semester, I am going to
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity that I have to watch
the Cougars in action.
Once again, thank you to
everybody who helped me with
this section. Without that help,
this section probably would
have been lost, right along side
my mind.
Thank you, have a great
summer and see you in the fall.
Go Cougars!

time out of their busy schedules
to talk to us about their
accom plishm ents.
I
ca n ’t
forget
the
photographers that captured the
great feats o f the athletes for
the paper.
And most of all, I would like
to thank the people who make
this job possible. Without the
students this paper would be just
another publication that goes by
the wayside.
This semester was awesome,
