Assistant to Chancellor Belck dies
By Darryl Hewlett
News Editor
Last Thursday, the SIUE community lost a dedicated
employee in William Gardner. Gardner, 56, died from
complications of a stroke that he suffered two weeks ago.
Gardner served as assistant to the Chancellor of Southern
Illinois University at Edwardsville since September of 1989.
His death came as a shock to the university.
“His death is a deep loss to the university,” Wilma Jene
Bond, executive secretary to the Chancellor, said. “He was a
very, very committed man. I worked with him each day since
he started working for the Chancellor. It’s been hard to adjust.
He had a big sense of what the university was about. It’s hard
William Gardner
to lose somebody like that.”
In a telephone conversation from her home, G ardner’s wife,
Carol, reflected on G ardner’s commitment to the university and the energy he
gave.

Cougar Den to take on
new and improved look

“He liked working with people, helping people. He really
believed strongly in the university—that was very important to him.
He had many friends,” Carol Gardner said.
Carol Gardner said Working at a place he enjoyed since 1969
made him eager to come to work each morning.
Chancellor Belck also commented on the grief that will be felt
by G ardner’s death.
“I think we will all feel Bill’s loss. Did you know while cleaning
out his desk, I found over 75 letters of thanks from students,” Belck
said. “I also remember how helpful he was to many of the students.”
Belck also noted that Gardner was a liaison aijd area contact
between state legislators concerning the kind of funding the
university would receive from the state.
“Bill was a very good local resource. Along with his problem­
solving abilities, he had a wonderful sense of humor. He will be
sorely missed,” Belck said.

Engineering student
wins regional ASME
design contest
By Ty Norris
News Reporter
SIUE has done it again.
M aintaining a tradition of excellence, Todd Douglas
Hickman, a senior majoring in Mechanical Engineering, won
First Place in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME) Regional Design Contest (Region VII, Southern
Tier). This marks the second consecutive year that a
mechanical engineering student from SIUE has won the award.
Last year, R obert Arcykiewicz, a recent mechanical
engineering graduate, won the award.
“I feel proud to represent my school,” Hickman said.
Hickman, who is a senior and will graduate in the fall of
1997, said it took awhile to construct his winning design.
“It took me six months to complete the design,” Hickman
said.

Workers continue renovations to the Cougar Den. The project w ill be completed June 28.

By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
University C enter’s Cougar Den is
currently undergoing major renovations this
summer. The renovations, which started on
May 6, should be completed by June 28.
Assistant University Center Director Lyle
Ward described the changes that will take
place.
“The purpose for the renovations is to
upgrade the dining and seating area. It will
look very much like Center Court when
finished. It will also have the same kind of
lighting configuration as Center Court,”
Ward said.
Included in the renovations is the
demolition of the wall that divided the

Cougar Den into two parts. With the
removal of the wall, a larger space can be
used for parties and other social gatherings.
“We wanted to open up space for dances.
That was a major goal of ours," Ward said.
Lisa Pillsbury, assistant director of
Campus Life agreed.
“It will provide additional programming
space for students and organizations for late
night events,” Pillsbury said. “Hopefully to
better meet their needs to expand their
capacities—for additional people to attend
dances.”
Other changes in store for Cougar Den
are a new walkway and using the west doors
as an entrance and exit for late-night events.

Supreme Court rules for gay rights
• The U.S. Suprem e Court ruled
M onday in favor of gay rights as it
struck down a Colorado m easure it said would deny homosexuals
constitutional protection and make them “unequal to everyone else.”
This was the first m ajor ruling involving gay rights since a 1986
decision in which the justices upheld a G eorgia law that criminalized
homosexual sex betw een consenting adults.

Taiwan president Teng-hui offers to end 47 years of hostility
• Taipei Taiwan— Newly sworn-in President Lee Teng-hui offered
to end 47 years of hostility betw een Taiwan and China. Teng-hui’s
rem arks were received with flag-waving and roars of approval from
the crowd of 50,000 people packing his inauguration.

Surgical patient infected with AIDS turned away by AIDS facility
• Tokyo— A hospital designated as an official A ID S facility turned
away a surgical patient infected with the virus that causes the deadly
disease, Japanese reports said Monday.
Officials confirm ed that an unidentified patient at the Haga Red
Cross H ospital in M akoa, 60 miles north of Tokyo, was sent
elsewhere for an em ergency gallstone operation last summer. The
hospital staff had given the patient painkillers and sent him home
twice the week before.
G overnm ent health officials said the hospital was not prepared to
handle such patients four m onths after it was designated a treatm ent
center for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

Turtle village slows traffic in St. Louis
• A 40-foot-long snapping turtle is rising up from the
earth at Forest Park. It’s being joined by a red-eared
slider, a soft-shelled turtle, a box turtle, a Mississippi map
turtle and a seventh species not yet selected.
R obert Cassilly is sculpting the giant concrete turtles for
a children’s playground. The turtle village has been
causing traffic snarls along nearby Highway 40 as drivers
slow to look at the village.
Illinois Senate passes bill naming road for Reagan
• Form er President Ronald R eagan’s roots in Illinois
may become m ore cem ented—literally.
A resolution sponsored by Sen. W alter Dudyez, RChicago, would change U.S. 14 to Ronald Reagan
Highway. The route is located northwest of Chicago,
connecting the city with Wisconsin.
The resolution passed the Senate overwhelmingly
M onday but still needs H ouse approval.
The highway title is com memorative only, so
municipalities will not have to alter road signs or change
the various titles U.S. 14 now has. Signs posted at each
end of the highway— in Chicago and at the Illinois and
Wisconsin border—will designate the roadway as Ronald
Reagan Highway.

A l e s i l e

commentary

“These are
the
times
that
try
m e n ’ s
souls,” is a
f a mous
quote given
by Thomas
P a i n e
during the
campaign of
o
u
r
Ame r i c an
independence. Paine was addressing the
colonists to gather support for the cause. Over
two hundred years later, this same feeling of
support must be encouraged by our college
political organizations on the SIUE campus.
With the start of the summer term, now is
the time to get out the word to vote for
whichever candidate is worthy to be elected.
The College Democrats, College Republicans
and other political groups must inform the
students on the issues and problems that our
local, state and national governments are
facing. And on that note, an outlet that these
organizations can use is the campus
newspaper.
It shocked me to learn that over the past
school year, both groups have not used the
paper a* frequently as I think they should. The
times when the paper was used included an
October 12,1995 Alestle letter to the editor by
Scott Mills, National committeeman for Young
Democrats of Illinois entitled “Democratic
Senators Still Fighting the Good Fight.”
Other times included an ongoing debate
between Michael W. Flota, president of the
Democratic Socialists of America, SIUE Youth
Chapter and Matt Gross, president of the
SIUE College Republicans, which ran by way
of letters to the editor from April 2 to the end
of the spring semester. Thanks to their letters,
some college students as well as faculty and
staff were given a topic to ponder and discuss.
The only problem with the letters was that they
concentrated only on the economic issue. Why
not expand to include all issues that affect not
only college students but other Americans as
well. There are still a lot of citizens who are
undecided on who to vote for and a great deal
are students.
With issues such as affirmative action,
financial aid, student loans and education
grants, the campus political organizations
should not allow other media outlets to be the
only source of the credentials of a candidate.
The newspaper could drastically improve
students impressions and opinions on
candidates from Bob Dole to President
Clinton to Ross Perot. Honestly, can the
average college students say they know what
each candidate stands for? Or better yet, do
they really care? If students are achieving a
higher education it should be one of their goals
in life to help elect officials and campus
political organizations that can inform better.

there
many undecided voters, there are many
unregistered voters who may need your
encouragment in order to become registered.
This is an opportunity to say to our citizens
that their vote does make a difference and they
will only make a difference if they vote.
Also, not only must our political groups do
their part, but the average college student as
well. If you believe strongly for or against a
candidate make it known why. Everyone does
not listen to a candidate, college political group
or the press. However, chances are people will
rely on a friend’s or colleague’s thoughtful
insight of a candidate.
The opportunity that is currently presenting
itself before these political organizations is to
write once a week on an issue and put it into
the Alestle. Each week could have a different
issue and a chance for both Republicans and
Democrats and other organizations to give
insight.
So, with all this in mind, the Alestle will do
its part to inform readers of the candidates and
the issues. Shouldn’t our college’s political
organizations do the same?

Arrest
On May 10, 1996, at 2:37 a.m., officers arrested Garry
Wayne Shryock, 44, of East Alton. He was arrested for
obstructing justice, no valid driver’s license and no driver’s
license on person. Mr. Shryock was given a Notice to
A ppear and released. His vehicle was towed by Cross
Towing.

On May 11, 1996, at 12:17 a.m., officers arrested Craig
Nelson, 37, of Granite City. He was arrested for DUI, DUI
over .10 and improper lane usage. Cross Towing towed his
vehicle. Mr. Nelson posted $102 bond and was released.

On May 12, 1996, at 2:24 a.m., officers responded to Tower
Lake Apartm ents in reference to a disturbance. John D.
McDonough, 20, of Edwardsville, was arrested for battery.
He posted $102 bond and was released.

Criminal Damage to Property

Restrooms will also be installed inside the Cougar Den. The facility will, however, decrease in
capacity for dining from 170 to 150.
The expansion of the space for dances sits well with members of the Greek community.
“It’s great. It’s wonderful. I feel it will benefit the University Center. It will benefit the Greek
community—which is expanding —to make more room for Greek functions,” Stacey Keith,
member of Sigma Gamma Rho, said.
The current maximum attendance for dances is 200. At the present time, no figure has been
given for the increase in attendance at dances that will come with the additional space. The
University Center will not have that information until the renovations are completed.
Ward also commented on the estimated cost of the current project.
“The cost of the renovations are allocated from the University Center’s annual building
account. The project will cost an estimated $50,000,” Ward said. “(Cougar Den) will have all new
tables and the tables will be repaired and refurnished.”
The completion of the Cougar Den will end a two-year project which has also seen the
renovations of Center Court in August of 1994 and the University Restaurant over the Christmas
break of 1995-1996. Ward said there are no additional plans for changes in the dining area.
Cougar Den will be open for various functions after July 1, including serving a number of
summer camps that will meet on campus. The facility will be open for students and faculty this fall.

Robert Fleming (seated), of Alton, shares with his parents, Audrey and Milan Fleming and
his sister, Kim, the certificate of recognition he received recently from the University Center
Board (UCB) at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville.

By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
When Robert Fleming was 20, his life was
irrevocably changed.
It was in 1970 and Fleming was an airplane
mechanic in Vietnam. He began experiencing
headaches, loss of vision and had trouble
walking. What his superiors initially passed off

as excuses to get out of work turned out to be
a brain tumor.
Fleming was airlifted out to Wright
Patterson Medical Center in Ohio where he
underwent an operation. The Center was his
home for the next eleven months while he
“relearned everything all over again,” he said,
with the help of physical, occupational and
speech therapists.

That was the first of three brain tumors
he’s had. His experience, he said, has led him
to become an advocate for the disabled.
“I noticed people with disabilities, but
never saw how unfairly they were treated
until I became disabled myself. That’s why
I’m such an advocate,” Fleming said.
Fleming graduated last December with a
bachelor’s in psychology. He was past
president of New Horizon’s, an organization
for students with disabilities and a member of
the Americans with Disabilities Act
compliance advisory committee at the
university. In addition, he serves on the board
at IMPACT, an advocacy organization in
Alton.
Recently, Fleming received a certificate of
recognition from the University Center Board
for his efforts to provide access at the
university for persons with disabilities. In the
past, he has received the Rehabilitation
Community Award from the Illinois Dept, of
Rehabilitation.
The ramps you see in the bowling alley and
in the Goshen Lounge are the result of
Fleming’s efforts. When the cafeteria was
renovated about two years ago, Fleming went
over the blueprints with the architect to make
sure the changes were up to A D A standards.
Fleming said it’s often the little changes
that make life easier for people with

disabilities—a lower stack of trays; the
counter behind the cashiers so a wheelchair
can be rolled up to it; a press bar under the
ice dispenser that can be manipulated with
one hand.
“Lyle Ward has been a great help,”
Fleming said. “Without his help I don’t think
I could’ve done it. If I had a complaint, I
could go to him and he would work with me.”
Once a participant in sports—baseball,
basketball, football— Fleming now can only
watch them. So he’s turned his attention to a
new hobby, photography, which he usés in his
advocacy work.
Fleming plans to continue his advocacy
work and in fact had a trip to Springfield. II.
the day he was interviewed.
“I ’m meeting with a coalition of citizens
with disabilities and we hope to be able to
talk to some legislators,” he said.
About three months ago, Fleming
underwent another round of radiation
treatment for his third brain tumor, receiving
15 doses of radiation five minutes apart. The
medical technology that enabled doctors to
aim the radiation to a specific spot in his
brain was unavailable just 11 years ago when
a second tumor was discovered.
But, he said, “you’d be surprised what the
human body can endure—a lot of pain and
stress.”

His hard work and dedication paid off. He
was able to secure first place.
“I felt relieved and incredible,” Hickman
said.
According to Dr. X. Terry Yan, assistant
professor of mechanical engineering and local
ASME faculty advisor, each year a design
problem is proposed by the ASM E to
mechanical engineering students all over the
nation. This year’s design problem was to
simulate the transportation of hazardous
liquids from a factory collection point to a
disposal point. The problem is to transport 8
oz. of water between two identical containers
79 inches apart.
“Todd’s design was called an elevated dump
system,” Yan said. “His system raises the
collection container to an elevated level and
dumps the liquid into a drainage pipe which
leads to the disposal container, letting gravity
do the work.
“The ASME is one of the oldest and largest

societies in America. It is very large and
promotes development within the mechanical
engineering field,” Yan said.
The ASME is divided into 12 regions, with
each region holding a separate competition.
First place winners of each region then
advance to the National Design Contest.
Hickman was awarded $200 cash for his first
place finish in the regional contest. He also
received an all expense paid trip to Atlanta,
Georgia, to compete in the National Design
contest to be held November 17-23.
“I am happy to have the chance to go,”
Hickman said. “But, I’m not as nervous as I
was during the regional contest.”
A total of eight students participated in the
conference, the second largest number of
participants from a university. This gained the
university the Highest Percentage of Member
Award, given to a student section with the
most students attending.
“1 feel very proud,” Yan concluded.

RIBS___________________________________
from previous page

num ber one slot in the barbeque world. Recently rated by the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch as num ber two in the Metro East for its
barbeque grub, Red'z Rib Shack has carved quite a niche for
itself both in the world of good food and good service. And
the high quality food and service don't just happen by
accident. For Quick, they're essentials.
"We will do w hatever it takes," Quick said with a smile.
And "whatever it takes" starts with each and every one of
the 30 employees (including Quick and his wife) of Red'z Rib
Shack. Quick em phasized that all of his employees are
certified food sanitarians. Even the server that hands
customers their food is certified. Each employee is also
required to go to monthly customer service and food service
seminars. Each employee m ust also follow a checklist for
opening and closing procedures. They also m ust take tests
related to handling food, controlling bacteria and serving food
at the correct temperature.
"We cut corners nowhere," Quick said. "We do not or will
not ever compromise."
Quick's commitment to success and good quality can
definitely be tasted in his food. Just ask his customers. Quick
said that each of his managers try to introduce themselves to
customers while they're eating in the restaurant to see how
they are enjoying their food and the service. But the answer is
never "good."
Instead of "good", Quick said, the answer is "outstanding"
or the "best I've ever tasted."
And don't just take Quick's word for it. Just take a look at
his sales. In the past six days, he said, he has sold 8,000
pounds of meat. But during the summer, he said, he expects
that num ber to rise.
"We expect that num ber to go from 10,000 to 12,000. We'll
be doing a ton of meat a day," Quick said.
So as summer gets closer, Red'z Rib Shack prepares to fill
its building capacity of 150. But if it does get too crowded,
customers can always move out to the rock garden. And even
if it's not too crowded, the rock garden is the place to be for
Red'z fish boils.
"O ur fish boils are very unique," Quick said.
Red'z has two fish boils every Friday and Saturday at 7
p.m. and 8:30 p.m. The fish boil is a dinner show and
reservations m ust be made. During the show, two employees
dress up like pirates and boil white fillet haddock that is
shipped from Boston. And Quick puts as much effort into the
fish boils as he does his secret sauce.
"And on the weekends, I am Redbeard," he said with a
grin. "We boil the little kids if you bring them."
Quick's joking and easygoing attitude are just part of the
reason Red'z Rib Shack has enjoyed so m uch success. He
stressed that the dream is w hat m ade it such an overall
success. And he hasn't stopped dreaming. As a m atter of fact,
he's got his dream for life after Red'z Rib Shack.
"In two years, I see ourselves on the beach in the Caribbean
collecting shells and this is our means."
So what will happen to Red'z? Well, it will still be on the
same corner. Quick and his wife? Well, the Caribbean can't do
too bad with its own beachside rib shack.

Bif Naked, the best album you’ll never hear
By Lenon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
People sometimes ask me what it is like
to write music reviews for the paper. I tell
them that it has it’s ups and downs, but for
the most part it’s very enjoyable. The
downs are when I find new CDs in my
mailbox that are just plain awful. Sitting
through a whole album can at times be
very painful. Other times new artists come
through that are quite a pleasant surprise.
That is what makes the job so much fun.
Finding good new music is always a thrill
for me.
My latest surprise came when I received
the self-titled release by the artist named
Bif Naked. Naked is yet another woman to
come around in the female angst-rock
explosion that seems so popular today. The
break-through started gaining national
attention with Hole and Liz Phair and has
become mainstream with the success of a
Canadian-born woman whose name I
refuse to mention.
I do not want to compare Naked to that
certain Canadian for two reasons. The first
reason is that instead of dwelling on the
negative of life, Naked’s songs stress the
importance of strength and bettering
yourself as a person. Instead of seeking
revenge, the songs talk about moving on
with your life. The second reason is that
quite frankly, musically the songs are better
written.
At first glance, Naked looks like she
Summer is here, and
we’re all back for another
year long run at the paper.
This being the summer, you
should get ready for the
summer blockbusters
coming to a theater near
you.
Two of the big movies are
going to be “Twister” and
“Mission: Impossible”. Since
these movies will get much
media attention, I won’t
waste your time.
I
will instead talk, about
two smaller, art house
pictures that you need to
check out. The first picture
is “Welcome to the
Dollhouse”, winner of the
Grand Jury Prize at this
year's Sundance Film
Festival. The story is about
Dawn “Wiener Dog”
Wiener, a seventh grade
outcast dealing with the
cruelties of adolescence and
the taunts of classmates.
Anyone who has ever felt
alone or different should be
able to relate to Dawn’s
troubles.
The second picture is by
writer/director Jim
Jarmusch. The movie, titled
“Dead Man”, features
Johnny Depp as a city
businessman named William

should be an ex-member of Marilyn
Manson. She is heavily tattooed with an
evil looking scowl that might scare certain
small children. After reading the liner
notes and the lyrics, one learns that the
look is a look of pain. Pain is the building
block of this album. Pain is what Naked has
overcome to survive life up to this point.
The music inside reflects the trials and
turmoil experienced in her life.
Instead of a guaranteed radio-friendly
sound of “alternapop”, Naked has songs
that are a little more aggressive, being
almost reminiscent at times of heavy chord
bands such as Soundgarden or Seaweed
when they are at some of their tamer
moments. This not to say, however, that this
is a soft or tame album, because it’s not. To
use a term from the eighties, this woman
rocks!
Unfortunately, Naked is the latest of
many artists to receive the “Great Album
That You Will Probably Never H ear”
Award. The reason for this is not because
her songs won’t fit into commercial airplay,
because they will. The reason you may
never hear her is because she is on a very
small label. A station like the Point won’t
play her album because it doesn’t have the
financial backing like some of the other
bands on the playlist. This is a crime
because this is a very solid effort with a
strong message. Do yourself a favor and
hunt down this album. You may have to
order it, but it is definitely worth the wait.

going to be a busy summer.

(point*i*sen*chel) n. the
third in a series of 105.7 the
Point’s
unnecessary
&
horribly
redundant
collections of local music
from St. Louis, circa early1996
Pointessential Volume 1, a
compilation of local St.
Louis bands, came out in the
late months of 1994. The
album featured 19 songs by
both new and established
bands from around the area.
Not all of the songs were
good, but some were. It
showed that there are talented
musicians in the region, and it
left people waiting for the
next volume.
On Pointessential Volume 2,
the number of songs worth
listening to dropped down to
three. Those three were good,
but could be found elsewhere.
The
songs
by
Fragile
Porcelain Mice and the
Bottlerockets were already
available on full-length CDs,
and the song by the now
defunct Bionica was available
on their tape.
On the third installment,

Pointessential Volume 3, there
again are very few standouts.
Sourpatch and Nerve display
their talents well, while Son
Volt provides the album with
it’s best song, an acoustic
version of “D rown”. Three
songs out of eighteen is not a
good percentage.
These compilations do not
represent the best bands in St.
Louis. They represent the best
bands in St. Louis that the
Point will play. Even if a song
makes it to the album, there is
no guarantee that it will make
it on the air. “Tired” by

Bionica was one of the best
songs on the album, and one
of the best singles in 1995. It
had the potential to be a hit in
any market, but the station
rarely played it, opting to push
the station’s favorites, the
awful Great Big Everything.
The only real reason to buy
Volume 3 would be for the
Son Volt song. You decide if it
is worth $7 for one song. The
rest sound pretty much like
everything else on the Point.
If the albums keep getting
worse, I don’t want to hear the
next one.

During the break, while most students were
slacking off, coaches were busy trying to better
their squads.
On Friday May 10, men’s soccer and softball
teams helped themselves out by signing some
transfers from other colleges and in coming
freshmen.
Soccer Coach Ed Huneke went both
directions and signed two transfers and two
freshmen trying to improve on an injury
stricken 3-13-1 season.
The two transfers were senior Steve Van
Dyke from Eastern Illinois University and
junior Jason Maxfield who came from Wright
State University.
Van Dyke is a product of Collinsville High
School and spent three seasons at Eastern
where in 1994 he was named to the first team
All-Conference and a second team AllMidwest performer.
Huneke will use Van Dyke’s 6-foot-2-inch
frame as an explosive target up front.
“H e’ll be an immediate impact player as he
was the last three years at Eastern Illinois,”
Huneke noted.
The Cougars hope to see good minutes
from Maxfield, a former All-State and AllMidwest performer out of Granite City High
School.
“Jason is extremely fast and strong but with
an aggressiveness that leads to goals,” Huneke
said.
The other two signees are coming straight

into SIUE as freshmen. Andy Peck of Glenn
Carbon, was Edwardsville High School’s
Defensive Most Valuable Player since his
sophomore year. Peck also grabbed MVP
honors on the offensive side as a senior.
M attias Persson, of Shranor, Sweden,
figures to be a wing midfielder for the Cougars.
Huneke liked what he saw out of Persson at
the 1994 Dallas Cup.
“H e’s got very good speed and always
seems to be dangerous when he’s on the ball,”
Huneke said.
On the same day of May 10, softball signed
two players who should be very good assets to
the team.
Erica Connett of Peking is transferring to
SIUE from Illinois Central College as a third
baseman where she lead her team with a .438
batting average, 49 hits, 30 runs batted in, nine
triples and 16 walks.
“Erica is a very good hitter and a very
intense player,” Coach Sandy Montgomery
said. “She is their (ICC’s) top hitter, and she
will come in and make an impact immediately
because of her offensive capabilities.”
Sara Obrecht is the other player to sign on
and she is coming in with a youthful arm to add
to the pitching staff.
“Sara throws all the pitches, rise, drop,
change and curve. She is fighting a lower back
problem this year, but I think she will be an
asset for us,” Montgomery said.
The Cougars are trying to improve from an
13-8 second place conference mark and and
overall 34-17 record.

Softball places
three players on
All-Region team
From SIUE Sports Information
A trio of juniors from the SIUE
softball team were named to the
NCAA Division II All-Great Lakes
Region teams.
Junior Jennifer Smith, of
Collinsville, was selected to the first
team while juniors Kim Darrow, of
Washington, and Michele Sucich, of
Newark, were voted to the second
team.
Smith lead SIUE by hitting .417
with 68 hits, 14 doubles, six home
runs and 36 runs batted in. Her
performance was rewarded with an
All-GLVC selection, in which she
finished second in the Player of the
Year voting.
Deemed the “best defensive
catcher in the nation” by Head
Coach Sandy Montgomery, Darrow
committed only three errors in 201
chances for a fielding percentage of
.985. The Illinois Central College
transfer threw out 27 baserunners
in 48 attempts.
Hitting .338, Sucich was second
on the team with 46 hits, five
doubles, four triples and 30 RBIs.
She tied Smith for the lead in home
runs with six and was second for the
Cougars with 10 stolen bases. Like
Smith, Sucich was an All-GLVC
selection, coming in sixth in the
Player of the Year balloting.
