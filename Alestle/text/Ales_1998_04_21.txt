The event was an effort to

were over 25 vehicles which
included a cement truck, a semi, a

firetruck, a police car, a police

Parents as well as their

University of Connecticut to serve beer to legal age students at a weekend festival
STORRS, Conn. (AP) —
Looking to keep partying and
row diness under control, the
University of Connecticut will
serve beer on campus to students
21 and over during this w eek’s
spring weekend festivities.
In
recent
years,' the
celebration has been plagued
with off-campus trouble and
students driving and roam ing
through town after a day of
drinking.
“If you drive the party off
cam pus, you lose control,”

Participants
are
encouraged to get involved,
learn about other cultures and
try new things.
Jackson said that anyone
can attend and bring items
which reflect their cultural
backgrounds.
“Anyone interested in
attending Spring Family Fest is
encouraged to bring music,
crafts,
food
and
books
pertaining to their culture
background,” Jackson said.
For more inform ation,
please contact K.J. Jackson,
Family Housing Coordinator,
at 692-2900.

Chancellor Mark Emmert said.
The beer tent will be set up
in a fenced-in area of the football
field, with university security
officers
checking
' for
identification.
The university will sell 16ounce plastic cups o f beer to
those who can provide proof
that they are UConn students
and are at least 21 years old, the
legal drinking age. Each cup will
cost $1.50.
Proceeds from the beer sales
will go toward the cost of the

event, with any remaining profits
divided
among
student
organizations, said Thomas Q.
Callahan, UConn’s associate vice
president
for
institutional
advancement.
This year’s “U niversity
W eekend” celebration, which
begins Thursday, is only open to
UConn students. In recent years,
students said, most of the trouble
was caused by visitors.
UConn officials said they
have notified other schools
throughout New England that

outsiders will excluded this year.
“We’ve done just about
everything we can for the kids to
have a safe place to have fun in,”
Callahan said. “We are trying to
provide an event that is on
campus, safe and open only to
UConn students.”
Last year, police arrested
dozens of students on and
off campus. A crowd of about
5,000 started bonfires, and police
and firefighters were attacked
with rocks, bottles, cans and
garbage barrels.

M ansfield Town M anager
Martin Berliner said he and other
town
leaders
support
the
university’s efforts to confine the
partying on campus.
But others, such as state Sen.
Edith
Prague,
D-Columbia,
oppose the school’s decision to
sell alcohol.
“Is UConn
sending a
message that you can’t have a
good time w ithout alcohol? I
think so,” Prague said. “I
disagree with the way UConn is
handling this issue.”

Walking a mile in my shoes Letters to the editor-------------------------When I asked for input from the public, I guess I
was essentially asking for it. Today I received an
editorial that I’m not going to print because it was
ridiculous. I don't mind criticism, but to the person who
sent this, congratulations, you just wrote everything that
I already know.
Danielle
I ’m not going to personally attack you in any way
Belton
so I’m going to save all the drama and not even print
your name.Therefore, here is my response.
People tell me about the same problems I deal with everyday as
if I didn’t spend nearly 30 hours a week here. I know that the paper
has problems. I’ve been saying this since I became editor in chief.
So for you, and everyone else who’d like to know, these are the
problems at the paper, and here are the solutions, and here is what
we are currently doing.
1#: We have had only one copy editor for the majority of this
semester. She is a very good one, but it’s hard to copy edit an entire
paper late at night by yourself. Just recently we hired a new one, and
we hope he works out.
2#: We have a lot of MIA reporters, as in they are missing in
action. Most of our reporters have jobs/lives. Some have kids, some
have a large course load because they all are college students, and
some aren’t very dedicated when this is a job that requires
dedication. And in some cases w e’ve had to cut comers because if
someone leaves us or we dismiss someone, there is no replacement.
3#: We run AP because it’s often either that or blank pages. We
just don’t have enough reporters to handle the workload. There are
tons of stories that we miss because reporters will be hired, then
never show up again.
4#: We don’t tackle as many in-depth stories as w e’d like
because some of our reporters aren’t experienced enough to handle
it. And to avoid having to print a sub-par story, we cut it and run an
associated press story.
The fact that you want me to deny is the truth. You cannot
expect to have a quality paper when there isn't enough experienced
staff to back it up. I have tried to recruit reporters, but the point is
unless beginning mass communication students take more interest in
the paper, we’re going to be like this for a while. Our staff works
long hours for not nearly enough money, then often has to sacrifice
their classes to put out this paper. I don’t know if the person who
wrote this letter knows what it feels like to work for little pay for
long hours, and stay late at night, sometimes till midnight, to put out
a newspaper only so someone can turn to them and say they aren’t
doing enough.
I wrote this reply to defend my staff. You are not here when we
are here. When we are here at midnight making the paper you hate
so much, you get to enjoy the warm sanctuary of your bedroom. Our
advisor is lucky if he ever gets to look at his family. My section
editors came to college to work on their education, and I’m not
going to tell them that the Alestle comes before their classwork.
It’s so easy to look and speak from where you are standing. And
it’s so easy to complain about what you don’t understand. I’m not
asking for your sympathy and I don’t even want your help, all I want
you to do is read this and understand that what we are, and what you
think we are, are two different things. Spend a Monday night with
us and you will see, spend a week with us and you will want to run
screaming. This isn’t the most glamorous place to work on campus.
I wasn’t lying when I said I fall asleep in all my classes because the
night before I was here till 1 a.m. Why don’t you come back to
reality and walk a mile in my shoes?
Danielle Belton
Editor In Chief

Letters to the editor policy:
The editors, s ta ff and publishers of the Alestle
believe in the free exchange of ideas, concerns and
opinions and will publish as many letters to the editor as
possible. All letters should be typed and double-spaced
and be no longer than 5 0 0 words. Please include your
phone number, signature and social security number.
We reserve the right to edit letters for grammar and
content. However, great care will be taken to ensure that
the message of the letter Is not lost or altered.
Letters to the editor will not be printed anonymously
except under extreme circumstances.
The Alestle is a member of the Illinois College Press
Association.
The name Alestle is an acronym derived from the
names of the three campus locations of SIUE: Alton,
East St. Louis and Edwardsville.

Opinions from all around campus with more criticism on President Clinton and
editorials related to the subject, as well as some criticism toward the editor.
More Clinton Critical
Theory
This letter serves as a retort to
Mr. Phillips’ editorial that was
featured last week. Once again the
basis o f the argument has been
misconstrued, and accompanying
this misunderstanding are a few
allegations. To address the issue
of playing God, let me ask Mr.
Phillips if he takes a moral stance
on anything. If so, does sticking
up for these beliefs insinuate that
the person is trying to play God? I
think not. It only proves that the
person has enough guts to stand
up and communicate why he/she
thinks the issue is wrong. I would
never have the audacity to
compare myself to God, but I do
feel strongly on certain issues.
Secondly,
Mr.
Phillips
suggests that Ken Starr should
devote his time to people like
Michael Milken and leave the
president’s actions alone. Do you
understand the job description that
Mr. Starr possesses? Mr. Starr is
part of the Independent Counsel, a
separate entity designed to
investigate the presidency. Why
would he investigate a person
(who mind you was already
convicted and had served time in
prison) who dealt with junk bonds
if his position solely is to
investigate the president. The fault
lies not with Mr. Starr but instead
with the Independent Counsel.
This unnecessary office was
created (by Democrats) to
investigate presidents like Nixon
and Reagan. Many conservatives
were against this counsel because
they believed that the everyday
checks and balances would
eliminate the need for an entity to
investigate
the
president.
However, since a Democrat is
being investigated by this
Independent Counsel, now all the
Democrats are crying foul. If the
counsel was necessary and
important under Nixon and
Reagan, then people have no
reason to complain now. I myself
believe that this counsel should be
eliminated,
but
there
is
no need to criticize Mr. Starr;

he is only doing his job.
Finally, to address the
premature and asinine allegation
of hypocrisy, let me first ask when
anything about Republicans was
addressed prior to your letter?
The reason that a comment by Mr.
Gross was issued in the first place
was because of the flippant
remarks by Mr. Stulce about
Clinton. He was the one that
brought up Clinton, not Mr. Gross
or any other College Republican.
If he had made an argument about
the strong moral character of Bob
Packwood, and how a sexually
satisfied senator is a great senator,
then the same stance would have
been taken. I was appalled by the
actions of Senator Packwood (a
Republican), and I was pleased
when he resigned. Morals are not
based on partisanship. Whenever
a Republican takes the platform of
pro-choice, I am immediately
looking for a new candidate,
because my moral beliefs against
abortion are so strong that I will
not vote for that candidate.
Should I or anyone else be
chastised for this belief? Am I
playing God? Mr. Gross did not
state that Republicans have a
better moral track record than
Democrats, he merely stated that
Mr. Stulce’s lackadaisical attitude
towards Mr. Clinton was wrong,
in his opinion. All parties aside, I
believe that infidelity is wrong, no
matter who commits it. Everyone
has the right to air his/her
opinions, and that person should
not be ridiculed or judged merely
because of these opinions.
PS. I would like to commend
Ms. Belton for making snide
remarks against Mr. Jones and
then not even having the
gumption to attend the event to
see if her beliefs were correct.
Scott Thomas
Sr., Finance & Economics

Reggie was there, were
you?

Jones speak on the 15th. People
from throughout the state showed
up to listen to what Mr. Jones had
to say concerning what we could
do to save the inner cities and
why Sean Combs, a k a Puff
Daddy, is a capitalist. They also
heard how there was never any
hate that came out of the mouth of
Mr. Jones.
One person sticks out in my
mind as not being there though.
Now, it could be that this person
can write about certain issues, but
when it comes down to it, cannot
meet them face to face. This could
be the reason the person did not
show. However, it could be that
this person did show, but was
amazed by what Mr. Jones had to
say and therefore no longer felt a
need to question his legitimacy.
Whichever the case, Ms. Belton,
remember that you had your
chance. Mr. Jones was willing to
give you the chance to speak your
part, yet you did not give him the
chance. You chose to stay behind
your pen and paper.
PS. Rupert says hi.
Jason L. Holzum
Soph., undeclared
Editor’s note:
It seems that I have offended
some people, so I apologize, hut I
am certainly not one to hide from
an event. I think some simple
deduction would have caused a
person to figure out that Reginald
Jones came on a Wednesday night
and the Alestle comes out on
Thursday. I wanted to be there,
hut the paper w asn’t finished till
twelve in the morning. But if the
College Republicans ever need
someone fo r a debate as long as
its not on a Monday or Wednesday
night, I'd be happy to participate,
but 1 still think Rupert Murdock
makes a fa r more interesting
capitalist. I f anyone recorded or
took a record o f Reginald Jones
speech I would like to borrow it to
find out what I missed.

Thank you to everyone for
showing up to listen to Reginald

In politics, Illinois still facing north-south fights
SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) —
Like a family with a generationsold quarrel that never seems to
get settled, Illinois is split
betw een
dow nstaters
and
upstaters.
The conflict overlaps party
lines and social classes. As a
prominent downstate Democrat,
state Sen. Vince D em uzio of
Carlinville, says, “We used to be
fighting C hicago D em ocrats.
Now we are fighting suburban
Republicans.”
Pollsters see Illinois as
divided into three areas: Chicago,
the suburbs and downstate. But in
the view of many downstaters,
there is only one division —
north or south of Interstate 80.
The road runs from Hammond,
Ind., to M oline, slicing off
Chicago, its suburbs and outlying
“edge cities” from the rest of
the state.
The downstate-upstate, ruralm etropolitan division is being
played out anew now that
Dem ocrats have nom inated a
downstater for governor for the
first time in decades. Glenn
Poshard thinks politicians are

partly to blame for regional
frictions because they’ve found
that it “plays.”
“Everybody has been guilty of
it at one time or another,” he said.
“It’s very popular downstate to
bash Chicago, and so on.”
A five-term congressman from
“the largest agricultural district in
the
state,”
Poshard
says
parochialism is foolish in an
international economy. W hile
visiting the trading floor of the
Chicago Board of Trade recently,
he said, the link between the
m ulti-billion-dollar
futures
industry
and
dow nstate
agriculture was obvious. “But
hardly anybody who lives in
Chicago, or even downstate, even
thinks about that connection.”
If elected, Poshard would be
the first downstate Democratic
governor since John Stelle. A
lieutenant governor, Stelle served
as governor for three months in
1940 after the death of Gov.
Henry Homer, a Cook County
Democrat.
Republican
gubernatorial
nominee George Ryan, the
secretary of state, is from

UNITED NATIONS (AP) —
Iran appears to be cracking down
on an illegal oil smuggling
operation that was projected to
earn neighboring Iraq up to $120
million this year, U.N. and other
sources said Monday.
A U.S.-led multinational naval
force patrols the Persian Gulf to
intercept ships carrying Iraqi oil
in
violation
of
economic
sanctions im posed after Iraq’s
1990 invasion of Kuwait, which

U.N. sources have complained
for years that Iraq has been

by shipping fuel through Iranian

seized control of the emotional
downstate issue of how to
regulate factory-scale hog farms.
“He’s never even seen a hog
farm,” said Rep. Charles Hartke,
a
Teutopolis
farm er
and
M adigan’s chairm an o f the
House Democratic conference.
Jokingly, Hartke introduced a
“Large Law Firm Facility
M anagement A ct” to mimic
M adigan’s
large
livestock
facilities
m anagem ent
bill.
H artke’s bill w ould require
lawyers to get permission from
local officials to set up a firm
with more than two lawyers.
Madigan’s only comment was,
“I want to talk to Chuck about
raising the threshold (above two
lawyers).”
H artke’s
joshing
aside,
regionalism isn’t just a kind of
fraternity rivalry but rather a
serious conflict that often
determines how and where public
funds are spent.
Asked to recall issues driven
by regionalism during his eight
years in office, Edgar mentioned
the annual fights over the schoolaid formula, which divides state
money among urban and rural
school districts.
Also, Edgar said, airline
officials who oppose a third
major Chicago-area airport put
out word that the project would

siphon off m oney needed for
downstate roads. “That made
some of those guys (lawmakers)
nervous,” he said.
Former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon,
a downstater, stepped down from
the Senate in 1996 to head the
Public
Policy
Institute
at
Southern Illinois University. He
said of regionalism , “To the
extent that people have pride in
their area, it’s a healthy thing. To
the extent that it results in people
saying, ‘We can’t let Chicago get
too m uch,’ or, ‘We can ’t let
dow nstate too m uch,’ it’s an
unhealthy thing.
“Probably there is more that is
unhealthy about the rivalry than
is healthy.”
Simon noted that an upstatedownstate split is common in
states dominated by a single city:
Detroit in Michigan, New York
City in New York, Atlanta in
Georgia.
Maybe there’s just something
in human nature that promotes an
us-against-them viewpoint.
John Gianulis of Rock Island,
who chairs the Downstate
Democratic County Chairmen’s
Association, said he has watched
downstate-upstate fighting go on
for decades. But that isn’t what
really bothers him.
“I spend most of my time
trying to keep peace between the
north end of the county and the
south end of the county.”

Kankakee, south of 1-80 by about
35 miles. Nearly shut out of
Chicago politics since the 1930s,
the GOP lacks the city-vs.country schism of Democrats.
Downstate Republicans tend to
resent suburban DuPage County,
the
G O P’s
m etropolitan
stronghold.
Republican Gov. Jim Edgar,
who is retiring next January after
two terms, was the first
downstater of either party elected
governor in 62 years if you don’t
count William Stratton (195361), who lived in Grundy County
but grew up in Lake County.
Edgar, of Charleston, agrees
with Poshard that regionalism is a
politician’s game. “There’s more
of it in politics than there is in
normal life,” he said. “Politicians
have a tendency to play that card
one way or the other.”
“The paranoia of downstaters
vs. Chicago isn’t as great as when
I first came to state government
30 years ago,” Edgar said. “I’ve
seen
more
paranoia
of
Chicagoans toward downstate, as
you’ve seen the shift of power
away from the city.”

through its territorial seas.”
“In this regard, we note that
the Iranian governm ent has
recently played a helpful role in
enforcing the sanctions on air
travel to and from Iraq by
requiring that planes wishing to
enter Iraq obtain the appropriate
approval from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee before overflying
Iranian territory,” Clinton said in
the April 6 letter.
A copy o f the letter was
obtained by The Associated Press
on Monday.
Last year, sources in the
M aritime Interception Force,
which patrols the gulf to enforce
sanctions, said the Iranian
Revolutionary Guards were
selling ship captains bogus
papers indicating their vessels
were carrying Iranian goods not
covered by the embargo.

In a report last year to the
Security Council, the force said
illegal Iraqi sales were expected
to reach $75 million in 1997 and
$120 million this year.
But sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the
Iranians in recent months
apparently have stopped helping
smugglers, forcing them to sail in
international waters where they
can be intercepted.
The sources said Iran’s
motives were unclear. They said
the crackdown could be part of a
campaign to improve ties with
the West that Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami began after
his landslide election last May.
It also could reflect tension
within the Iranian government
between Khatami and his hard­
line opponents, who m aintain
close ties to the Revolutionary
Guards
involved
in
the
smuggling.

Body of missing student found around corner
CARRABASSETT VALLEY,
Maine (AP) — Searchers used
dogs, snowmobiles and aircraft to
look for Kevin Zebrow ski, a
college student from New Jersey
last seen in a motel bar on a

His parents left their jobs to
look for him, posting fliers in
New England and Canada.

More than 3 1/2 months later,
the body of the 21-year-old
Zebrowski was found behind a
convenience store just 340 yards
down the road from the bar,
leaving

HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) —
Soccer fans trying to get into a
packed stadium for a free match
between Zimbabwe’s two most
popular teams caused a stampede
in which four people died, news
reports said Sunday.
The
Saturday
m atch
culm inated
celebrations
of
Zimbabwe’s 18th anniversary of
independence. Earlier, President
Robert Mugabe lit a symbolic
flame in the 60,000-seat National
Sports stadium.
The stadium was filled to
capacity
for
the
free
Independence Trophy m atch
between
D ynam os
and
H ighlanders, Z im babw e’s top
premier division clubs.

Once the stadium was full,
thousands more fans tried to
force their way in and police
were unable to control an
onslaught, The Sunday Mail
newspaper reported.
In the crush, four people died
and 10 were seriously injured, the
state-controlled newspaper said.
Ziana, the Zim bwean news
agency, also reported the same
casualty statistics.
There was no immediate word
Sunday from police or hospital
authorities on the condition of
the injured.
The game proceeded despite
the stampede, with Dynamos
winning 2-0.

He was gone when the driver
returned at 2 a.m.
Zebrowski’s father left his
banking job and his mother took
a leave of absence from a
cosmetics company so they
could move from Rahway, N.J.,
to Farmington and conduct their
own search.
The parents posted a $25,000
reward for information about
Kevin’s disappearance. There
were candlelight vigils at the
university.
The
family
distributed thousands of fliers.
Meanwhile, the body lay a

Vicki Gregory said. “So that
is the shocking part, finding

LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Gov.
Ben Nelson would not disclose his
plans for a controversial state aid
proposal after lawmakers passed
the measure on the last day of the
1998 session.
Nelson said Tuesday he had
only heard bits and pieces of the
debate that lasted about three
hours, but he intends to review the
transcript and the arguments made
before making a decision. Nelson
earlier this week said he was
considering vetoing it.
Senators wrestled with their
options for best dealing with the
bill (LB 1175) that includes an
amendment adopted last week by
a 25-0 vote in less than five
minutes. Sen. Bob Wickersham,
who introduced the amendment,
and Sen. Ardyce Bohlke, who
chairs the Education Committee,
argued the issue can always be
revisited next year.
Wickersham defended his
amendment, which could lead to
as much as $70 million more in
state aid to schools in the year
2001. Wickersham said it doesn’t
increase spending, it just changes
the formula under which the aid
will be distributed.
The decision on how to
provide state aid to schools was

made last year when the
Legislature passed LB806. That
said it is the intent of the
Legislature to provide enough aid
to schools to ensure that they do
not have to increase their tax levy
beyond the limit imposed by the
state. With his amendment,
Wickersham changed that to say
the Legislature “shall” provide
that money.
It is the state’s obligation to
ensure schools can function under
the levy lids and spending limits
imposed by the Legislature,
Wickersham said.
Starting July 1, schools will be
limited to collected $1.10 per
$100 of assessed valuation. That
will decrease to $1 in 2001. There
is expected to be a $70 million
difference in the current state aid
and what will be needed to ensure
schools can remain below the $1
limit.
All the amendment does,
Wickersham said, is put in place a
formula for calculating what
amount the state will need to
ensure schools do not have to vote
to exceed the levy lid.
“It seems to me this is a
mechanism for giving
the
Legislature a clear policy choice
to make next year,” Speaker Doug

Kristensen said at a morning
briefing on the issue.
What the provision really will
do, Omaha Sen. Pam Brown said,
is result in an overfunding of
education while nothing is done to
encourage schools to become
more efficient.
Sen. Kermit Brashear argued
the bill may be unconstitutional
because it obligates a future
Legislature to spend an undefined
amount of money. Sen. Ernie
Chambers agreed and said the
Legislature should remove the
amendment before passing the
bill.
But to do that, the Legislature
would have had to extend the
session for two days. Chambers’
motion to extend the session fell
23 votes short of the 40 needed to
succeed.
The bill passed 34-8. If signed
by Nelson, it becom es law
immediately.
Even though Wickersham said
the bill does not increase state
spending, Lincoln Sen. Don
Wesely said the Nebraska
Business Summit will use it to its
advantage in an effort to gather
signatures on a petition for a
constitutional amendment limiting
state spending.

■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
cstulce@siue.edu
I had a pretty exciting
weekend. There w asn’t even
enough time for me to get ticked
about anything and write about
it. So, to fill my space today, I
will give you a rundown of what
I did Saturday, leading into
Sunday morning.
9:00 a.m. I wake up a little bit
hung over in a strange Southern
city. I have to leave with Tom to
pick up a stranger at the airport
in Oklahoma City.
11:35 a.m. We’re a little late,
thanks to Tom getting on the
wrong exit. But, we pick up the
stranger, a pretty young lady
with a sharp tongue named
Michelle. We all hit it off
instantly.
2:45 p.m. We are at a
shopping mall in Oklahom a City
trying on clothes. I mention to
Tom that I would like to find a
Hawaiian shirt.
3:18 p.m. All three of us buy
Hawaiian shirts at Gadzooks.
Mine is green with surfers on it.
Rayon feels good on the skin.
4:08 p.m. We decide to wear
our Hawaiian shirts out tonight.
We drive 20 miles out of the way
to find leis and straw hats to go
with the shirts.
7:16 p.m. We get scolded for
coming back so late with the
strange girl we just met.
12:16 a.m. — Sunday. We get
many odd looks, cheers and
catcalls in Stillwater, Okla. for
our Hawaiian attire. Sometimes
it’s fun to be an oddball.
2:45 a.m. Six of us play sand
volleyball. We only wear boxer
shorts, even though it’s about 50
degrees. I talk trash to the
opposing team and piss them off.
We win.

NEW YORK (AP) — The classic
1929 love song “You Were Meant
for M e” floats through "The
Object of My Affection,” a mildmannered
love
story
that
champions family and friendship
in just about every conceivable
combination. If only the movie
were as simple, direct and
charming as the song is.
It focuses on a gay man and a
pregnant woman, (no, he’s not
the father), who meet and move
in together after the guy is
dumped by his self-absorbed
boyfriend. Can friendship in such
close quarters develop into
something more? And if it does,
will the relationship last?
The movie is based on
Stephen M cC auley’s keenly
observant novel, which is funny,
sardonic and often poignant.
Those qualities make only
occasional
appearances
in
playwright Wendy Wasserstein’s
uncertain screen adaptation. She
rinses everything in soap opera,
diluting the spirit of the book and
letting the action slip into
halfhearted melodrama.

Jennifer Aniston of television’s

these
characteristics.
One
wonders what George sees in this
bland woman.
The script’s variable quality
seems to have unnerved director
Nicholas Hytner, who had a sure
command of the material in his
other films, “The Madness of
King
G eorge”
and
“The
Crucible.” With “The Object of
My A ffection,” H ytner can’t
decide whether his movie is a
romantic, screwball or situation
comedy. He makes unconvincing
attempts at all three.
Considering
W asserstein’s
flair for comedy, it is particularly
disappointing that a lot of the
comic characters, such as the
nosy downstairs neighbor and the
older dancing instructor who
teaches the mismatched couple to
tango, fall flat.
There are pleasures to be
found in several of the other
supporting actors. Particularly
effective is an acerbic Allison
Janney as N in a’s upwardly
mobile stepsister, married to a
cranky and high-powered literary
agent, w onderfully played by
Alan Alda.
Yet these perform ances are
only momentary diversions. “The
Object of My A ffection” is
a movie as unsure of itself as
the leading characters are of
each other.

Move over Springer: Buttafuoco’s got a brand new bag
WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Add
talk show host to the resume of Joey
Buttafuoco.
The Long Island Lolita’s half-hour talk show
on cable access premiered Thursday, joining
the ranks of the “Eggroll K ing,” porno
aficionado Colin Malone and a horde of cult
celebrities who by law are allowed free
airtime on cable and otherwise wouldn’t make
it on commercial TV.
The debut was heralded at the Rainbow Bar
and Grill on Sunset Boulevard, where
comedian John Belushi was once eulogized.
On Thursday, Buttafuoco fans and friends at
the bar shared pizza and fries while watching
a big-screen TV as he acted as master of
ceremonies.
“This is a forum for anybody who has been
jammed up by law enforcement, who has been
abused by the media, who has been chewed up
and spit out by the system,” Buttafuoco said in
an interview.
The show, which airs Thursdays at
11:30 p.m. on public access cable, opens with
shots of a leather-clad Buttafuoco tooling
around West Hollywood on a motorcycle.

Various shots include his name on the
marquee at the Whiskey Club on Sunset
Boulevard. A rock guitar hook sets the mood
as a chorus chants “Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey
Buttafuoco,” the only lyrics in the short
introduction.
The set is simple: two office-type
chairs and a dark background. His guests,
like him self, are scandal-ridden and
probed for details about their brush, or crash,
into infamy.
His first guest was Divine Brown, who was
arrested in Hollywood in 1995 while engaging
in a sex act with actor Hugh Grant in a car.
Brown, whose real name is Estella
Thompson, says she is still down-to-earth
despite all the attention.
, “I’m still the same person,” said Brown.
Buttafuoco served four months in jail after
pleading guilty to the liaison with Amy Fisher,
who was 16 when she later shot his wife, Mary
Jo, in the face in May 1992. Buttafuoco also
was given five years’ probation, and last year
he went back to jail for violating that
probation by soliciting sex from an

undercover cop on H ollyw ood’s Sunset
Boulevard, a crime, he maintains, he never
committed.
Other guests include actor Jan Michael
Vincent, whose career has been marred by a
history of substance abuse and at least two
alcohol-related car accidents; Liza Greer, a
contributor to the bestseller “You’ll Never
Make Love In This Town Again,” a tell-all
about how famous people have sex; and
his wife Mary Jo, who was caught in a
nearly fatal love triangle with her husband and
his mistress.
The Buttafuocos moved from New York to
Los Angeles about two years ago with their
two children. Besides the talk show,
Buttafuoco is pursuing an acting career and
works at an auto body shop.
"He doesn’t hide the fact that he was a bad
boy and he doesn’t have a problem bringing
that to the front,” said Jay Hastings, 38, a fan
who loved the debut. “What he did was talk to
the audience and made it like a Jerry Springer
thing, like he was having fun. It was cool.”

DENVER (AP) — W illiam
M edina and C laudia Luevano
thought they were buying a cute
outfit for their young son, Willie.
Instead, they say, the talking shirt
blurted an obscenity.
Their com plaint has led
Kmart Corp. to pull thousands of
talking
children’s
Cookie
Monster T-shirts from 2,100
stores nationwide.
The shirt has the Sesam e
Street character at the wheel of a
dump truck filled with cookies,
with a button children can push to
hear the message, “Stand back.
Here comes cookies. M mmm,
delicious.”
M edina and Luevano said
Thursday they heard an obscene
phrase instead of “Stand back”
on the $12.99 shirt and shorts
set they bought Saturday for
their 19-month-old son at a
Denver store.
“I was showing everybody
and they were saying it’s the
same word,” Medina said.

M en’s te n n is w ins GLVC title ; R e ith e r named P layer o f th e Year
■ BY SARAH FINLEY
SPORTS EDITOR
This past weekend, the m en’s
tennis team proved that one loss
is nothing to slow them down.
The Cougars came home
with the Great Lakes Valley
Conference trophy by defeating
the U niversity of Southern
Indiana, the same team that beat
them last week.

“When we won, they were in a
state of shock,” head coach Bill
Logan said of Southern Indiana.
Before the Cougars battled
Southern Indiana, they had to
defeat Lewis University and
University of Indianapolis.
In the quarterfinals, the
Cougars whipped the Lewis
Flyers 5-1.
“We had a strong performance
in the singles,” said Logan.
Next up were the semi-finals

and the Greyhounds.
The Cougars took it down to
the final second with a 6-3 finish.
“It was the toughest match of
the tournament,” Logan said. “It
was up to [Zaid] Nuhmany and
[Keith] Harvie. They both had
match point in their matches.”
After their close encounter,
they went on to face the team that
robbed them of a possible NCAA
appearance.
“We literally blew them out of

the water,” said Logan. “We
lominated the doubles.”
SIUE beat the Scream ing
Eagles 5-0.
“Numany played with shin
splints and still won his match 61, 6-3,” Logan said.
Not only did the Cougars take
home a conference victory they
also had Mike Reither and Jason
Stephens named to the 1998 AllGLVC M en’s Tennis team.
Mike Reither was also named

the Player of the Year.
Since SIUE lost to Southern
Indiana in regular season play,
they got the bid to the NCAA,
but Logan hopes by winning
this past weekend, they might
have a chance.
“The loss knocked us out of
the NCAA, but by beating
Indiana Saturday we might get a
bid. We just have to wait and
see,” Logan said.

slick Road R unner.
Over the w eekend, the
Cougars threw their TN T at
conference
foe
N orthern
Kentucky
University
and
completed a three game sweep at
Roy E. Lee Field.
The first game was an oldfashioned pitcher’s duel for most
of the game. Then the SIUE
offense came alive and pounded
Northern Kentucky with nine
runs in the sixth inning en route
to a 10-0 win.
Rob LaMarsh made opposing
batters look clueless, going the
full seven innings. He struck out
eight and surrendered just five
hits, improving his impressive
record to a perfect 7-0.
The shutout was the first of
the year for LaM arsh. SIUE
coach Gary Collins is more than
satisfied with the success of the
Cougar hurler.
“He has been ahead of the
hitters all year,” Collins said.
Cougar first baseman Jason
Sievert had three hits, including
his fourth home run o f the

season, and knocked in four runs
as well.
In the second game, SIUE
took an early lead only to fall
behind by three at the end of six
innings. The Coyote had finally
backed the Road Runner into a
comer, but he didn’t stay there
long. Eric Pruitt, Rusty Sames,
and Jason Guest knocked the
coyote off the cliff, shutting out
Northern Kentucky in the final
three innings.
SIUE scored three in the
seventh to tie the game 8-8, then
twice in the eighth to go ahead.
The Cougars won the game 10-8.
“They pitched real w ell,”
Collins said of his bullpen. “I’ve
been happy with them, especially
Eric [Pruitt], Rusty [Sarnes], and
Jason [Guest]. Having a good
bullpen is good heading into the
end of the year.”
On Sunday, the Cougars
completed their sweep, winning
11-4. Aaron Rakers pitched
seven solid innings, improving
his winning record to 5-2.
SIUE second baseman Mark
Bugger went three for six and
centerfielder Mark Briggs had a
pair of hits and three RBIs in the
win. The two men at the top of
the batting order have gone a
combined 12 for 21 in their last
two games.
“Anytime your top two men
get on base you’re going to score
a lot of runs,” Collins said.
“When they don’t get on, it’s
harder to score runs.”
The Cougars are 12-2 in
GLVC play and 26-9 overall.

The SIUE softball team could
only answer one half o f the
equation last weekend as the No.
1 seed in the Great Lakes Valley
Conference tournament.
An outstanding defensive
weekend was spoiled by a lack of
hitting on SIUE’s part.
After winning their first and
second round games on Friday,
the Cougars lost to the University
of Southern Indiana and Quincy
University on Saturday to settle
for third place in the tournament.
Sarah Sollberger and Mandy
Uhrhan both went two for three
and scored a run, as SIUE hung
on for a 2-1 victory over the
University of Indianapolis in the
opening game.
Junior Niki M itts’ RBI triple
in the fourth capped off a two run
inning
for
the
Cougars.
Indianapolis came back with a
run in the top of the sixth, but

win of the season.
Sophomore Kari Franzen,
who was named to the All-GLVC
first team, led SIUE in its second
round victory over the No. 5
seed, the University of MissouriSt. Louis, 5-3.
“She [Franzen] has done a
great job of catching for us,”
Montgomery said. “She’s caught
all 50 games for us. That shows
how valuable she is to this team.”
Franzen went two for two with
a double and two runs scored.
Gwen Jackson, of Collinsville,
had an RBI single, stole a base
and scored a run. Kim Messinger
added an RBI double in the win.
Pitcher Deanna Sm ith, of
Morton, took her record to 10-8
on the year by allowing only five
hits against UMSL.
The SIUE bats went cold in a
2-0 loss to the U niversity of
Southern Indiana in the third
round on Saturday.

No. 3 seed in a game that would
send the w inner to
the
cham pionship game.
“We had a lot of opportunities
to score. It just didn’t happen for
us,” M ontgom ery said. “We
played great defense to hold them
to two runs, but we didn’t hit.”
The loss sent SIUE into a
game against Quincy University
with the winner moving on to
face Southern Indiana in the
championship game on Sunday.
Runs were at a premium as
neither team scored a run through
six innings. Quincy broke
through to score four runs in
the top of the seventh inning.
SIUE started to make a charge
in the bottom o f the inning, but
could only manage to cross the
plate once. W ith the 4-1 loss,
the Cougars picked up a third
place finish.

Sports Column: NFL D ra ft: big nam es don’t alw ays mean big team s
■ BY SARAH FINLEY
SPORTS EDITOR
sfinley@siue.edu
As I watched the NFL Draft
this past weekend, something
almost elementary occurred to
me: what are coaches with a less
than average team doing drafting
big-name players?
I can understand that they
might add a level of performance
that they are not achieving right
now, but what about the other
players that have to contribute to
the success of the team?
It is true that one good player

can help a team, but if that one
doesn’t have the other members
behind him he becomes mediocre
in the eyes o f the fans.
Take the Indianapolis Colts:
not only did they finish dead last
with a 3-13 record in their
division, they drafted No. 1 pick
Peyton Manning.
True he is a quarterback, true
he is good, but where are his
linemen, running backs and wide
receivers? W ho is he going to
play with?
W hat about Jim Harbaugh?
He has 11 years experience in the
NFL. Is Manning taking over or

Don’t get me wrong. I am not
bashing a team for grabbing an
asset when the opportunity
presents itself. I just worry about
the people who are hoping that
this name will help the team by
some miracle.
I have close friends that play
college football, and they seem to
think that the idea o f a golden
name is ridiculous.
One of my friends said that it
is true players are recruited for
their abilities with no thoughts of
the team, but at his college they
are recruited and, regardless of
their previous position, they are

is he just there as a back-up?
Marshall Faulk is definitely a
great player, but they must not
feel as if Faulk is enough for the
team, though they also picked up
two more wide receivers.
As for linemen, they have a
fresh crop o f rookies from last
season and two new guards for
this season. And their backfield
isn’t looking too bad with the
addition of a defensive back and
a linebacker.
That sounds like a decent
start for a not-so-decent team.
They might have a chance for a
.500 season.

SIUE b o d yb u ild e rs to com pete in
SOFTBALL
Caveman C lassic c o n te s t in M isso u ri “Once again, we couldn’t get

tested at all positions to see if
where they are is really the right
place for them.
It almost seems a waste of
time at the higher levels of the
game, but the thought might be
entertained by those who have
quarterbacks and wide receivers
three-deep in the roster.
W hatever
happens
with
M anning, I do hope that he
adds to the lineup and helps
the Colts. I just hope that all
the hype doesn’t go to his or
the coaches heads and they lose

Dave Adlfinger and Mary Ann
McFall will compete April 25 in
one of the largest bodybuilding
competitions in the nation, The
Caveman Classic. It is held at
Meramec Caverns in Stanton, Mo.
This com petition is divided
into six divisions with specific
weight classes for each division.
The divisions include the open,
novice, wheelchair, pairs, masters
(men), and teens (men).
The top two in each weight
class of the men’s and women’s
open-division will qualify for the
national bodybuilding show.
The overall winners in each of
the m en’s and wom en’s opendivision will receive beautiful

trophies: over six-foot tall with
large sculptures on top and
a hand-crafted, wood-lettered
“caveman club” valued at
$300 dollars. The top five
places in each weight class will
receive beautiful trophies over
five-foot tall.
Dave Adlfinger, a junior at
SIUE, is returning to the Caveman
Classic as the Novice middle­
weight
champion
(second
overall). He has his hopes set on
finishing in the top two and
qualifying for the National Show.
“This year I am shooting for a
National qualification,” Adlfinger
said. “With the experience I
gained last year, I think I have a
shot.”
Adlfinger, a form er SIUE
wrestler, will com pete in the
open middle-weight division (176
pound class).

Mary Ann is also a junior at
SIUE. She is competing in the
wom en’s
open
light-weight
division this Saturday and hopes
to finish in the top 5 in her class.
Mary Ann was St. Louis’
Miss Lightweight in 1996.
She also placed fourth the
Extreme Naturals Competition
in 1997 and fourth in the
Show-Me N aturals in 1998.
Naturals means a drug-tested
competition.
Both Adlfinger and Mary Ann
will agree, bodybuilding requires
a lot of sacrifice and hard work.
“When training for a show,
bodybuilders combine three-hour
workouts with strict dieting.”
Mary Ann said. “I can’t wait to eat
normal again."
Prejudging begins at 10:00
a.m., and the evening show
begins at 7:00 p.m.

In the wom en’s discus throw
Beck took thrid, Louderman took
sixth, Saunders ninth and Collins
took 12th.

In the wom en’s javelin throw,

New York’s Yankee Stadium celebrates 75th anniversary
NEW YORK (AP) — On a
sunny spring afternoon, just days
before Yankee Stadium was to
celebrate its 75th birthday, a 500pound steel joint came tumbling
out of the upper level of the
landmark ballpark and crashed
into the empty seats below.
It was a poignant reminder
that this grand old baseball
shrine is beginning to show
its age. Yankee Stadium is like
a dowager, still dignified,
still revered.
The latest episode, which
forced the postponement of two
games and sent a third across
town to Shea Stadium, could
speed a Yankees move elsewhere,
perhaps to a new stadium. It
will take some doing, though,
to replace Yankee Stadium, a
place with a glorious legacy
and moments unm atched in
sports history.
“It really is the cathedral of
baseball,” Yankees pitcher David
Cone said. “But that doesn’t alter
the infrastructure problem s.”
This is the House that Ruth
Built, a baseball palace where a
dying Lou Gehrig called himself,
“The luckiest man on the face of
the earth.”
This is where a graceful Joe
DiMaggio played center field so
effortlessly and a gaudy Reggie
Jackson turned every O ctober
into his personal showcase.
This is where Babe Ruth hit
No. 60 and Roger Maris topped it
with No. 61, where M ickey
Mantle hit one off the roof and
Don Larsen pitched his World
Series perfect game.
This is Yankee Stadium, 75
years old, a landmark ballpark

conceived out of anger and
constructed with spite, home to
32 American League champions
and 23 World Series champions.
Bob Sheppard has been the
public address announcer at the
Stadium for nearly half a century.
“The first team I introduced
had Johnny Mize at first base,
Jerry Coleman at second base,
Phil Rizzuto at shortstop, Billy
Johnson at third base, Jackie
Jensen in left field, Joe DiMaggio
in center field, Mickey Mantle in
right field, Yogi Berra catching
and Vic Raschi pitching,” he
said. “Five of them are in the Hall
of Fame and if Whitey Ford had
started that day, it would have
been six. I don’t think you can
top that.
“Yankee Stadium is a special
place because of all the history.
It’s loaded with tradition.”
The Stadium has been the
venue for more than baseball.
This is where Joe Louis
knocked out Max Schmeling in a
June
1938
heavyweight
championship fight that carried
major political overtones. This is
where the Baltimore Colts beat
the New York Giants for the 1958
NFL cham pionship
in
an
overtime game that became a
defining moment for pro football.
And this is where Knute Rockne
is supposed to have given his
“Win one for the Gipper” speech
to the Notre Dame football team
in 1928.
But first and foremost, Yankee
Stadium means baseball.
The seeds for this huge,
handsome stadium were sowed in
the feud between the old New
York Giants, landlords at, the

oddly shaped Polo Grounds,
where the principal tenants were
the young New York Yankees.
And the feud, like almost all
before or since, had its roots
in money.
The Yankees were quiet,
nonthreatening tenants in the
home of the Giants until 1920
when the Boston Red Sox,
starving for cash, sold an oddlooking outfielder named Ruth to
New York.
The Babe was som ething
straight out of the comic pages, a
moonfaced slugger with a
bulbous body supported on pipethin legs and capable of hitting
baseballs great distances.
In 1920, his first year with the
Yankees, Ruth hit an unheard-of
54 home runs, generating
attention the Yankees had never
before enjoyed. Their attendance
doubled to 1,289,422 — oVer
100,000 more than came to see
the Giants.
This angered landlord John
M cGraw and he reacted by
evicting his tenants, notifying
the Yankees in 1921 that they
would have to find somewhere
else to play. M cG raw ’s idea
was to ship the Yankees to the
hinterlands, maybe Queens,
maybe Long Island, any place
where they w ouldn’t compete
with the Giants.
Yankees
owners Jacob Rupert and
Tillinghast l’Hommedieu Huston
had other ideas.

They would build their own
ballpark all right, but not in the
suburbs as McGraw had hoped.
Instead, Yankees m anagem ent
chose a site ju st across the
Harlem River in the Bronx, a spot
within walking distance of the
Polo Grounds, one subway stop
away. It would be a baseball
shrine, built deliberately in the
shadow of M cGraw’s ballpark,
the ultimate answer of a tenant to
a landlord.
New ballparks were all the
rage at the time. The Detroit
Tigers built Navin Field, now
Tigers Stadium, for $300,000 in
1912, the same year the Boston
Red Sox moved into quaint, new
Fenway Park. Two years later,
Weeghman Park in Chicago, later
renamed Wrigley Field, was built
for about $250,000 for the Cubs.
Rupert and Huston had far
more ambitious ideas. They
would build a showcase, a place
that would dw arf those other
structures. They would build not
just a ballpark. They would build
a stadium.
The land, a former farm and
lumber yard bought from the
estate of William Waldorf Astor,
cost $675,000. The stadium cost
an additional $2.5 million. The
combined cost was just over $3.1
million, less than one-twentieth
of the team’s 1998 payroll.
The plan was for a triple­
decked stadium with 70,000
seats, its roof bedecked with a

distinctive 15-foot copper facade
that set this structure apart
from others.
In less than a year, 284
working days to be exact, Yankee
Stadium was completed and open
for business. Opening day was
April 18, 1923, a chilly,
Wednesday
afternoon.
The
proprietors celebrated it in
appropriate fashion, arranging for
John Philip Sousa to lead the
Seventh Regiment Band to the
center field flagpole, followed by
the Yankees and Boston Red Sox.
The Stadium was oddly
designed, with the right field
fence just 296 feet away, perfect
for a left-handed power hitter,
someone
like Ruth.
How
appropriate then that the first
homer in the Stadium was hit
by Ruth in the fourth inning
against journeym an
pitcher
Howard Ehmke. Ehmke would
win 20 games that season but
that opener was not one of them.
The Yankees prevailed 4-1, three
of the runs coming on the homer
by Ruth.
The Yankees would win 98
games that season, finish. 16
games ahead and then play in the
World Series against their old
pals from across the Harlem
River. How satisfying it must
have been for the organization
when they beat McGraw and the
Giants for their first world
championship.
