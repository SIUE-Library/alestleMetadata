The American Red Cross plans to build its 170,000 square-foot building at the corner of University Park
Drive and South Research Drive.

Red Cross facility
to bring 500 jobs
by Matthew Schroyer

Alestle Reporter
W hat currently rests as a vacant lot in
University Park could have a significant impact on
the University and the M idwest at large, if all goes
according to die plans o f the American Red Cross
and University Park officials.
The Red Cross announced Wednesday that it
will build a 170,000 square-foot building at the
corner o f University Park Drive and South Research
Drive to process blood products. It is designed to
replace a 50-year-old building in St. Louis that was
not designed for large-scale blood manufacturing
and has “ aging infrastructure,” according to a Red
Cross press release.
The new building, which will occupy a 15-acre
site in University Park, will incorporate the
headquarters for the Illinois-Missouri Blood Region
as well as the larger South Central Region, and
house one o f the five Red Cross National Testing
Labs in the U .S.
“ We’re going to accom modate the majority o f

the M idwest,” American Red Cross spokesperson
Jam es Williams said.
The R ed Cross makes several different types o f
blood products out o f blood donations, including
white blood cells, platelets and plasma. The former
Illinois-Missouri Blood Region headquarters in St.
Lou is could process 50 0 ,0 0 0 individual blood
products a year. With the new facility, the Red Cross
plans to boost that capacity and speed up blood
processing.
“ We’re going to double that to 1 million right
out o f the gates,” Williams said.
The site selection represents the next step in a
process that began six years ago, when the Red
Cross conducted a national study o f its blood
processing facilities and found that m ajor
renovations were needed, according to a R ed Cross
press release.
In 2006, the Red Cross began looking for sites
in the St. Louis Metro area to build the new facility,
which has an estimated price tag o f $ 5 0 million.

BUILDING
from pg. 1
Out o f 20 possible spaces,
S IU E ’s 330-acre University Park
came out the victor.
“ I think that it means we
competed well,” University Park
Director Jam es Pennekamp said.
“University Park presented a very
attractive site with the added
advantage
of
having
the
university nearby.”
Director o f Public Affairs
G reg
C onroy
credited
collaboration with local and state
entities to help bring the A R C to
S IU E , as well as the university’s
potential to supply skilled labor.
“ The resources o f the
university were som e o f the main
items that attracted the Red
Cross to our cam pus,” Conroy
said.
The
new
building
is
designed to have a workforce o f
more than 5 0 0 , with a total
payroll
near
$25
million.
Although m ost o f the employees
will be transferred from the St.
Louis office, the R ed Cross and
SIU E might cooperate further to
sponsor internships and job
opportunities.
“ There’s an opportunity for
additional kinds o f research and
projects,” C on roy said, and
added that nursing, pharmacy
and biological science students
would be targeted for potential
internships.
“ That’s why University Park
was set up,” Conroy said.
Conroy said the latest, and
by far the biggest, addition helps
further University Park’s goals o f
becom ing a technological and
econom ic pow erhouse o f the
region, and sets it apart from
other developments.
“ When we stared this in the

m id 1980s, this w as cutting
edge,” Conroy said. “ We were
one o f only a handful.”
University Park and its 23
existing tenants have a $ 3 5 6
million impact on the economy,
and collectively em ploys a 2,300person workforce, C onroy said.
“ It’s all ab ou t econom ic
development,” Conroy said. “ We
have a big im pact on the area.”
The impact can also be felt
for the C ity o f Edw ardsville,
which also to o k part in the
collaborative effort.
“In terms o f jo b creation and
employment, to the best o f my
knowledge, this is the largest
single project in the city o f
Edwardsville with the exception
o f the University,” Edwardsville
Mayor Gary N iebur said.
N iebur said the prospect o f
having 500 more employees in
Edwardsville will have an impact,
as they would bring business, and
might even m ove to the area.
“ We estimate that a good
percentage o f the employees that
do not live in this area are going
to find the attractiveness o f
m oving to this com m unity,”
N iebur said. “ T he econom ic
impact stands to be extremely
positive for the area.”
Conroy said he hopes that
the move will inspire other St.
L o u is businesses that m ight
otherwise think o f Edwardsville
as “ the other side o f the world” to
consider University Park.
“I would like to see more St.
Louis businesses take a look at
us,” Conroy said.

Freshman pageant queen loses crown
after hookah pictures surface
by Maggie Rhynes

Alestle Reporter
A first-time pu ff on a hookah has led to the end
o f SIU E freshman Ann Knight’s reign as a pageant
queen.
Knight was crowned M iss Tuscola in March,
but the crown was revoked when photos o f her
smoking a hookah were presented to the Tuscola
Chamber o f Com merce board.
The chamber voted that Knight’s actions were
breech o f contract. Knight, however, said she
wasn’t aware she was breeching her contract.
“ I truly did not know I was violating the
contract,” she said. “ I knew I was not supposed to
drink or smoke weed. I don’t even smoke; I
actually have asthma.”
H ookah is the name o f a water pipe used to
inhale flavored tobacco. H ookah lounges and
cafes are growing in popularity and a number o f
them exist in the St. L ou is area.
Knight, who is 18 and legally allowed to
smoke tobacco, said she m ust have overlooked
the no-smoking portion on the contract.
“ Evidently it is in the contract and I just
overlooked it,” she said. “Probably because I

the Tuscola Chamber o f Commerce and the matter
was discussed at a chamber meeting. Knight said
she was unaware that the chamber had seen the
photos or was discussing them until she received a
phone call informing her that she was being relieved
o f her duties.
The Tuscola Chamber o f Com merce president
released a statement that Said the matter is only
between the chamber and Knight.
Knight was surprised by the chamber’s actions
but said she was assured that die m atter would
remain “low key.” The first reports o f Knight losing
her crown ran in local newspapers that same day.
“ They left it open in the paper, as to what I had
done, so everyone was thinking I had done
som ething really bad,” Knight said.
Then the media caught hold o f the story.
“I cannot believe it has been made into as big
o f a deal as it has been. I come from a town widi
four stop lights,” Knight said. “ They said it would
be low-key, then three days later I’m getting phone
calls that it is in every paper.”
She has received numerous phone calls from
the m edia, including the N B C Today Show.
All the prizes associated with the M iss Tuscola
crown m ust now be returned, leaving Knight to pay
back a $ 1 ,0 0 0 scholarship and an estimated $ 3 0 0 to

T -S h irts?"

Back when tens o f thousands
flocked to the M ississippi River
Festival at S IU E , Jane FloydHendey would som etim es don a
special outfit.
It was a long blue-jean skirt,
homemade from a pair o f pants,
and accented with a touch o f
embroidery. She’d also complete
the look with a tie-dyed shirt,
marked with the custom ary peace
sign o f the times.
“ Som e things in life cannot
be duplicated,” Floyd-H endey,
director o f D isability Su pp ort
Services, said. “ That whole 10 or
12 years, those were the m ost
wonderful times in my life. Just
the whole feeling that society had
at that time, just being more
carefree, and not into status.”
She remembers seeing such
bands as Jackson Browne and the
Who, who mesmerized her with
sight and sound.
Now, approaching S IU E ’s
50th birthday, Floyd-H endey is
breaking out the outfit, dusting it
o ff and wearing it for one more
concert.
Rebecca
D abbs-K ayser,
Floyd-H endey’s daughter and
director o f the Early Childhood
Center, was also in attendance,
though she was too young to
remember much.
“ I rem em ber seeing the
Osm onds as a family,” DabbsKayser said.
Dabbs-Kayser said she will
also try to dress in the fashion o f
the day.
“I’m going to have to pull
something off,” she said.
As part o f the golden
anniversary, the S IU E Alumni
Association organized “ Flashback
to the M RF,” two nights o f music

celebrating the historic concerts
between 1969 and 1980.
“ There’s a large group o f
people that have tremendously
fond memories,” Alumni Affairs
Director Steve Jankowski said.
“ T his event gives them the
opportunity to relive those
m emories.”
Beginning at 6 :3 0 p.m.
Thursday, Sept. 27, and Friday,
Sept. 28, ticket holders can step
into a M eridian
Ballroom
reinvented into the great white
tent, where historic bands
entertained masses o f people on
summer nights o f those years.
The Meridian Ballroom will
have the ceiling draped with
white tent material, and onto it
will
be
projected
tw o
docum entary m ovies o f the
concerts. O n the stage, S IU E
alumnus and K S H E 95 radio
personality Rich Dalton and his
band The Classics will perform
covers o f the groundbreaking
artists o f the time.
The
M ississippi
River
Festival was a joint collaboration
between S IU E and the St. Louis
Symphony Orchestra to provide
sum m er
em ploym ent
for
members o f the orchestra and to
draw attention to the university,
according to the U niversity
Archives Web site.
The concert evolved into a
perform ing arts festival that
combined drama and dance with
classic and contemporary music.
Before dissolving in 1980,
the M E T would have seen artists
such as R od Stewart, The Eagles,
Em erson Lake and Palmer, Bob
D ylan, Jackson Brow ne, The
Guess W ho and Judy Collins.
“ There was a great sense o f
fun on cam pus,” Jankowski said.
“ You knew you could come to
S IU E and see artists you couldn’t

afford to see anywhere else.”
One o f the great attractions
o f the MRF, Jankowski said, was
anyone could buy a $2 ticket and
set a blanket on the lawn, and see
world-renowned acts. In that
tradition, “ Flashback” will allow
people to come in and have a sit
on a blanket, and listen to music
for $2.
Originally, Jankow ski and
other
organizers
scheduled
“ Flashback” to last for one night
only. It was so popular, however,
that tickets for the first date sold
out within hours.
Floyd-Hendey set an alarm
for the exact time the tickets went
on sale - midnight. Five minutes
after m idnight, she secured
tickets for her and her two
children and their significant
others.
“ We used to be able to sit on
the back porch, and hear the
concerts. We lived about two
blocks o ff Main Street, and you
could hear both concerts.”
Jankowski
said
the
organizing com mittee had been
thinking o f adding a second night
o f music, and after the tickets
sold so quickly, decided to run
the concert that Thursday and
Friday.
“All o f that fell right into
place,” Jankowski said. “It just
seemed a perfect thing to do the
next day.”
Tickets for the Friday night
concert went on sale at 8 :3 0 a.m.
M onday at Birger H all, and can
also be purchased online at
siue.edu/alumni/.

M uldoon sent an e-m ail to
several people to access the
Springfield
State
JournalRegister’s Web site and respond
to a poll regarding the plagiarism
allegations against Poshard.
The poll asked whether or
not Poshard should resign over
the
plagiarism
allegations.
M uldoon said he sent an e-mail
asking the people who did not
want the matter to be negatively
influenced to respond “no” to the
poll and invite others to do “ if it
is in your good judgm ent.”
The Sun-Times reported that
Poshard won 3-1 in the poll.
M uldoon said reactions to
the e-mail shocked him.
“I’m amazed that it (has)
been blown out o f proportion,”
M uldoon said. “ To me, it was
sim ply a natural response,
providing som e support to the
presidency and the university.”
M uldoon said he sent the email to support his friend, and
because the validity o f the public
opinion poll concerned him. H e
said he worried the poll would

have an undue influence on the
situation.
M uldoon said Poshard did
not ask him to send the e-mail.
“ I take full responsibility
because I think it was a good
thing to do to show my support,”
M uldoon said. “ It w as my
decision, m y initiative, my
reaction and m y enthusiasm to
provide some support.”
M uldoon said in hindsight,
he would have chosen his words
more carefully.
“ I would’ve rewritten it to
make it absolutely sure that it was
com ing from m e,” M uldoon said.
M uldoon said regardless o f
plagiarism com m ittee’s findings,
he will continue to support
Poshard and his work at SIU .
“ The presidency o f Glenn
Poshard has offered an incredible
hope for the future o f all S IU ,”
M uldoon said.

Hendey also said that classes
considered “academ ic prim e,”
between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m ., till
up quickly, as well as courses that
are specific for a particular major.
Before students may register
on the Web, students must get a
PIN from his or her adviser.
“ Even though with Banner,
students
are
registering
themselves it is still mandatory to
see an adviser.” Hendey said.
“ T h e P IN num ber is that
control.”
M andatory advising will
keep students on track with the
classes thev✓ need to O
graduate.
“ T his is great from an
adviser’s point o f view,” H endey
said. “ Often m ost time was spent
on trying to make schedules
work.”
With the Web registration in
place, students will be able to
w ork out their own classes
around personal preferences and
schedule.
H endey
seem s
positive
about Web advising because it
frees up advisers to strictly advise
and help students.
SI LIE graduate student Ron
M orlen said he feels the
mandator)' advising is not the
m ost responsible approach.
“ Its kind o f d egrad in g,”
Morlen said. “I mean, isn’t it like
saying you aren’t responsible
enough to take care o f your own
education. In that case you
shouldn’t be in school, right?”
M orlen,
who
attended
U niversity o f Illinois for his
undergraduate program , said the
Banner system was already in
place there.
“It (the system) is alm ost

system is not a tim e-cutting
measure.
“ Often
tim es
the
appointments take longer than
before,” Loew r said, “ sim ply
because som etim es it rakes a
while to explain what classes a
student needs to take and why.”
Loewr agrees with Hendey
that it is important that students
continue to meet with advisers
instead o f just registering
themselves without any guidance.
“ Its better because we are
educators,” Loew r said, “ this way
we can better teach students why
they need certain courses and not
focus on fitting a schedule
between (a certain time fram e).”
As far as foreseeing any
problem s,
H endey
seem s
confident in the system.
“ The system is doing what it
is meant to do,” Hendey said.
“It’s the policies governing the
system that causes problems. It is
an autom ated system
that
requires as little intervention as
possible so it will work.”
According
to
H en d ey
overrides in the system were a
m ajor part o f the problem lor fall
“The whole process has been
reviewed,” Hendey said. “ You try
to anticipate what problem s
could be but you can’t; you have
to just experience them.”
The bottom line, as tar as
Hendey is concerned, is to do
things as soon as possible.
“As soon as you get your
P IN number,” H endey said.
“ Students need to register right
away.”

a bit relieved to be able to live like
a normal college freshman.
“ I ’m relived that all the
judgm ents and everything are
over,” Knight said. “ 1 no longer
have to worry that if som eone
sees me they are going to take a
picture. I am in college, I do like
to go out and now I don’t have to
worry about that.”
Knight admits she knew she
would have to alter her behavior
if she became queen, but she
wanted
to
represent
her
hometown.

“ I’ve always lived in Tuscola
and I wanted to represent Tuscola
in a positive way. I had never
really been a pageant person and
I thought it would be a good
experience,” she said. “ But I do
regret it because it’s a petty
reason to lose so
much.
Especially because it was a one­
time deal.”

T-shirts can serve as a freedom of expression
Maybe I do love the way
H aw aiian girls grow their
coconuts ...
Wow. It baffles my mind
how ridiculous som e Americans
have
becom e
a b o u t
______________
censorship.
I
^
recently
had
Y U
.
time to sit and C olu m n ist
ponder on two
recent Alestle
articles: Tony Patrico’s “ Graphic
T-shirts not always appropriate”
and Tom Dehner’s “Colum n on
offensive T-shirts is correct.” It
seems to me that the opinions o f
these two gentlemen are a bit on
the conservative side, so I
thought it was my obligation to
provide
a
fresh
(liberal)
perspective.
Mr. Patrico addresses many
points in his article, one being
that “ there is a time and a place
for those items to be w orn.”
Really? It’s fanny because I was

under the im pression that it was
my right to determine what I
wore in the m orning. O K , you
want to make the case that your
English professor has to look at
your shirt in class - fine. I would
have to respond to his question
by answ ering, “ Yes, I feel
completely com fortable wearing
that shirt in front o f my English
professor.” F or one, it is a
legitimate expression o f my “ o ff color” personality. Two, I don’t
care whether or not he/she likes
m y shirt; they’re there to teach
me English, not fashion. And
three, i f s not a distraction unless
you make it one.
Oh, and not to be rude, but
who really cares what anyone at
Denny’s thinks abou t my clothes?
Straying aw ay from Mr.
Patrico’s conservative bash on my
freedom to express myself, we
move onto Mr. D ehner’s letter.
Excuse m e Mr. Dehner, but I
would just like to let you know

that if you ever approached me
about som ething I was wearing
(that you m ight not agree with),
I m ight listen and politely nod as
you “ confront” m e in public
(which I feel is, in and o f itself,
quite rude), but do you really
think I am going to care what
you - or anyone else - think? N o
offense, but I won’t. Sorry.
I do not feel it is my
obligation to com prom ise my
freedom o f expression (be it
tattoos, T-shirts, dance, etc.) just
because you feel that they are not
appropriate. I am surprised that
you have not yet broken down
the
Student
Experim ental
Theatre O rganization’s doors
claiming indecency. It’s all about
expression; whether or not you
agree is up to you, but
“ confronting” a person in public
about their apparel is quite
ridiculous.
America needs to loosen up.
Yes, A m erica m ay be more

desensitized. Yes, these shirts may
be offensive to som e (though
quite witty and/or funny to
others). A nd yes, this is now an
issue im bedded in S IU E ’s history,
but none o f this is as big a
problem as com prom ising any
American’s freedom o f expression
and/or speech.
A G eneral (yet relevant)
note: In history, the CounterR eform ation censored many
classical statues. M any scholars
today look back on these acts
with much disdain.
Possible
Solu tion :
All
students should be required to
wear school uniform s. (D on’t
worry; I’m laughing, too.)
David Whitacre
Junior

Student upset with content of newspaper
I thoroughly understand that
it is probably really difficult for a
college student to work for a
“New spaper.” Considering that
fact that many probably have a
very heavy class
schedule. I o f

c our s e Letter
understand

£q

because I am a
E d itO r
Theatre M ajo r ______________
and, well, we
give up all o f the time we have to
work on our art. But I don’t
know if that is the sam e case for
the people w ho w ork at the
Alestle.
Today was Septem ber 11th
and I expected to see something
in the paper talking about the
many people w ho lost their lives.
It didn’t even have to be

something big just som e kind o f
memorial to all those who died.
But rather the front page article
was about setting a new record o f
incom ing freshm an, an article
which has appeared in the paper
for the past 5 years that I have
been attending S IU E as we grow
larger each year.
I could understand this story
being on the front page in a slow
news week, however this is not
the day to have a cover like this.
Clearly som ething is up with this
paper. I have always been a firm
believer that a newspaper at a
college level should have very
revealing and insightful articles,
but rather we have articles about
feral cats and w hat S IU E would
be like if it were a musical.
I personally d o not find these

stories captivating and I doubt
the educated students o f this
university are happy with that
either. It may be un heard o f why
not write interesting stories that
uncover truth and things that
actually concern the student body
rather than write something that
is below that o f a H igh School
paper.
There really is not one
person to blame for this because
the staff changes every year, but
clearly som ething is up. Maybe
your adviser doesn’t push you to
ask the tough questions or to
write the articles that really
count. O r maybe your editor is to
blame for letting such crappy
articles
to
be
published.
Personally I am thankful for you
that this paper is free because if

people had to pay, then I am
pretty sure that they wouldn’t.
I
am not trying to truly
offend and I realize that there is a
very good chance that this article
won’t be published. However I
feel it is necessary for you guys to
be informed that you are taking
the easy w ay ou t with your
articles rather than actually
w orking hard and producing
something that matters.

September is upon us, and soon
channel surfers will rejoice as the
fall television season draws near.
Here is the rundown for some
the returning and new prim
shows. Check out alestlelive.com

more

detailed

show

information and reviews.

Premiere

Synopsis
Kelsey Grammer returns to television with “Everybody
Loves Raymond” star Patricia Heaton as local news
anchors in Pittsburgh during the '90s. They
undeniable chemistry on screen like all news
should, but are completely different people once the
cameras turn off.
The flashback comedy entering its third season follows Ted
in his quest to find his soulmate following the engagement
and marriage of his best friend. Ted is helped along the
way by less than serious wingman Barney played by Neil
Patrick Harris. Think “Friends” but with most of the action
taking place in a bar instead of a coffee shop.
Leonard and Sheldon are tw o nerds who live in an
apartment and know everything there is to know about
physics and math and nothing about women. An
attractive girl named Penny moves into the neighboring
apartment and immediately leaves a lasting impression.
Hugh Laurie returns as Dr. Gregory House, and the
season premiere will put House in a position to diagnose
a victim who survived a building collapse without the help
of his diagnostics team. W ith her condition getting worse,
House will rely on a diagnosis provided to him by a janitor
When we last left the Office crew, Jim finally ended his
relationship with Karen to ask Pam out on a date. Ryan has
taken a promotion to corporate, and Michael ends up
back with Jan. There should be plenty of comedy to go
around the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company this season.

Entering its fourth season, "Grey’s” follows five surgeons
from different walks o f life gossiping and falling in love
while working at a hospital. W h o knew there was so
much drama and sex in the emergency room?

Winning on the road

Cougars pick up two GLVC road victories
by Zach Groves

Alestle Reporter
Two more road gam es brought two more
Great Lakes Valley Conference wins for the S IU E
volleyball team.
The Cougars fought through four games to
beat Drury University, 3-1, in Springfield, M o.,
Friday night and battled from being one game
down against N o. 20-ranked Rockhurst University
to take them in four, 3-1, in Kansas City Saturday.
S IU E , according to H ead Coach Todd Gober,
traveled to a hostile environment in both schools,
where the crowds looked to add the pressure to the
no. 15-ranked Cougars.
“ They were jeering us about going to Division
I,” Gober said. “ I think our team is going to have
to fight that this year.”
The C ougars looked to have that fight in them.
In the Rockhurst gam e, six players posted double
digits in kills and sophom ore defender Tiffany
Turner recorded 24 digs.
However, Gober said the team had to work
extra hard to avoid gam e points in gam es two and
three to win the match.
“ It sounds like that in the box score, but it
didn’t feel like that to m e,” G ober said o f any
indication o f a one-sided match.

Women’s soccer drops
weekend matches
Drops to 3-3-1 on season
by Kyle Wiese

Alestle Reporter
The S IU E w om en’s soccer team lost
two gam es this past weekend, dropping
the first Friday against Drury by a score o f
2-0 and the second Sunday against
Rockhurst by a score 2-1.
In gam e one on Friday, the Cougars
out shot Drury 10-4, but never could find
the net as D ru ry goalkeeper Jessie
Sanderson recorded seven saves in die
game.
The first D rury goal came in the 40th
minute by Caitlin Weins and was assisted
by Micah and M andi Little.
According to S IU E Assistant Coach
Kelly D ill, the C o u g ars could not
capitalize on the few chances they had, but
Drury was able to convert theirs.
“ We had a lot o f opportunities but we
didn’t finish,” Dill said. “ We didn’t have
our best game as a whole.”
The C o u gars were not short on
chances to put the ball in the net, as they
got four shots on goal from Katie Yearian.
The Panthers were able to add another
goal in the 75th minute from Kelsy L on g
on an assist from Weins to out the game
out o f reach for the Cougars.

S IU E m oved to 3-2-1 on the season
and 2-1 in Great Lakes Valley Conference
play.
In gam e tw o on Sunday, the C ougars
took another loss against Rockhurst by the
score o f 2-1, in a gam e that did not
resemble Sunday’s game at all.
“O n Sunday, we definitely played a
better gam e, but we just hit the posts a
couple o f times on our shots,” Dill said.
The first goal for Rockhurst came in
the fifth minute o ff o f a header by Chelsey
Schumaker from a corner kick by Katie
Vogt.
“ We ju st had a com m unication
breakdown that allowed them to score,”
Dill said.
The C ougars stayed with Rockhurst
the entire gam e, but allowed another goal
in the 55th minute on a rebound from
Lindsay Ew ert to give Rockhurst a 2-0
lead.
Lauren Bayens booted a long shot
from about 4 0 yards out and Ewert was
there to put the rebound into the net.
“ Their second goal on the rebound
was kind o f a fluke, but that happens,” Dill
said.
The C ougars were able to add their
only goal o f the gam e in the 81st minute

S I U E m atched R ockh urst’s shot
attempts with 10 shots on goal, but they
were not able to tie up the score.
“ Our first goal came from hard work,
and we still kept attacking but we just
couldn’t put the ball in the net,” Dill said.
S IU E is now 3-3-1 on the season and
2-2 in G LV C play. The C ougars will take

New fresh
faces on the
golf course
by Zach Groves

Alestle Reporter
S IU E men’s g o lf will soon welcome two new
faces to help continue the fall season.
The Cougars held tryouts last Monday and
H ead Coach Kyle Viehl picked two players out o f
the eight who tried out to play on the college links.
Viehl will add junior college transfer N ate Sanders,
who earned high rankings while playing for Rend
Lake College, and Aaron H ogan , a freshman.
Viehl said the two golfers will add experience as
well as depth to a currently-shorthanded squad.
“ Last year he played No. 1 at Rend Lake, so I
look for him to be an immediate impact on the
team,” Viehl said o f Sanders.
Junior Tyler Link said he com peted with
Sanders during his Springfield College days and
knows what he can bring to the course.
“ Last year, we went to nationals together and
he performed well,” Link said. “ H e’s go t a good
mental gam e for it. H e’s going to be one o f the best
players on the team.”
H ogan looks to gain experience more than
anything else, according to Viehl.
“ With some work, he can definitely add to our
team and make our team a lot deeper,” Viehl said.
Sophom ore M att Lehl, however, said H ogan
brings good composure to the game.

“ I think right now he’s a solid player,” Lehl
said. “I played with him a couple days ago and I just
liked the way he kind o f handled himself.”
Sanders comes from a Rend Lake program that
is well-known for sending golfers to SIU E . Viehl
said he could not believe a player o f Sanders’ caliber
was trying out to play for a college team.
“I asked N ate what brought him to S IU and
normally if you’re one o f top players, they are
picked up by som e colleges,” Viehl said. “And N ate
just came to S IU on his own and decided he was
going to try out as a walk-in on the team which
surprised me but he likes what the ... program had.”
S IU E competed in the Cougar Classic Sunday
and M onday with six o f the eight players available.
Viehl said freshman David Wilson was out with an
illness and junior Adam Grandidier sat out with an
injury.
Meanwhile, Sanders and H ogan still have to
wait to be cleared by the N C A A Clearinghouse,
which grants access to either Division I or D ivision
II sports depending on academic and athletic
eligibility. Barring any setbacks, the C ougars look
forward to seeing them in the team’s red polos.
“I’m excited to play with these guys and see
what they can do,” Link said.

VOLLEYBALL
from pg. 8
The offensive numbers were
a little more spread out in the
Drury gam e, backed by junior
middle hitter Samantha Schulte’s
21 kills, but fellow junior Kelsey
H ubert said she still saw a loud
op p osin g crow d and overall
tough Panther squad.
“ I think Drury had a big
powerhouse on the outside which
we prepared for and handled very
well,” H ubert said in an e-mail
interview. “ Their blocking was
g o o d . I didn’t notice one
particular aspect o f their game
that w as outstanding, I just
thought they seemed to be solid
all the way across the board.”
Even with the loud fans,
junior setter Mallory Clements
said she and her teammates can
easilv tune them out.
“ We don’t have time to listen
to the crowd,” Clements said.
“ We just kind o f laugh it off,
(like) ‘is that die best thing you
can yell at us?”
The 11-3 C ou gars return
hom e for an extended stay,
starting at 7 p.m . Friday against
the University o f Missouri-Rolla
M iners. They continue their
