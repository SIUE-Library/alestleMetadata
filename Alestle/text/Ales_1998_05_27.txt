The price of summer life in mundane Letters to the editor

carried a .22-caliber p is to l....
One o f the teens told the

Som e people like school. I d o n ’t know any o f those people, but I was actually quite
happy to return to my apartm ent. I ’d spent tw o w eeks at hom e with m y parents and could
slow ly feel my m ind grow ing num b from the lack o f stim uli.
In the beginning, I w as happy to go hom e. It w as a taxing sem ester and I m issed my
loving family, but as the stay lengthened and the m undane o f suburban life set in, I found
Danielle m yself dying to go back to school.
Belton
The days seem ed to creep by. I began to w onder if I’d ever actually do anything ever
again. Soon I w ondered if I ju st dream ed that I ran off to college and lived on cam pus. M aybe I w as in
high school again and it w as another sum m er off. Three m onths o f the m undane filled m y m ind. All
those w asted sum m ers I spent slow ly gaining the extra 401bs I ’m too lazy to get rid o f now and w atching
Sally Jessy Raphael. All those w eeks o f actual m em orizing w hat w ould be on H BO so I could have
som ething to look forw ard to.
Panic w as slow ly setting in as I tried to m ake it through the second week. I began to think I w ould
nev er get back to school. I began to drive my parents crazy and got in a few pointless argum ents w ith
m y boyfriend. I had nothing to do and I was slowly going crazy.
I never realized how bland the suburbs o f north St. L ouis w ere till cam e hom e this sum m er.
E veryday, it w as the same thing: hours and hours o f nothingness. E xcept for the occasional thunderstorm ,
little was disturbed in my neighborhood.
I d id n ’t change clothes m uch at home. I w ore my pajam as all day, my head seem ed perm anently
w rapped up in a scarf. I w as to lazy to even put my contact lenses in as the house seem ed to zap the last
bits o f my self-m otivation.
Every now and then the m em orizes o f the past sem ester w ould haunt me. W hile w atching Young and
the R estless thoughts o f that failing grade ori a Critical T hinking test w ould flash past in my brain o r the
bitter w ords o f an adversary. O uch, ouch, ouch I’d think. R eality w as painful, yet w hen I w as placed back
in th e sanctuary w hich w as my hom e, w here the hugs w ere bountiful and the food was good, I was
longing for the w orld w here I face disappointm ent and struggle.
My fam ily was one o f those fam ilies that no one ever talked about. M y m other stayed at hom e to
raise my sisters and I, my parents w ere m arried to each other, and they w ere and still are extrem ely loving
parents. M y m other w as constantly show ering us with affection and fussing at us at the sam e tim e. But
like all things there w as a price.
In o rder to live in the land o f love and happiness there w ere a few rules. As in, the parents rule and
if you object to it your opinion can and will be announced null and void. I w asn ’t allow ed to date till I
w as eighteen. A nd although I'm technically an adult, I cannot com e and go as 1 please in m y parents
hom e. A s soon as I w alk into the house I becom e my m other and fath e r’s daughter again subject to their
rule, and due to years o f really good brain w ashing by both o f them , I w ould never out rightly defy them .
In other w ords, if they told m e not to do, I d id n ’t do it. I used to alw ays get m ad w hen I’d actually ask
to go to the party instead o f lying and saying I was going to the m ovies, because if my parents objected
to it, I w ouldn’t do it ever. It w as very frustrating for m yself and my sisters.
B ecause o f the totalitarian rule o f my household, it felt strange going back. A s m uch as I love my
fam ily and my life w ith them , I realize that I will probably never truly live there like I have in the past
again. I used to tell my D addy all the tim e that I was never going to leave them and live there forever.
H e ’d alw ays say that it w ouldn’t happen because I w ould eventually w ant to do w hat I w anted to do. He
sensed that I w ould eventually w ant em erse m yself into the w orld and he w as right. I liked m y freedom ,
but it w as a the price o f com fort and norm allacy that I m ay n ever know again. My parents used to have
literally force m e to go back to SIU E to get m e out o f that house. N ow here I was, dying to run from it.
I w as dying to run from the security and love I’d had all my life. It w as the type o f love and stability m ost
people only dream ed o f having, and I had it. A nd now, I w anted to leave it.
I suppose it was going to happen sooner or later, but I am actually far happier w hen I am busy. At
hom e I am not busy, 1 becom e the lazy child I w as before I left hom e. At school, I ’m nice and busy, I’m
the editor, I go to classes, I ’m a student and I feel like I ’m actually gaining know ledge instead o f w eight.
T his sum m er will not be w asted like the past.

like every year the

more, each bigger and
bolder than the last.
From mid-May through
late August over 100 film s w ill be

smoke clears, only 15 or so will be
considered victors, while all the rest will
find new homes, cobwebbed on video

Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck star in the second
end-of-the-world disaster pic “ Armageddon. ”

Armageddon:
Ming Na Wen and Eddie Murphy provide voices
for Disney’s Chinese folk tale “MuIan.”

Johhny Depp and Benicio Del Toro star in Terry
Gilliam’s adaptation o f Hunter S. Thompson's
novel “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. ”

Godzilla:

T he m am m oth lizard m ade his w ay onto U.S.

soil last W ednesday and m ade less than a lion s roar with
a disappointing $55 m illion for the w eekend. This could
be a sign that event m ovies do not guarantee big box
office. “G odzilla” could still have a decent run. The next
big fan boy sci-fi picture starring M ulder and Scully
d o esn’t open for a few w eeks. (O pened M ay 20)

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas:

H unter S.

T hom pson’s hazy sem i-fictional novel spent 20 years
w aiting on the shelf for a visionary like Terry G illiam to
com e along and give it a w hack. W ith a strong cast of
oddballs like Johhny D epp, G ary B usey and Penn Gillete,
and a Vegas backdrop, “F ear” has all the m akings o f a
m odest hit. B ut it m ay be o v ersh a d o w e d by the
aforem entioned lizard. (O pened M ay 22)

Hope Floats:

Sandra B ullock returns to the screen

after last y e a r’s dism al “S peed 2 ” in a m uch sm aller film .
T he rom antic com edy costars H arry C onnick Jr. and G ena
Row lands. (M ay 29)

The Truman Show: Jim C arrey returns in a high
concept dram a about a grow n m an w ho learns that his
entire life has been one giant TV show. T his is a departure
from w acky face-m aking com edy for C arrey, b ut the buzz
(early O scar talk) on this film is huge. (June 5)
6 Days, 7 Nights: H arrison Ford is back in a rom antic
action-com edy w ith costar A nne H eche. (June 12)
The X-Files: T he w ait is over for fan boys and girls
alike. D avid Duchovny, G illian A nderson and m uch o f the
cast o f the television show reprise th eir roles in the big
screen conspiracy-laden adventure. T he film takes off
w here last season left off and leaves view ers w aiting for
the season debut in Septem ber. (June 19)
Dr. Dolittle: A fter scoring big w ith “T he N utty
P rofessor” tw o years ago, E ddie M urphy rem akes another
kiddie classic. This one has Eddie playing the straight man
to a b unch o f anim als w ith the voices o f C hris R ock and
Jay M ohr. (June 26)
Out of Sight: Elm ore L eonard’s crim e love tale hits the
celluloid thanks to “sex, lies and videotape” auteur Steven
Soderburgh. T he caper stars G eorge C looney, Jennifer
L opez, D ennis Farina and Ving R ham es. (June 26)
Mulan: D isney’s annual anim ation event m ovie is a
beautifully painted C hinese folk story about a young
girl w ho goes to w ar so her aged father can stay at
hom e. E ddie M urphy and M ing-N a W en provide voices.
(June 19)

T h e last tw o Independence D ays have
seen those y e a r’s b iggest hits, and D isney is banking on
that for its end-of-the-w orld-as-w e-know -it d isaster pic.
T he a ll-sta r ca st in c lu d es B ru ce W illis, B illy B ob
T hornton, Ben A ffleck, Liv Tyler and Steve B uscem i. This
m ovie is alm o st a sure thing, but after “D eep Im p act,” will
audiences be tired o f com et/asteroid pictures? (July 1)

Lethal Weapon 4:

Mel G ibson reportedly got $20

m illion to star in th is installm ent o f the action com edy
series. T he series is successful, b ut No. 4 is usually box
office sequel poison. Perhaps co-star Chris R ock can
breathe life into the series, how ever. (July 10)

Small Soldiers:

July does not have m uch kiddie fare,

so this special effects packed film should do w ell. It
involves a group o f toys that are im planted w ith a
g overnm ent m icrochip. Tom m y Lee Jones voices the head
toy soldier. (July 10)

My Favorite Martian:

O ne o f the tw o T V show

rem akes fo r the sum m er season is this com edy from
Disney. T he trouble is, does anyone rem em ber the show
that starred R ay W alston that w ill buy a m ovie ticket?

The Mask of Zorro:

The preview to this action film

show s plenty o f gusto, but the last m ovie that had vivid
sw ordplay w as the disastrous “C utthroat Island.” It stars
A ntonio B anderas and A nthony H opkins. (July 17)

Saving Private Ryan:

Steven Spielberg d irected this

W orld W ar II film that stars m any A -list actors including
Tom H anks, M att D am on and E dw ard B um s. (July 24)

BASEketball:
