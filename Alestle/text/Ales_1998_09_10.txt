SIUE has zero tolerance for sexual harassment
BY ALONA THOMPSON
NEWS STRINGER
Sexual harassment has been
a huge issue in the ’90s. From
high-ranking
politicos
in
governm ent offices to young
children on school playgrounds,
it seems that no group is exempt
from accusation.
Sexual harassment can also
be found on college campuses.
The definition of sexual
harassment differs from person to
person but at Southern Illinois
University Edwardsville, sexual

harassment means an unwelcome
sexual advance, request for a
sexual favor or other verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual
nature.
SIUE is a zero-tolerance
university when it comes to
sexual harassment.
“Once a year we affirm our
comm itments and notify the
community and university about
the sexual harassment policy,”
said Paul Pitts, assistant to the
chancellor for equal opportunity
programs.
“Anything that is said or
done that makes a person feel

uncomfortable is an example of
sexual harassment,” sophomore
Nia Ross-Howard said.
As stated in the Faculty
Handbook, SIUE seeks to
m aintain an environm ent for
teaching, learning and service
that is safe, humane, enlightened,
supportive and stimulating.
“I have never personally
been
sexually
harassed,”
sophomore Treanna Kemey said.
“But I know someone who was
almost raped because the guy she
was with thought she was
sending him the wrong signals
and became very aggressive and
did not know when to stop.”

Chancellor David Warner
reaffirmed the university’s fight
against sexual harassment in a
campus-wide memo last month.
The memo included information
on reporting complaints.
The bulletin states that student
complaints of sexual harassment
should be directed to Rudy Wilson
or Liz Tarpey in the office of the
assistant provost for cultural and
social diversity, Room 3110 in
Rendleman Hall.
Employee complaints of
sexual harassment should be
directed to Pitts in the office of
equal
opportunity,
also
in
Rendleman Hall.

“The student complaints and
employee complaints are separated
to decentralize the process,” Pitts
said. “This way each office will
have a unique way to address each
complaint.”
Confidentiality of all parties
involved in a sexual harassment
charge will be supported as long as
it does not interfere with the
university’s legal obligation to
investigate
allegations
of
misconduct. If claims are brought
to the university’s attention, the
school will take appropriate action,
officials said.

Five best campus spots
to catch quick 40 winks
BY JIM DALTON
LIFESTYLE STRINGER

Bob FehringerM/esr/e

Sophomore Kelly Roberts takes a nap in the Opapi Lounge in the University Center. It ’s
one o f the many places students find to take naps between classes.

You are lounging in the last
row of a warm, congested
classroom. Outside, the sky is an
overcast jum ble of dark grays
and blues which perm it only
scattered bits of light to enter the
dim room. As the pitter-patter of
rain taps on the roof, your eyelids
begin to droop and you sink into
your desk. Your old, stuffy
professor drones on incessantly
in a lazy, m onotone voice.
Slowly, that voice starts to float
away and the class fades into a
distant, hazy realm. Unable to
resist the powers of the sandman,
you peacefully lay your head on

the desk and enter a world of
restful bliss.
Nearly all of us can relate to
this. Sometimes, you just need a
little nap to get through the day.
Personally, I ’d like to see a
designated cam pus-w ide nap
time just like we use to have in
kindergarten. Unfortunately, our
chancellor doesn’t see eye to eye
with me on this issue.
The following is a list of the
best places to sleep if you happen
to be stuck here on campus.
Maybe you’ll have a better idea
of which direction to stagger in
the next time your eyes are
begging to be shut.

New program at university recognizes outstanding workers
BY TONY WATT
NEWS STRINGER
Outstanding staff and civil
service w orkers are being
honored through a new program.
SIUE recently established
the
Em ployee
Recognition
Award, a monthly citation given
to an exemplary employee along
with a choice of small prizes.
"The
adm inistration
realized that a lot of work was
getting done by dedicated staff
who enjoy w orking for the
university,” said Shrylene Clark,
a training and developm ent

specialist
w ith
U niversity
Personnel Services. “They work
extra hours and work late. This
is an attem pt to give them
recognition.”
Each m onth departm ent
heads
nom inate
several
candidates. A committee gives
each nominee points from six
different categories and the
candidate with the most points
wins. The com m ittee is made up
of four people who are ineligible
for the award. They include
G loria A tkins, chair o f the
committee and a representative
of the vice chancellor’s office of

administration; Lora Flamm of
the vice chancellor’s office of
student affairs; Rudy Wilson of
the vice chancellor’s office of
the provost and academic affairs;
and Keith Nichols of the vice
chancellor’s
office
for
development and public affairs.
The award is given during
the Staff Senate m eeting on the
first Thursday of every month in
the Delyte W. M orris University
Center.
The winner o f Septem ber’s
Employee Recognition Award is
Joyce Toom bs, adm inistrative
secretary in the Admissions and

Records D epartm ent. Christa
Oxford, assistant vice chancellor
for Enrollm ent M anagem ent,
nominated Toombs.
“She
is
absolutely
outstanding,” said Oxford, who
nominated Toombs for her help
in
coordinating
several
renovation
projects
in
A dm issions
and
Records.
“Thanks
to
Joyce,
the
obstructions were minimal and
transparent to our users.”
Toombs, who has been with
the university since 1983,
received a plaque and a $25 gift
certificate to the U niversity

Center Bookstore
”1 am
very
pleased,”
Toombs said. “It m akes me
happy to know that people care
and appreciate the work I do.”
The Employee Recognition
Award was announced in April
in a memo from A. G. Monaco,
director of Human Affairs
The first award was given in
July to Janet Novosad from the
M anagement Departm ent o f the
School of B usiness. A ugust’s
recipient was M ichele Albert,
purchasing assistant in the
Procurem ent,
Storage
and
Supply Office.

Top Five Places to Sleep
1) The Library: The second and third floors of the Lovejoy
Library are the ideal sleep spots on campus. There are little
“study” areas, though I have yet to see someone actually
study here, equipped with cushy chairs and sofas. Because
the library is always quiet, your sleep won’t be interrupted
by any loud or sudden noises.

4) The Fitness Center: The Fitness Center has newly
reupholstered furniture. Free of dried soda spills, the
benches in the Fitness Center have a clean smell like clothes
just out of the drier. In the morning and afternoon, the gym
doesn’t have the mobs of people like the classroom
buildings.
5) Class: I think the university could make a great deal of
money if someone would record some professors’ lectures
and sell them as cures for insomnia. It could be an audio
tape series that you play at night when you can’t fall asleep.
Never again would some unfortunate souls have to endure
a sleepless night.
Sleeping in class is best only if used very sparingly.
People who sleep in class every day should just stay in bed.
However, occasionally nodding off is all right. Chances are
that you won’t miss anything important.

second floor of the University Center is virtually unknown
to students. However, one must be careful while attempting
to catch a few winks. There’s an unwritten rule that this area
is reserved for faculty and staff naps only. Don’t be
surprised if a groggy professor asks you to move aside.
A more well-known sleep station is the Opapi study
lounge. Unlike the library, I actually witnessed people
studying here. There are plenty of couches and chairs, but
they’re always littered with trash. Be sure to brush off the
crumbs, candy wrappers and soda cans before you lie down.
3) Alumni and Founders Hall Benches: The benches in
these buildings lack the softness and all-around comfort of
those in the library and UC. Also, sleeping in the buildings
can be difficult when large herds of noisy students are
marching by. Despite the ripped-up, rock-hard benches and
the 200-decibel noise level, many students manage to sleep
here. One advantage is the close proximity to your
classroom. You can awaken a mere 30 seconds before class,

three percent increase would
make a world of difference to
someone making $20,000 versus
your adm inistrator’s salary of
probably three or four times
more. (Have you tried recently to
raise a family on approximately
$20,000? I’m sure some of the
building workers have.) Also, the
University fails to recognize that
while every year workers may be
given a three percent increase,
the University also takes away
most o f that increase by
increasing fees for insurance,
parking lot stickers, etc. Is most
of your three percent increase
spent on additional fees that the
University or state imposes?
Since you’re probably making
three to four times more than the
building workers, probably not.
Finally, I find it an insult that
you feel justified in taking
advantage of building workers
simply because, as the Alestle
quotes you as saying, building
service workers in St. Louis area
only make minimum wage. Even
if your facts are correct,
shouldn’t the University be more
progressive? Shouldn’t we want
to better the conditions for people
around us? Or, as a University, do
we just want to talk about
bettering
society
in
the
classrooms and not practice what
we preach outside the classroom?
Also, if-another building worker
at a comparable university(e.g.,
Carbondale) is paid more money
for exactly the same job, why
shouldn’t SIUE building workers
be untitled to equity pay? If this
equity involved the faculty, I can
be almost 100% sure that you
wouldn’t be making such a fuss
over it.

Stop the whining and
start the support
Perhaps if people would stop
whining about not having a
football team at SIUE, they could
find time to attend a soccer game
or two. Face it, folks, if you do
not support a soccer team that
won nearly 90% of its matches
last fall, it is implausible to think
that you would support a gridiron
team that would likely lose 90%
of its games the first few years.
M ost students— including
myself—complain about all the
student fees. Attendance at SIUE
athletic events is FREE— yet
virtually nobody shows up!
What do you people want?
From Don Ebert to Joe
Reiniger to Darren Snyder, SIUE
has sent its best players to both
the indoor St. Louis Steamers and
St. Louis Ambush. It is a shame
that the best soccer Cougars have
to wait to be drafted before they
can play before more than a few
dozen fans.

Mr. Neher, please give the
building workers the respect they
deserve. Do not discuss them in a
condescending way. Remember,
they are just doing their jobs, like
you are trying to do yours, in
order to support themselves and
their families; however, they are
earning a whole heck of a lot less
money.

■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
cstulce@siue.edu
Is there an operation that can
be performed by someone like
Dr. Mengale, the Nazi angel of
Death butcher surgeon, to
remove the deep-seated morals
in my brain?
You see, I keep getting myself
into these awkward sexual
situations with friends, and if my
morals were scraped from my
think-box, I would have no
worries, no evil, arousing
thoughts to keep me pondering
into the late hours.
Yeah, it’s a bad habit, but I’m
of the belief that one should do
whatever feels good, as long as
one isn’t hurting another person
(too deeply) in the process. Of
course, if the one I’m hurting is
myself, well isn’t that all the
better. A little sexual torture
never scarred anyone too deeply,
except for maybe M adonna. (I
hear those trenches are dug damn
near to China)
So, where should one draw
the line between friends and
friends who get a little naughty?
Is a kiss too much? A deep, wet,
tongue-wrestling match? Perhaps
a little fingers on flesh? Maybe
just a tickle or two? W here
should it stop?
Unfortunately, I’m slowly
becoming an alcoholic. T here’s
nothing like a night of hard
booze, sweaty dancing and
waking up half-naked in the bed
of a poker buddy to really make
you re-examine your lifestyle.
It’s not that I feel completely
guilty about what’s been
happening, but I’m starting to
run out of people to talk to about
these trysts. This has been a
problem for me since high
school.

Coming-of-cige-stories
are
becoming old hat fo r 14-year-old
actor Joseph M dzzello. H e ’s
played an abused child in “Radio
Flyer, ” a boy with AID S in “The
Cure" and was chased by
com puterized dinosaurs and
almost electrocuted in “Jurassic
Park. ”
In his latest film , “Simon
Birch, ” Mazzello is still coming
o f age, this time trying to fin d his
identity, as well as helping his
diminutive best pal become a
miracle.
Mazzello has become a fine
dram atic actor, and while
puberty may fin d him a bit
awkward, chances are he won't
end up like other form er child
actors.
He carries him self in a mature
manner and is willing to admit
that a strong and close fam ily

background has not let him
become too “Hollywood. ”
How did you force yourself
to cry on camera?
Well, 1 d o n 't really force
myself. It just kind of happens.
My acting comes from the heart,
and my dad once told me to make
it real, and I live by that advice. I
can do an emotional scene by
getting into the character and
feeling what he feels. It just
comes out.
What do you think makes a
hero?
Heroes can be anybody. They
save a life or they invent
something.
Did you develop an offscreen
friendship with co-star Ian
Michael Smith?
Yeah,
we
becam e
like
brothers. We did a lot of things
together. We played games and
things. We shot in a lot of small

Joseph MaZzello and Ian Michael Smith star in the film
“Simon Birch.”

towns in Canada, so we really
only had each other.
Did you find it difficult to
ask about his condition? (Smith
has Morquio Syndrome, a type
of dwarfism.)
I never did. I heard about it
from other people. I don't think it
was anything we really needed to
talk about. I would play with him
sometimes and his dad would be
around and say, “Joe, be careful.”
I heard that you were
interested in directing. What
was the most important thing
you learned about directing
from Steven Spielberg?
Actually, a lot of my wanting
to be a director came from
Richard Donner. That [“Radio
Flyer”] was my first big movie
where I worked a lot on it, and
Richard Donner helped me a lot
with the basics. And then on
“Jurassic Park,” Steven Speilberg
would pull me out of class
sometimes to show me how he
was setting the shots and how
everything was going to be set
up. He told me about the camera.
He was really helpful.
Do you think good roles for
young actors are scarce right
now?
Around my age they are.
What is your ideal role?
I’m really big into baseball.
I've always wanted to do a
baseball movie. I would have to
co-star with some gorgeous
woman.
Do you think you would ever
take a role in one of those teen­
ager slasher movies that are so
popular?
I don't know. Some of those
movies are just disgusting.
How do you approach

getting into a character after
you get the script?
I read it a couple times. And
after awhile you put your own
input into a character. You think,
it can be interpreted a couple
ways, how would I interpret it.
Do you consider yourself a
method actor? Do you get
totally into the character?
I'm not a method actor. Not by
far. I can go onto the set all
cheery and once they said
“Action,” I got totally into the
character. One tim e Mark
Johnson asked me “Where do
you go when you do a scene?
Where do you go?” And I just
said, “I'm right here.”
What other actors do you
admire?
Well, he’s an old actor, but
Jimmy Stewart. I like him
because, if I could have a career
like his, I’d be pretty happy.
Speaking of Jimmy Stewart.
I read that you like “It’s A
Wonderful Life.” That's my alltime favorite.
Mine too.
So, what do you like about
the movie?
I really believed in all the
characters and his struggle to get
out because he didn’t want to stay
in the same town all his life. My
favorite line in the movie when
Harry says, “To my big brother
George, the richest man in town.”
That just says so much.
Do you think you’d like to go
to film school someday?
I don’t know how important
film school is. I mean, Steven
Spielberg never went to film
school. But, yeah, I’m thinking of
it.

ate Tanning E xperience

I guess it’s the closeness I feel
with my friends that allows me
to want to get closer to them
physically.
I’ll be graduating soon, and
college is w here som eone
doesn’t get judged very harshly
for a little experimentation.. So
I ’ll have to start behaving
myself. I guess I d o n ’t have to
have six or seven Long Island
Teas on a night out with the
pals. But I will be planning one
hell of an orgy the night before
I graduate. Invitation only. And
my morals w on’t be getting any
invitation.

those was th e N ew Y ork

You know it is a good
baseball year w hen a team
th at m ight win m o re gam es
in a single season th a n any
o th er is receiving less press
than the N ew York Jets.

Also contrary to belief,

A nd if you h a v e n ’t
heard M ark M cG w ire hit
his 62nd hom e run.

W here were you when ...
For years the question was “W here
w ere you w hen P resident K ennedy was
sh o t?” o r "W here w ere you when Dr.
King was assassinated?” The question
ou r generation will answ er is “W here
were you when M ark M cG w ire hit No.
62?” Some m ay argue th a t the lives and
therefo re the d eaths of John F. K ennedy
and M artin L u ther King, Jr. changed the
lives of a nation and c an 't be com pared
to a record of sport.
Sure, in the grand schem e of our
national history, JF K and M LK are
m ore im p o rtant th an M ark M cGw ire;
b u t from a p e rso n al sta n d p o in t our

national pastim e has affected me like no
o th e r sport. I can rem em ber as a child
no m ore th an six years old carrying
hom e a tro p h y my dad had w on at a fastpitch softball to u rnam ent. W hen I was in
grade school my dad was the coach and
to this day we still tell stories of when
B obby V anD illen forgot to bring his
glove to practice and then w anted to
play in th e outfield so he w ouldn’t get
his new w hite shoes dirty.
A s I b ec am e a te e n -a g e r the
ev ery d ay lig h t-h e a rte d c o n v ersa tio n s
betw een my dad and m e w ere h ard to
com e by. I was dealing with new ideas of

freedom and independence and my dad
was dealing with raising his first boy.
Yet, I can rem em b er those aw kw ard
silences in the car being b ro k en by the
sm ooth voice of Jack Buck on the radio.
It m ay not have b ee n th e m o st
m eaningful conversations we ev er had,
b u t we could always talk a b o u t the
gam e.
M y fam ily and I still go to my parish
picnic and as the night goes on an d the
boasting gets louder, you can find my
dad

In S unday’s con test against M ercyhurst College, SIU E once
again show ed how its defense can shut a team dow n.T he Cougars
evened th eir record at 1-1 with a 1-0 win o v er M ercyhurst.
Senior M att L ittle took care of the offense as he tallied his first
goal of the season in the 67th m inute.
G o alk eep er Chris Koenig m ade four saves while picking up
the sh uto ut for SIU E.
“Chris played with a lot o f confidence an d o u r defenders were
like a brick wall,” H un ek e said. “It was great to get a win against
a highly reg ard ed team . I was im pressed w ith o u r ability to
contain M ercyhurst’s relentless offensive p ressu re.”
H uneke was surprised to see his young players play so well
against a pair of tough teams.
“C ress M addox, along with a num ber of o u r new players, really
stepped up fo r us,” H u neke said. “I t’s nice to see o u r young guys
play so solid considering how com petitive this to u rn am en t was.”

A s my dad and I have grow n older, we have becom e closer. We

For a little m ore th an an ho u r we talk ed a b o u t w hat we w ould
do if we caught the ball, why I flip back an d forth betw een
channels so o ften and laughed about countless o th e r things. But
at 8:18 p.m., a fter an evening of n o n sto p conversation, M ark
M cG w ire sw ung his way into baseball im m ortality and n o t a

us talking all those years had now re n d e re d us speechless. We just
sat and stare d at the T V n e ith e r of us w anting to ruin the
m om ent. It was the best silence my dad and I have ever shared.
W here was I w hen the record was b ro k e n ? I ’ll never forget.
