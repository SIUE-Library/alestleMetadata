Ballroom this weekend.

The music of eastern Europe
comes to the campus as the St.
Petersburg String Quartet visits
SIUE Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday as part of the 1998 Arts
and Issues Series.
Formed
in
1985
by
Leningrad Conservatory alumni
and originally named for that
city, the quartei quickly gained
recognition and success through

its interpretations of works by
Shostakovich and other Russian
composers. In 1991, an extensive
world tour began just as the city
and quartet’s appellation changed
to “St. Petersburg.”
The
acclaim ed
quartet,

to perform and give clinics at
festivals and universities.
The St. Petersburg Quartet

special coaching session of SIUE
chamber music groups Tuesday.
Students will perform for the
guests and receive instruction

The obsessive pursuit of
sports in the black community
has contributed to the downfall of
black society and will ultimately
effect all of society, according to
a California professor.
Dr. Harry Edwards of the
University o f C alifornia at
Berkeley is an East St. Louis
native, and an authority in the
sociology of sports and race
relations.
Edwards spoke to about 75
students, faculty and sociologists
at a conference Friday at the
SIUE East St. Louis Center
Auditorium. The conference was
sponsored
by
the
Illinois
Sociological A ssociation, the
SIUE College of Arts and
Sciences, the SIU E office of
social and cultural diversity, the
M idwest Sociological Society
and the SIUE departm ent of

The fences around the arena
where the horses are kept also
need a new coat of paint, but “the
biggest job will be getting the
trees in the ground.”
The Kim m el Leadership
Center and the office of the vice
chancellor for student affairs are
sponsoring
the
volunteer
opportunity and Beverly Farm
can benefit financially from the
volunteer program . Beverly
Farm has applied for a grant
offered through U SA Today’s
“M ake a D ifference D ay”
program. The SIUE volunteer
program will be reviewed by the
magazine on the basis of how
many volunteers participated, the
nonprofit
organization
that
benefited from volunteer efforts
and the type o f work volunteers

accomplished.
“I would like to see at least
100 students volunteering,”
Mark said. “We have also applied
for a Newman’s Own grant for
this SIUE volunteer project.”
Beverly Farm could receive a
$10,000
grant
from

organization if the volunteer
project is judged to be successful.
Lunch and transportation to

said.
He said the tragic results of
this singular pursuit of sports
fame are the underdevelopment
of the personal and cultural
aspects of black society and the
elim ination o f support, role
models and infrastructure for
other pursuits for young black
males.
“Complex critical problems
for black families have caused
them to push children to sports,”
Edwards said.
Some of the reasons for this
include “the long-standing idea
of black superiority in athletics”
and “the lack o f role models in
other functions of society,” he
said.
Edwards reflected on the
social gains fought for by the
activism of the black athletes in
the ‘60s, including the protest of
the 1968 Olympics in Mexico
City which he helped organize.
He said he thinks many of today’s
athletes take those gains for
granted.
“What will be the enduring
legacy of those demonstrations?”
Edwards asked. “M uhammed
Ali, Arthur Ashe, Curt Flood, all

those great athletes fought the
battle in the ‘60s and set the table
that the M ichael Jordans and
others dine at today.”
Edwards said the “personal
conversions” experienced by
athletes who fought for equality
have been replaced by the “self­
absorption” o f today’s athletes.
“Time,
progress,
com placency
and
political
expediency tend to erode the
urgency o f issues,” Edwards said.
“Those issues tend to be
diminished.”
Edwards said while sports
has been the downfall, it can also
be the savior but only if woven
into a framework of community,
spiritual and institutional support
in black society.
“Sports programs may be the
last handholds and toeholds on
our youth to get them back,”
Edwards said.
“We should pursue it and use
it as a solid beginning. Much is to
be learned and gained from the
challenge of sports competition,
but we must dream with our eyes
open and realize the pitfalls.
Sports shouldn’t become an
obsession, but part of the overall
picture.”

Letter to the Editor
Alestle needs more
quality control
The Alestle’s content quality
is on the decline. Particularly in
the area of Op-Ed. Fix it now by
providing true opinion and
commentary in the various
editorial sections of your paper.
In the previous 3-4 weeks we
have been regaled with Cory
Stulce’s sex life; have been
provided opinion regarding
Danielle Beltons’ hairdos, her
lack of enthusiasm for Hilfiger
wear, and the fact that she takes
pride in coasting through school.
These topics are inane to the
point of boredom. The recent
Tommy Chong review was a
classic as it was simultaneously
sexist, racist, and vulgar in a
single paragraph.
“W here’s the beef?” What is
the Alestle’s position or opinion
on the presidential scandal? What
is their opinion on the supposed
corruption of Senator Carol
M oseley-Braun? Will recent
SIUE demographics, that show
the university gaining more
female students to male students,
affect the athletic departm ent
under Title IX legislation? What
is the paper’s opinion on the lack
of a criminal justice program at
SIUE? Why is so much St. Louis
expansion
westward
vice
eastward? Should we at SIUE
care about this expansion? Is
“surfing the web” a worthwhile
activity, or is it simply watching
TV repackaged? Read some
other campus Op-Ed’s to prime
the pump on what really irks you.
O prah’s weight loss/gain/loss
can’t be the only thing we care
about!
This is not a total complaint
letter. Now that you are more
fully staffed, the papers’ overall
article quality has improved from
this past summer. The stringer
and reporting articles have

improved dram atically. They
cover some important issues: OpEd pieces could be nurtured from
these headlines. I think that’s
how the Pulitzers do it. Also,
copy editing is way up! Good
work there.

Football SIUE’s missing
ingredient
Like many students here at
SIUE I am rather capable of
finding something to do, when I
desire. With such activities as
listening to concerts on the quad,
working out at the Vadalabene
Center, or just relaxing in the
University Center, there are just
not many instances of not having
anything to do. Even so, after
spending a little bit of time at
other campuses, it became
evident that there is one big event
in particular that is missing there
at SIUE. Yes, football. I know
that there have been many pleas
pertaining to the need of a
football team, but shouldn’t that
be a huge sign o f what the
students truly want?
Having a football team adds
a plethora of events to organize,
attend, and enjoy; not to mention
a
more
recognizable
homecoming event (sorry, soccer
players and fans).
Seriously
though, our school has collected
more than $500,000 in parking
tickets, and then spent $600,000
on the expansion o f the already
present weight room o f the
Vadalabene Center. I am aware
that the parking ticket revenue
does not apply to recreational
activities already available.
Obviously the m oney is
there, the student body wants it,

and it would obviously benefit
the school; so why the hesitation?
I know that this will not be the
last of the missing football team
letters, but hopefully someone
out there with the pow er is
listening to what the students
body indeed wants.
Daphine Rock
B u sin ess A d m in istra tio n

Half a Million Dollars?
What? Here is an idea, lower
the price of the parking tickets. I
can go to St. Louis and get a
parking ticket at a meter and it
will only cost me $5. Here a
ticket at a meter will cost $10 and
I know I am having much more
fun in St. Louis.
I understand that the meter
maids are trying to teach us a
lesson about parking where we
are supposed to park, but please,
give us a break. If I put enough
money in a meter to go inside and
do what 1 need to do, there is a 99
percent chance that I will run into
a professor who will talk to me
long enough that my time on my
meter will run out. I will get a
ticket. Then what am I suppose to
do, force my professor to pay for
it? I don’t think so, unless I want
to fail my classes this semester.
I know that lowering the
price of thé parking tickets would
mean less revenue, but I have a
solution for that. They can fire
some o f the parking agents
because Lord knows we do not
need seven o f them runiyng
around campus. I vote that they
keep the one that I saw sleeping
in his SIUE mobile in the Cougar
Village Rec lot. I know he will
not be a problem for us.

In Ralph Ellison’s novel, “Invisible Man,” the
nameless male character wanders through 1920s America
searching for an identity. In this journey, he seeks to
abandon his roots but is unable to forget his heritage. He
continuously tries to bond with people like himself but
ends up feeling jaded, disappointed and lost. He eventually
becomes a recluse, retiring to a dark hole. Throughout this
noyel, he meets adults who aren’t what they appear to be.
They are black as he is and are trying to survive in the same
racist society, but when trouble comes, a him-or-me attitude develops
and the weakest link (the main character) is sacrificed.
After reading this novel for the second time, I was able to draw
the parallels between Ellison’s novel and the problem with many
young African-Americans today and their relations with their baby
boomer elders. Many young African-Americans are often
misunderstood by their elders. While some of us do not know our
history or always give it the respect it deserves, many of us do know
o.ur heritage, and we are tired of being treated as a member of a
collective rather than as an individual.
Recently, I was a judge for awards presented by the St. Louis
Association of Black Journalists. I was very honored to be asked, but
from the minute I got there, I knew I was not like the other judges. I
was the youngest person there. Everyone was 30 or older. No one
spoke to me except for a man who sat next to me, and I believe he only
spoke because he had an affinity for young women. I was one of two
young women there. I was ordered to help sort contest entries. Then, I
was told to get my own drink after the woman in charge had politely
gotten everyone else’s. I didn’t expect the woman to serve me, but I
was a judge like everyone else in the room. Why was I treated so
differently?
The woman who ordered me around said it very firmly and
sweetly at the same time: “I don't get stuff for young people. I'm mean
to young people; you can get it yourself.”
Maybe she was right, but I was there as a judge and in this room
we were all supposed to be equals, so why was I the judge sorting
papers?
Perhaps my fellow judges had bought into that same rhetoric my
peers and I have been hearing since the ‘80s. So many, many times I
have been told that my generation is lost, but who lost it? I have been
told that my generation is violent, ignorant and has little chance for
survival. And I hear this from my elders. And I hear every girl is
pregnant and every boy is in a g a n g . A n d , it m y generation does
try to make progress, we are reminded that we don't know what we are
talking about and have not paid our dues.
I continually meet black adults who talk to me as if I am a child
and look at me as if I was an impostor when 1 participate in their
causes. I will admit that I do not have the life experience they do, but
that does not mean I cannot think and that we cannot learn from each
other. Often I am looked at not as an individual but as part of a
collective that must be criticized and controlled. Adults automatically
assume I am ignorant about my cultural history without even speaking
to me.
Often I am searching for elders who will embrace me and want to
help, and sometimes I do find these mentors. Yet I’ve also met people
out for their own personal gain and preservation. If I get stepped on in
the process or if I get used, that isn’t their problem. They look at me
and think 1 need to learn from my own mistakes, even if it could lead
to my undoing.
Many national organizations often beg for young blacks to
become involved but don’t want to listen to them once they have been
recruited. Then after the few who have been recruited leave, the
organizations accuse them of being lazy and lacking the intelligence to
succeed in such an organization. I am often told that I am the type of
young person organizations want, but I end up being asked to be seen,
not heard. If the elders during the movements in the 1960s had that
attitude, nothing would have ever been accomplished.
I am not saying the lack of involvement between young AfricanAmericans and their elders is entirely the adults' fault. Many young
African-Americans are in denial about race relations and live with a
false sense of security about our society. Many are very ignorant about
their culture and lack the motivation to continue the movements of the
past. But who was responsible for teaching that culture? Who was
responsible for keeping the issues of the past from being forgotten?
Somewhere along the way the young and the old of the AfricanAmerican community have stopped talking to each other. There is a
serious communication problem that is often ignored. Why is it that
many black people my age feel as if they can’t relate or speak to their
elders? Why is it that so many elders believe the stereotype of the
young, troublesome black teen or young adult? Why do the young
discredit the movements of the past? Why are we so out of touch with
each other?
I hope a dialogue will start soon between the young and the old
where respect will be given to all regardless of their age. My
generation cannot end up like the main character in Ellison’s novel.
The end for my generation, for any generation, cannot be a nation of
angry, disgruntled and apathetic people dismissing our history because
of the treachery of others.

Costume brawl for free tickets
If yo u ’re looking for something scary or even m ildly
entertaining to do in celebration of the upcoming Halloween
night, show up at the Alestle office on the second floor of the
UC at 12:30 p.m . tomorrow in full costume. If we like your
threads for any reason at all, you’ll walk away with a p air of
tickets to the Darkness Haunted Theme Park, Silo X or Terror
Visions 3-D.

BY TRAVIS KNUCOLLS
L IF E S T Y L E S T R IN G E R

Come one, come all! See the bizarre,
twisted creatures of M other Nature’s sick sense
of humor. Yes siree, the freak shows are coming
to town. Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Gwar
and Insane Clown Posse are on a road trip and
the next stop is ju st a few minutes away in St.
Louis — just in tim e for Halloween.
The first freak submitted for your viewing
pleasure is Mr. Hellbilly himself, Rob Zombie.
On O ctober 19, Zom bie brought his own
special brand o f weirdness to the American
Theater. Fans came dressed to kill for this
concert; it was a costume party. Tickets for this
show were $25 plus surcharge.
Next is the super-freak turned super-diva,
Marilyn Manson. The anti-man is bringing his
“Mechanical Animals” to the Fox Theatre on
October 27. Tickets for this show are the same
price as for Zom bie’s.
Last on the roster is a combined concert of
two lesser-known but equally strange bands,
Gwar and Insane Clown Posse. This bizarre
concert takes place at the American Theatre
October 31.
None of these concerts are at your typical
venues. None o f these performers are your
typical bands, either. Zombie and his entire
band look like walking corpses from “Night of
the Living D ead” on stage. Manson and his
band are generally clad in leather and fishnet,
but with this new makeover, the pseudo-sexy
leader m ight have changed the whole

appearance of his show. Still, bet on much
weirdness from the Antichrist Superstar. Gwar
has an interesting appearance on stage, wearing
costumes that look like a mixture o f demon
limbs and medieval armor. ICP looks like close
relatives to the evil clown in Stephen King’s
horror novel-made-television movie, “It.”
Each concert has its own twist for show and
all with the exception of ICP are heavy metal.
ICP is a cross between heavy metal and rap. At
the very least, attendance at one o f these concerts
will make for an interesting night. So if you like
this sort of thing, pick your poison, pay the price
and enjoy the freak show.

BOSTON (AP) -F orget the
w itches’ brooms, clown noses
and monster masks. This year’s
most popular Halloween costume
calls for a blue dress, a beret and
yes, a cigar.
“We
thought
‘T itanic’
costum es would be the big
rentals but it looks like Bill and
Monica are winning the race,”
said Stephen LaLiberte, rental
manager at Boston Costume.
As im peachm ent hearings
move forw ard in W ashington,
stores around the country are
fielding requests for costumes of
President
C linton,
M onica
Lewinsky and even Linda Tripp.
“W e’re getting lots of
requests,” said Claire Olerich,
owner of the Costume Gallery in
Derry, N.H., noting customers
are disappointed when they can’t
find
m asks
bearing
Ms.
Lewinsky’s likeness.

For the creative reveler,
dressing up as a figure from the
political sex scandal is easy,
especially with the details
provided in Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr’s report and from
Clinton’s grand jury testimony
broadcast nationally last month.
There are wigs to match some of
Lew insky’s
oft-changing
hairstyles. There are dark-hued
berets like the ones she wore in
those brief m eetings with
Clinton, captured on videotape, in
m eet-and-greet receiving lines.
And there are the cigars, inspired
by Starr’s allegation that in one
encounter, an unlit cigar was used
as a sexual prop.
“People even want the tie,”
said M arilynn Wick, owner of the
Fort-Lauderdale, Fla.-based chain
Costume World, referring to one
of the gifts the former White
House intern gave the president.

“Beloved” debuts in Philadelphia
Oprah Winfrey draws a crowd to the premier of her new movie

BELOVED COUPLE: Oprah Winfrey and Danny
Glover star as old friends in “Beloved,” a film
adapted from a Toni Morrison novel of the same
name. She has been working on the film for 10 years.

PH IL A D E L PH IA (AP) - Oprah Winfrey
drew a crowd to the premier of her movie,
“Beloved.”
Shot in Philadelphia and nearby locales in
Lancaster and Elkton, Md., “Beloved” drew
several hundred fans who paid $250 to watch the
film at Riverview Theaters and attend a reception
with the cast.
“We’re not in Hollywood, but this kind of
brings Hollywood to you,” said Amy Hendry, who
bought a ticket after seeing it advertised on
Oprah's television show.
Winfrey produced and stars in “Beloved,”
based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Toni
Morrison. It tells the story of an escaped slave
haunted by the ghost of a child she killed.
Winfrey plays Sethe, a poor woman
perm anently scarred by the experience of
enslavement.
Director Jonathan Demme said his positive
experience filming “Philadelphia” played a factor
in his decision to use the city as a stand-in for
Cincinnati, where portions of “Beloved” are set.
As W infrey arrived at the theater, some 500

fans shouted “Oprah! Oprah!,” including a few
that had acted as extras in “Beloved.”
Fifteen officers gathered outside to the theater
to make sure the star-struck crowd of about 500
stayed behind the yellow police barricade. A
parade of limousines brought guests to a red carpet
leading into the theater.
“This is my first premier. All the excitement;
it was worth the $500,” said Judy Smith, a
W ilm ington, Del. woman who brought her
husband to the event.
But some fans weren’t satisfied. Matthew
Williams, 12, waited for a half hour in the cold,
windy weather. He pressed his face against the
glass o f the theater trying to see more.
“She came through too fast. We didn’t even
get a chance to see her. All I saw was her head
going up the elevator,” Matthew said.
The proceeds from the event benefit the
African-American Museum in Philadelphia, the
Freedom Theatre, the Philadelphia Reads
program, and Women in Transition, a counseling
agency for battered and addicted women.

Alii Khat is not a licensed therapist

if you are very desperate, or make numerous
phone calls to psychic hot lines.

by J ill Stevens

Do you follow trends?
Why?

Dear Alii Khat,
My roommate wants to hang out with me all the time; he tries
to tuck me in at night and even once kissed me good night. It
seems as though he’s always in the bathroom when I’m getting
out of the shower and pays close attention when I’m changing.
Is he coming on to me or am I overreacting?

Dear Straight Guy,
In response to you question, I have tw o w ords o f advice fo r you: SW ITCH
ROOMMATES!!!

Dear Alii Khat,
One of my professors is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. I think he has noticed
me, too. Should I pursue the interest or stay out of trouble? -Attracted Student
“No, because I make my
own.”

Dear Attracted Student,
F irst o f all, m ake sure the interest is tw o-sided. I f you decide it is, then make
sure h e ’s not m arried. I f h e ’s not, go f o r it! You m ay have som ething

Dear Alii Khat,
I have recently been hired as the sandwich man at the local deli. Now my
friends are pressuring me into giving them free sandwiches. At first, it was fun
giving them out to my friends but now people I don’t like and people I don’t
even know are blackmailing me into giving them free sandwiches. I’m scared
they’ll tell my boss if I quit supplying the sandwiches. What should I do?
Scared Bread Boy

Dear Scare Bread Boy,
I ’m not sure w hat advice I can give you on this subject, but if you start spitting
on the fo o d you are giving them, I guarantee they w o n ’t be as eager to take the
