Provost of Academic Affairs announces
changes in schedules and class times
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
L ast Friday, after a m onth off, student
governm ent resum ed their bi-weekly meetings. But
before the senators could discuss MCT, phones and
leadership training in Potosi, M o., U niversity
Provost David W erner addressed the body.
H e told those in attendance there would be
changes in the academ ic schedule and in class times
beginning with the 1997-98 school year.
The changes to the schedule are:
• Moving the beginning of fall sem ester to
August 25.
• Moving spring break back a week to coincide
with other bi-state institutions.
• Abolishing the two-day break im mediately
following Columbus Day in October. Instead,
the two days will be added in N ovem ber to give
students a full week off at Thanksgiving.
W erner said the university was experiencing an
increase in in-coming freshm an which was putting a
strain on classroom space.
“The in-coming freshm an class is up 12 percent
from the previous year,” W erner said. “Right now
we have limited classrooms and we’re running out
of space. The university must use classroom space

ir

m ore efficiently.”
W erner asked for suggestions from stu d en t
governm ent and then explained a plan that the
university is considering.
“As I’m sure all of you are aware, Tuesday’s and
Thursday’s classes start at 8:30 (a.m.) and run to
9:45 (a.m.). This leaves classrooms sitting em pty for
45 m inutes until the next class. W hat we would like
to do is change the start of classes to 8 a.m. with
classes letting out at 9:15 (a.m.) with the next class
starting in 15 m inutes at 9:30 (a.m.). This would

allow for some students to take m ore classes on
Tuesday’s and T hursday’s,” W erner said.
W erner said he hoped student governm ent could
provide suggestions and recom m endations before
Septem ber 1. The deans of the university are also
working on a schedule change.
Finance B oard C hair A zhar U m er expressed
concern that if class times are changed, then M CT
must also change its schedule as well.
The Telecom m unications Task Force acting chair
was introduced and child care for newborns and
housing for freshm en were also brought up.
Black, who was ap p o in ted chair by N ance
pending approval from student senate, em phasized
the purpose of the taskforce.
“We will g ath er as m uch in form ation from
(University) Housing, O IT (Office of Inform ation
and Technology) and the adm inistration about
the recent situation with Tower Lake phones. We
will analyze all in form ation and m ake o ur
reco m m endations to stu d en t governm ent for
further action,” Black said.

students were concerned about the apparent lack of

Former FBI agent and 1971 SIUE grad
to be keynote speaker at commencement
helped catch alleged Unabomber’
‘

By Danette Watt
Assistant News Editor
A form er SIU E graduate and retired FBI agent will be the keynote
speaker at this sum m er’s com m encem ent cerem ony Aug 3. Clinton R. Van
Z andt graduated with a sociology degree in 1971 and was with the FBI for
25 years. H e was instrum ental in the investigation that led to the arrest of
the U nabom ber earlier this year.
The 51-year-old Granite City native said he always wanted to be an FBI
agent.
“It’s the only thing I ever w anted to do, ever since I was a young teenager
and everything I did was to prepare myself for that,” Van Z andt said in a
phone interview from his Fredericksburg, Va., office. Van Z andt w orked as a
clerk for the agency for a year and also served a year with A rm y Intelligence
in Viet Nam before finishing his degree at SIUE.
In D ecem ber of 1995, Van Z andt was approached by a private
investigator who asked him to com pare typed copies of two unsigned,
undated letters with the U nabom ber’s manifesto. H e later discovered that
the investigator’s client was David Kacynski, brother of Ted Kacynski, the
alleged Unabomber. The 53-year-old H arvard graduate dropped out of
society nearly 25 years ago to live a herm it’s life in rural M ontana and wrote
a 35,000 word M anifesto against technology.
Van Z andt had previously been an agent with the F B I’s renowned
Behavioral Science U nit which deals with psychological profiling. W hen
comparing the docum ents, Van Z andt said he looked for similarities in
sentence structure, word usage and com m on them es in how ideas were
expressed. H e said while a professor might take three pages to express an

idea because of the research
behind it, an ordinary person
might say the same in just a few
paragraphs.
Van Z andt said his training did
not allow him to harbor the notion
that the letters were from the
same person as the Unabomber.
The Unabomber
“In the FBI, I learned never to
jum p to conclusions and to not get
excited easily. Even though it looked like the same person (had w ritten the
docum ents), I had to keep in mind there was always the possibility som eone
else had written them ,” he said. Van Z an d t’s analysis confirmed authorities’
suspicions, leading to the arrest of T heodore Kacynski.
Van Z andt is now president of Van Z andt and Associates, providing
psychological profiles and threat assessments for private corporations. He
gave the example of a food com pany that might receive threats of
widespread product contam ination.
“The word usage in a docum ent can suggest to me when a person was
educated. C ertain words and ideas are consistent with certain generations. In
addition, words that have a nurturing, caring connotation to them might
suggest a wom an w rote them , whereas hard, harsh and sexist language might
indicate a male. With this inform ation, the com pany can narrow the suspects
down from say 1,000 to 15 by elim inating certain factors such as sex,
education, age and so on,” he said.
Van Z andt said he was looking forward to visiting with family m em bers,

State and Local -----------------------------------

Too little, too late Bill
Washington — President Bill
Clinton urged states Monday to
post “wanted” lists on the
Internet and in post offices to
track down “deadbeat” parents who refuse to pay child support.

Twenty states already post data on delinquent parents on the
Internet. Officials in the campaign of Republican presidential
candidate Bob Dole derided Clinton, saying he took too long to
address the parental delinquency issue. Two years ago, the thenDemocrat-controlled Senate unanimously voted to reprimand
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno for “failing to use
existing federal law to prosecute deadbeat parents,” according to
Dole spokeswoman Christina Martin.

Former Representative begins to serve sentence
Wisconsin — Former Rep. Dan Rostenkowski arrived at
a prison hospital Monday to begin serving his 17-month
sentence for mail fraud. He will remain at the Federal
Medical Center while his health is evaluated as he
recuperates from prostate cancer surgery.
Rostenkowski pleaded guilty in April to two counts of
mail fraud, admitting he used House money to pay
employees for personal or political work. The longtime
chairman of the House Ways and Means committee also
admitted sending a check to Lenox China to pay for gifts
for friends and political cronies. Jeanne Smith, a prison
spokeswoman, said the medical evaluation could take a
few weeks. Afterward, Rostenkowski will be moved,
probably to a low-security facility, to serve the rest of his
sentence. With good behavior, Rostenkowski could be
free in 15 months.

ChangesMore trouble with peace talks in Ireland
Ireland — Peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland ran into
more trouble Monday with the different parties squabbling over
the agenda and recriminations flying over recent street violence.
The British and Irish governments had been pushing hard for
progress at the talks, after the rioting that has struck the British ruled province in the last few weeks. But protestant ;and Catholic
leaders, emerging from talks at Stormont castle in Belfast, accused
each other of intransigence, and political sources said there had
been bitter recriminations over the latest troubles.

letter to the editor---------------------- — ----------------------— -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Defense of Marriage act not bigotry, it is preserving the sacredness of marriage
I would like to respond to the
editorial by M ichael W. Flota that was
in the July 10 edition of the Alestle,
attacking the Defense of M arriage
Act. It is not about bigotry but about
preserving the sacredness of m arriage
(whatever is left in spite of a high
divorce rate and adultery, etc.). To
approve (either legally or religiously)
same-sex m arriages is to say it is okay
and acceptable to practice
homosexuality. If you know the Bible,
you would clearly see that it is wrong
in G o d ’s eyes (as well as drunkenness,
prostitution and various other sins). It
is truly unchristian to suggest that any
of these are okay to do.
Jesus did hang out with sinners,
and he could identify with their
suffering because he had suffered as
well (consider the Pharisees), but you
suggest that he hung out with them to
show solidarity with them ? I’m not
sure I understand that. But just why
did Jesus hang out with the ‘scum of
the earth ’ (as the Pharisees judged
them )? Jesus tells us plainly w hat he
was up to in M atthew 9:12-13:
“those who are well have no need
of a physician, but those who are sick.
But go and learn what this means: ‘I
desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I
did not come to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.”
Jesus had not changed G od’s stand
on the wrongness of sin, he was just
revealing the mercy and grace of
God. D espite our sins, G od still loves
us and wants us to know him, but he
is holy and cannot have union with
that which is unholy (i.e.: sin). That is
why Jesus allowed himself to be
beaten, m ocked and put to death by
being nailed to a cross. Sin pays a
price:
“For the wages o f sin is death, but
the gift of God is eternal life through

Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans
6:23).”
Jesus received the price of sin in
his body for us so we don’t have to
suffer eternal death. Instead, he offers
us eternal life, if we are willing to
receive it:
“For whosoever calls upon the
Lord will be saved (Romans 10:13).”
Jesus did not want to condemn
anyone because he is not willing that
any should perish, but that all would
receive eternal life, but he did not
ever condone the practice of sin.
Instead, he taught the people to turn
back from sin towards God:
“From that time on Jesus began to
preach and to say, ‘Repent, for the
kingdom o f God is at hand.’
(Matthew 4:17).”
Jesus did condem n sin, he just
didn’t condem n people. The Pharisees
(religious leaders of Jesus’ time) did
judge and condem n everyone else as
‘unfit to serve G od.’ Now Jesus
accepted sinners when they came to
him (he wouldn’t turn anyone away),
but he roundly condem ned the
Pharisees because they felt as though
they were the only righteous people
around and condem ned everyone
else. Jesus rejected them as
PRO FA N E! But there were a few he
could accept when they believed on
him and followed his teaching.
The Pharisees were always trying
to trick Jesus to discredit him because
he always taught the truth (even
about sin: read M atthew 5:20-32!),
and one time they brought a woman
to him who was caught in adultery
and asked him what he thought
should be done with her since the
Law of Moses says she should be put
to death by stoning. His response to

them was not an answer to their
question, but a challenge to their
attitude:
“He who is without sin among you,
let him throw a stone at her first.
(John 8:7).”
W ho is foolish enough to think
they are without sin?
“If we say that we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not
in us (1 John 1:8).
No one threw a single stone, and
when everyone had left and only
Jesus and the woman rem ained, he
said to her:
“Woman, where are those accusers
of yours? Has no one condemned
you?” She said, “No one Lord.” And
Jesus said to her, “Neither do I
condemn you; go and sin no more.”
(John 8:10-11)
Jesus forgave her and accepted her
despite her sin. He looked upon her
as though she had not sinned. But he
clearly did not approve of sin, and
instructed her to continue living right.
G od’s mercy and forgiveness is
available for everyone, despite their
sin, but there is a requirem ent to
continue in his grace; repentance! I do
not consider myself as perfect or
righteous because of the good deeds I
have done, because I know that there
are too many evil things I have done,
but I am righteous by the blood of
Jesus. It is not my own righteousness
(it is as filthy rags), but the
righteousness of God. D espite my
sins, he has m ade me to know
righteousness by his love.
It would be truly unchristian to tell
the world that their sin is okay and
acceptable, and that God approves of
what they are doing. But it would be

letter to the editor-

In just one semester, SIUE has gone from the
best university in the area to the worst
Since I am graduating at the end of the
summer, I was going to write this letter
discussing all of the wonderful things I have
experienced at SIU E. However, after the
things that have happened here this sem ester,
there are very little things to discuss. In just
one sem ester, this school has changed from
one of the best institutions in the area to one
of the worst.
First, the university rem oved the old
bussing system and replaced it with M CT
buses, w ithout discussing this proposal with the
students until it was a done deal and not
listening to the students when the expressed
their desire to keep their old system. As a
form er student senator, I looked over both the
proposal from the old system and the M CT
proposal last year, and in my opinion, the
M CT proposal costed m ore and gave less
benefits than the old. Students from the upper
500 side of Tower Lake will not stand for
having to walk all the way to 516 to catch the
bus when w inter comes.
Then, just when you thought the worst was

over and nothing else bad could happen, the
university removed the ability to m ake the
most local long distance calls from Tower
Lake, without m entioning this new change to
the students until after the change was made.
As a resident of Tower Lake, I do not
appreciate having to use a phone card to call
home, especially when my hom e is in the
M etro-East area. This change is sure to hinder
the recruitm ent of students from the local area
for Tower Lake and the Residence Hall.
Unless students begin to fight back against
these new changes which negatively affect
them , the adm inistration will continue to do
things over the students’ heads. There used to
be a group of students which tried to prevent
the adm inistration from m aking these kinds of
changes, unfortunately, most of these student
have already graduated. W hat this school
needs is a new group of students to continue
their legacy.
Daniel Laleman
Senior, Political science

just as unchristian to tell a person that
he or she is not good enough for God.
Jesus won’t turn you away because of
your sin (though he disapproves of
the sin), but rath er invites all who will
come to come to him and receive his
forgiveness. H e will accept you, but
you cannot dictate the term s by which
he must accept you. H e has already
given the terms: repent of your sins
and believe on him. You cannot earn
your way into heaven, and you cannot
carry you sin into heaver
“H e who believes in him is not
condemned, but he who does not
believe is condemned already, because
he has not believed in the name o f the
only begotten Son o f God. And this is
the condemnation, that the light has
come into the world, and men loved
darkness rather than the light,
because their deeds were evil. (John
3:18-19)”
Legalizing same sex m arriages as
well as adoption for gay and lesbian
couples would be the same as saying
hom osexuality is okay. It would
underm ine the truth and make joke of
the sanctity of marriage. M arriage is
m eant to be a holy union of m an and
woman and God. G od should be most
im portant in o ur daily lives, and is the
most im portant part of a marriage.
Since G od cannot abide with sin, how
could he be part of same sex
m arriage? A nd if you think of
adultery (sexual im morality), you can
look in M atthew 5:31-32 and see that
it is the only case for which Jesus
condoned divorce! The day
governm ent legalizes same sex
m arriages is the day that m arriage
becomes devalued.

Hot releases offer co o l relief
By Brian Walsh
Lifestyle Editor
Summer tem peratures ranging in the 90s leaves one to search for entertainment
in cool climates. A nd the best solution is one that takes place in the comfort of an
air conditioned facility with the least am ount of physical activity as possible.
There is no better form of complete idleness than watching a movie. One
problem though—ticket prices. But there are ways to get around that, the best way
is to wait until the movie comes out on video tape.
New and not so new video releases, this summer, provide a plethora of good
quality films that will satisfy all finicky viewers. Although action buffs
will especially enjoy this seasons picks, those searching for
romance, suspense and com edy will not be
disappointed.
From a renegade A ir Force officer to a vigilante
mariachi musician, action flicks dom inate video
stores.
Broken Arrow features a crazed A ir Force
bom ber pilot, Vic Deakins (John Travolta), who
attempts to blackmail the U.S. by stealing nuclear
warheads that were aboard aircraft. His co-pilot,
Riley Hale (Christian Slater), and a U tah park
ranger, Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis), are the
only ones standing in his way.
Non-stop action ranging from fist fights to a frenzy
of explosions make up for the satisfactory acting and
character portrayals. John Travolta (A.K.A. Vinnie
Bobarino) is just a non-believable villain. Slater and
Mathis do play excellent heroes in the fight against
nuclear Armageddon.
Mel Gibson surely deserves the Oscar he received
for his action/adventure picture Braveheart.The story
of William Wallace, a noble Scotsman who dedicates
his life to trying to free his country from England’s
tyrannical rule, was written 200 years after his death
and is mostly based on legend, rather than history.
The portrayal of Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, is
certainly a one-sided attem pt to rally behind the
Scots. But who wants to learn about history when the
movie provides one of the best war scenes ever?
In the double-tape action/drama Heat A1 Pacino
and Robert D e Niro face off from opposite sides of the
law. Pacino, a tenacious cop closes in on a sophisticated head of
a group of thieves, De Niro, who pull off big money heists. This three
plus hour film is a classic good guy, bad guy story only with character
development of both, but not enough.
The lack of action in this drawn out story will disappoint the average action buff.

provide it.
12 Monkeys features a twenty-first

Get Shorty, starring (again) John Travolta, is terrific comedy about a suavely
confident m obster hired to pressure a second-rate Hollywood producer (Gene
Hackman) into paying off a large debt. Being an avid movie lover and finding that
the mob and the Hollywood film industry have a lot in common, he decides to try
his hand at movie-producing.
This movie is more of an adult comedy that will not provide continuous laughter.
But still, it is one of the top comedies of the year.
The Birdcage, starring Robin Williams, centers around the prima donna of a
Miami drag club set and his family in relation to the world.
D on’t let anyone tell you this movie is not funny, because it is hilarious, which
one would expect from a Robin Williams film. Williams also has help from a
wonderful cast—Gene Hackman and Nathan Lane.
Other great new, and not-so-new, comedy flicks include:
Vampire in Brooklyn—Eddie Murphy plays a vampire cruising the streets of
Brooklyn.
Happy Gilmore—A n ex-hockey fanatic finds out has a talent for golf enters a

ATLANTA (AP)—A day after
American swimmers won seven
medals in eight Olympic events,
the U.S. got a jolt in the pool
Monday when Janet Evans failed
to make the finals in the 400meter freestyle.
It was the first time Evans, a
four-time - gold medalist, has
failed to advance in the event at
the Olympics. She finished ninth
in a time of 4 minutes, 13.60
seconds, almost 10 full seconds
off her world record of 4:03.85.
Only the top eight advanced to the
final and Evans missed the cutoff
by 20-hundredths of a second
behind Eri Yamanoi of Japan, who
was eighth in 4:13.60.
“I’m upset. I ’m disappointed. But
nobody can take away what I’ve
done,” a tearful Evans said
afterward.
Kerstin Kielgass of Germany
had the fastest qualifying time of
4:08.99, barely edging Michelle
Smith of Ireland, who was secondfastest in 4:09.00. The U.S. had
protested Smith’s late entry,
claiming she had missed the July 5
deadline but the IOC allowed her
to swim.
Evans’ result followed a day in
which American athletes began
collecting their medals after tiny
nations like Belgium, Ireland and
New Zealand got the gold medal
jump on the United States.
After a 24-hour moratorium,
“The Star-Spangled Banner” was
finally tuned up Sunday, and
