SIUE Cougars in search of crucial sixth man
FROM SIUE NEWS SERVICE
That all-im portant sixth

home team to victory.
That’s
what
SIUE

basketball wants to see.
‘"We’re looking to tap the
student population on campus,”
said SIUE m en’s basketball
coach Jack Margenthaler.
SIUE students, who can

attend ail regular season athletic
events for free with a valid SIUE
ID, are a prime source of
enthusiasm from which coaches
and players draw strength.

2,500 kids to get books
BY DANA MILES
NEWS STRINGER
SIU has completed another
successful campaign for the Head
Start Program. More than 2,500
preschool children in southern
Illinois and the Metro-East area
will receive a special book to
read and treasure through the SIU
“Book
In
Every
Home
Campaign.”
The children receiving the
books are enrolled in SIU’s Head
Start and Child Developm ent
Programs. The Carbondale and
Edwardsville campuses operate
Head Start programs in Jackson,
St. Clair and Williamson counties

at a total of 17 locations.
The SIU Head Start
Program has been recognized
nationally for its success. The
program focuses on meeting the
social, intellectual, emotional and
physical needs of preschool
children in low-income families.
“I have found that children
who have books in the home do
better in school,” said Beverly
Sanders, campaign director and
wife of SIU President Ted
Sanders. “The East St. Louis
Center has one of the largest and
most successful Head Start

FROM SIUE NEWS
SERVICE
Christmas has come a few
weeks early for student loan
borrowers
w ith
the
announcement by the U.S.
Department of Education of a
new low er interest rate,
according to M arian G.
Smithson, director of Student
Financial Aid
at SIUE.
“Homeowners aren’t the only
ones taking advantage of
refinancing opportunities,” she
said. “Those with a student
loan should seriously consider
consolidating their loans and
refinancing at the new 7.46
percent interest rate.”
Smithson, a member of
the steering committee for the
National Direct Student Loan
Coalition, said that for most
individuals the new rates will
mean lower monthly payments

as well as a significant savings
over the life of their loan.
“On average with this
lower interest rate most
borrowers could save at least
$50 for every $1,000 of debt
they have through student
loans,” Sm ithson said. “A
typical student borrower from
SIUE who graduates with
$13,000 in debt could save
around $700 over a 10-year
repayment period.”
Consolidated loans at the
low interest rate are available
through the D epartm ent of
Education’s
D irect
Loan
Program. Private lenders who
participate in the governmentguaranteed
student
loan
program may also offer the
lower rate. Anyone who is not
in school or accepted for
enrollment in school and who
is making payments on his or

her loans is eligible for a
consolidated loan.
“The lower rate is also
available
to
in-school
borrowers, but only those with
direct loans only, and to
parents who have PLUS
loans,”
Smithson
said.
Applications must be received
by Jan. 31, 1999.
“Borrowers
who
are
interested in consolidating
their loans with the lower
interest rate formula should act
fast and contact private lenders
or apply through the direct
loan program,” Smithson said.
Applications and additional
information
about
direct
consolidation
loans
are
available by calling (800) 5577392 or from the Department
of Education’s web site:

Guest column -------------------------------------------------------------------

Just another student on MCT. Where is that bus going?
It would be restful to ride a bus to campus. It would
be cheap. And because I am stingy and indolent, it seemed
wise to explore the possibilities.
I’ve observed students stepping from the busses.
Their demeanor is placid. They seem happy and some are
still sleeping. But I wondered why some of the busses
were sparsely occupied. This question prompted my study
of the schedules.
Madison County Transit provides 19 scheduled
routes and the process appears simple. Further scrutiny
however, reveals that the white paths, dotted lines and
slashes do not stop where you are and do not take you
where you want to go.
Route No. 5 serves Pontoon Beach and 111. Highway

111. You can also board No. 5 Metro Link Station at 6:42
a.m, but you won’t return there until 6:00 p.m. Route No.
7 leaves Alton at 6:24 a.m. It takes you to the
Edwardsville Court House where you are handed a
transfer and tossed out. Another route tours Dupo, 111.,
before returning north. The M CT in East St. Louis
requires a transfer to Bi-State.
A number of printed locations have a NO in their
column. This means you cannot board or exit except on
Saturday at 6 p.m. at some but not all stops.
Possibly, at all the NOs, might the bus driver slow
down just enough for you to leap off and hope for minor
injuries?
Route No. 4 is the easiest. Beginning in Madison, it

Letters to the E ditorTerrible tenured teacher
The recent editorial “Here
today, gone tomorrow” struck a
cord with me. It mentioned how
good instructors tend to leave
while some of the rotten ones
stick around and get tenure. It
really makes me wonder if
anybody reads the teacher
evaluations we fill out.
The worst instructor I have
ever had was recently awarded
tenure. It’s not that I don’t like
the guy; he’s actually quite
entertaining. But all the antics in
the world cannot make up for the
fact that the instructor cannot
perform the basics of his job.
That is, he is not conveying
information to his students. The
worst part is that this semester he
is “teaching” several sections
of a basic-level class. If students
cannot grasp the basics that are
supposed to be presented in that
class because the instructor
spends class time fum bling
through examples and telling
lame stories, how can they be
expected to succeed in their
higher-level classes? I wonder if
he even knows what h e’s
supposed to be teaching.
Again I am forced to ask
if anyone reads the teacher
evaluations. I’ve slammed him
in the past and I know for a
fact many other students have
too. One student even submitted
a three-page essay (submitted
with his evaluation) explaining
how terrible the instructor was at
his job.
He still got tenure. I ’m
graduating soon and w on’t need
to worry about scheduling my
classes so I won’t have him as an
instructor. I’d rather stick a fork
in my eye than have him as an
instructor again.

Necessary Roughness
After reading your editorial
“Slumlords to the World,” I must
admit I was a bit confused.
Unfortunately I do not see a
connection between Southern
racism
and
international
terrorism. Racism is the product
of pure hate, while terrorism is a
means of getting the entire

world’s attention. I do not think
that Southern whites “terrorized”
African-Americans. The KKK
was not concerned with sending a
message to the world, only to
African-Americans. The Klan
was responsible for the horrible
deaths of many innocent AfricanAmericans, but they committed
the acts out of hatred, not to gain
notoriety.
Terrorists, on the other hand,
have a completely different
agenda. Acts of terror are
committed to get the entire
world’s attention. W hen an
airliner is blown out of the sky,
everyone notices — they are
supposed to. A terrorist’s goal is
to make all people think they are
in danger, regardless o f race,
religion or creed.
As far as Saddam Hussein is
concerned, why do you stand up
for him? He is not some poor,
innocent man that we are
bullying. In case you have
forgotten, he invaded Kuwait
eight years ago with no
provocation. He has a history of
using his weapons on his own
citizens. Let’s not forget his
“ethnic cleansing” program to get
rid of the Kurds. Do we really
want to let him develop more
weapons (biological, nuclear,
etc.)? I for one would not.
Think about it in terms of
sports. Let’s pretend the Rams
are a halfway decent threat to the
49ers and that Tony Banks is
their main offensive weapon.
Let’s also assume that Banks is
capable of changing the outcome
of the game. If you are on the
49ers, would you rather face the
Rams with Banks in the lineup or
out with an injury? Naturally, if
he could have that big of an
impact so as to change the
outcome of the game, you would
rather see him on the sidelines.
What this all means is that
if we prevent Saddam from
obtaining more weapons, we
prevent him from changing the
outcome of the game. The game
here is the power struggle in
the Middle East, which happens
to be a lot more important than
a Rams/49ers game. We are
simply trying to prevent Saddam
from hurting anyone else —
ourselves included. Is this so
selfish? I don’t think so.
Unfortunately any plans to

goes through Granite City to the campus. But you can’t
all move to Granite City.
Route No. 18 will take you from the campus to the
Fairmont Race Track, but it doesn’t pick up there. Maybe
the solution is to pack a lunch, board any bus, secure a
handful of transfers and simply ride. If the boarding time
were 4:30 a.m. it would be a splendid way to enjoy the
scenery, especially if you didn’t care where you went.
Route No. 13 stops at Anderson Hospital. Sources tell
me the architect of the bus schedules is confined in its
psychiatric ward. I think I’ll ride over and speak to him.

E.J. Gallo
SIUE student

None of our (and your) business
bomb Iraqi targets or assassinate
Saddam have met with strong
resistance. I’m not in favor of
war. I don’t believe it brings
about good things, but there are
times when we m ust make
decisions based on what is in our
best interest. I think we have
reached the point where a
decision needs to be made, and it
must be made with the future in
mind, not past mistakes. As the
saying goes, “What is popular
isn’t always right and what is
right isn’t always popular.”

Michael B. Aden
SIUE student
E d ito r’s note: Afghanistan,
Pakistan, India, North Korea,
Somalia, Rwanda, Congo and the
form er Yugoslavia as well as
many other countries also have
cruel dictators who harm their
people, two even involved ethnic
death camps to get rid o f an
ethnic group. Pakistan and India
have developed nuclear weapons
to destroy each other. I am not
defending Saddam. I ’m only
wondering if the reason why we
are so concerned about Saddam
is because o f biological weapons
and injustice, or if it is because
out o f all the other dictators who
hurt their people he is the only
one sitting on a sea o f oil.

This semester I had several concerned readers ask me
about the Alestle police incidents column. Most of these
students had been listed in the column at one time or another.
All were upset and wondered how we could print their names
and ages as well as where they lived without their consent.
Police incidents are a matter of public record and the
Danielle media serve the public by reporting this information.
Belton However, legalities aside, one student asked if such reporting
is ethical. After all, the police incidents column could be seen as no more
than a local gossip column to keep track of campus drunkards and drug
addicts.
A newspaper is supposed to inform the public. Is the Alestle doing
the SIUE community a service by printing the reports ?
I'm sure there are many people on campus who only read the police
incidents column, just as there are many who only read sports or only kx>k
at reviews. It is human nature to be curious, to want to see if your partykegging roommate’s name will be in the police column. Others may just
like to see if they know anyone who is in the report.
This is where many students have an issue. Is their dirty laundry
really news? If they smash up their GEO Tracker on Old Poag Road, does
the w'orld need to know? Does knowing who struck a deer on University
Drive warrant media coverage?
Some students would say no. As a matter of fact, those who talked to
me gave several reasons why the Alestle is just plain wrong to air their
business. They all felt their actions should not have been in the newspaper.
But does this mean we should chuck the section? There are some
things people need to know. For instance, last fall there were several car
thefts and break-ins on campus. Students deserved to know that burglary
was up during the holiday season. At another point last year, students'
lockers were being broken into in the Vadalabene Center. Students needed
to know this as well.
I'm sure those people who approached me will be happy to know
they have brought about a policy change at the Alestle. We will strike a
balance between the privacy seekers and the people who deserve to know.
All crimes and arrests will continue to be printed as they have in the past.
That means if you’re arrested for possession of narcotics, drunken
driving, beating up your girlfriend, spray-painting your calculus
professor’s office or failing to appear in court, you can still expect to see
your name in the paper. But if you just backed your van into the resident
assistant’s car, it won't get printed. Only accidents that involved
significant injury or damage will be reported.
After all, is a fender bender really news?

Telling stories about life as lived at SIUE
BY ROB MILAZZO
NEWS STRINGER
Many of SIUE’s 11,000 students are typical; that is
they graduate from high school and come to the
university to earn a four-year degree.
However, many are not traditional students. They are
older or come from different cultures or backgrounds.
Seven nontraditional students recently spoke about
their lives on the SIUE campus. The session in the
Cougar Den just before the Thanksgiving break was
sponsored by the Student Affairs Staff Enrichment
Committee.
KJ Jackson, a University Housing coordinator, said
she put the event together to give the students an
opportunity to talk about their individual struggles and
how they have persevered.
“Our goal is to constantly enrich the students’ lives,”
Jackson said. “We want their time here to be a profound
experience.”
First to speak was Shaheed Saleem, 20, a transfer
student from Rock Valley College in Rockford, 111.
Saleem said attending SIUE was an opportunity for him
to get away from home.
“I do get homesick, but I have a lot of family
members around in case I need help,” Saleem said. He is
also a member o f a pilot group for African-American
males.
“The group helps me deal with the stress of college,”
Saleem said. “I ’m looking to get more involved.”
Saleem handed off the microphone to the group’s
only international student, Oluwaseun Akisanmi of
Nigeria.
Akisanmi came to SIUE in the spring of 1997.

Akisanmi, like Saleem, said he often feels homesick, but
looks to his church and his father for support.
“My dad pays a lot of money for me to go to school
here. I want to do well,” Akisanmi said. “What bothers
me is that my dad had to pay $5,000 before they would
admit me. International studepts have to pay three times
the tuition that Americans do.”
Akisanmi went on to say that the university was
looking into the matter. “Generally, this school is a very
good school,” Akisanmi said.
Next to approach the podium was Kyle Thompson,
24, a graduate student in speech communication.
Thompson said he felt uncomfortable at SIUE at first,
then he joined the Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity.
“I’m a handicapped student,” Thompson said. “For
the most part I was terrified. A lot of my friends in the
fraternity helped me when I was in a wheelchair during
the spring semester. I feel a lot o f warmth and love from
the people on this campus,” Thompson said as he stood at
the podium.
Another student with positive words about the
university was Juan Carlos Rosa, 23, who introduced
himself as a “Hispanic gay m ale.”
“All my instructors have been very kind to me. I
enjoy being a part of this school,” Rosa said. When asked
about discrimination, Rosa talked about being denied the
opportunity to room with other students off campus, but
was quick to point out that he had not suffered
discrimination anywhere on campus. Rosa is working
with the Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Alliance and is a
member of the Puerto Rican Society of St. Louis.
The first female to speak was Keri Schanbacher, 25,
a full-time student and a single mom. Schanbacher is
interested in social work. “I want to work with children,”

BY RHODA T. HARPE
CHIEF COPY EDITOR
The Mercantile Distinguished
Lecture Series at SIUE got off to a
running start with its first speaker.
John Stanton, founder and
president of the Running Room
chain, spoke to SIUE business
students Nov. 17 as the first
lecturer in the M ercantile series
presented in partnership with the
School of Business.
The idea of a store that sells
running shoes and also provides
advice and information came to
Stanton when he took up running.
The Running Room chain is
based in Alberta, Canada, and
was founded in 1984. Stanton
said he w anted to purchase
quality running shoes from
someone with knowledge about
running, as w ell as shoes.
Finding inform ed salespeople
proved to be difficult, so Stanton
decided to open his own stores
with quality custom er service as
a basic tenet.
“There was a need and a
void,” Stanton said. “I took up
running late in life, I guess, for
me. I was about 35. I took up
running to lose weight. And when
I started, I realized there were
lots of people in retail, but
nobody doing w hat I needed
as a consum er. I need the
knowledge and the how-to aspect
of the sport.”
Stanton based his company
mission on a premise for success
that he calls the three “C ’s.” The
focus is on company, customer
and community. To demonstrate
his commitment to his customers,

she said.
When talking about day care for her son,
Schanbacher said that the campus day-care center is
great, but she would like to see it stay open later for
students who take night classes. Currently, campus day
care is open until 6 p.m.
Another full-time student and single mom is Ann
Mumphard. Mumphard transferred to SIUE from Jackson
State University in Jackson, Miss., a historically black
university.
“I was blown away by the efficiency here at SIU,”
Mumphard said. “The lines at book rental were short and
moved quickly.”
Mumphard said that registration was also very
efficient compared to Jackson State. “I’ve never had a
problem here, I feel like I belong,” M umphard said.
Both Mumphard and Schanbacher belong to the
Single Parent Support Group at SIUE. Both said the
group has been very beneficial.
The last student began by saying, “Hello. My name
is Steve McLean and I’m [pause] years old.” McLean,
who later said he is 55, didn’t give his age at first as a way
of emphasizing the fact that many nontraditional students

McLean worked as director o f marketing for a
company in Jacksonville, 111., but when the company
folded he was forced to find another career. After 15
laborious years as a carpenter and one long fall off of a
ladder, McLean said he opted to return to school. After
graduating with honors from SIUE, McLean is now
attending graduate school and studying anthropology.
“This has been an incredibly satisfying experience
for me,” McLean said. “All my life experiences have
applied to where I am now.”

Stanton said he spends time on
the sales floor dressed in running
clothes, T-shirt and shorts.
Som etim es, he said, a
customer will feel sorry for this
old guy selling shoes. Then he
tells the customer h e’s president
of the company. The usual
response is one of incredulity.
Em ployee team w ork

“Everyone is accountable to
everyone else,” Stanton said.
Employees know
what
is
expected of them. “I want your

want it better,” Stanton said he
tells his employees.
The Running Room chain
employs 250 and Stanton said he
is always keeping his eyes open

Stanton said.
He expects to begin with
stores in Portland, Ore., and

people involved.
Denise looked down at the
sleeping child in her arms and
smiled. It was a motherly smile,
one that conveyed not just a
loving warmth, but an air of
protection. From that simple
smile, you could see that Denise
would never let anyone harm her
daughter. Gently propping the
infant onto her shoulder, Denise
got up out of the hard Cougar
Village couch and walked over
to her 7-year-old son who was
sitting in front of the TV.
“Time for bed, Billy,”
whispered Denise as she turned
the TV off.
“But Mom, I’m not even
tired. Mike Williams’ parents let
him stay up ‘til ten, and ...”
Billy’s plea was cut short when
his mother put one finger to her
lips. He stomped his tired little
body down the hall in protest.
“Don’t forget to brush your
teeth, and quiet down or you’ll
wake up your sister.” Denise
took her daughter into her
bedroom and laid her in her crib.
She kissed her daughter’s head
and went to check on Billy. He
was already asleep under his
Power Ranger covers. Denise
wiped a spot of toothpaste off
his cheek and turned off the
light.
As soon as her son’s light
went off, a rumbling began in
the kitchen. At first she thought
there may be someone in her
apartment, but the rattling
sounded like dishes clanging
together. Denise hesitantly
walked down the short hall.
When Denise reached the
end of the hall, her body froze
with fear and disbelief.
Her cabinet doors were open
and a stack of her good glass
plates was floating in the air.
Hovering over the cheap
kitchen tiles, the plates clanged
against each other making sharp,

Photo by Mark Wood
high pitched noises that seemed
to stab at Denise’s eardrums.
This awful sound grew louder
and louder as the plates began to
tremble so violently that small
splinters of glass rained down on
the floor.
Without warning, the plates
stopped moving and hung in the
air like a panther ready to
pounce. That’s when Denise felt
it.
It seemed as if for a brief
moment the gates of hell were
thrown open, and something
hideously evil escaped. Denise
could somehow feel this
wretched, vile presence flee
from its hellish dungeon and
begin to ooze through the walls.
She was paralyzed with terror.
Every joint, every muscle in
her body locked into a tight,
rigid stance, like a matador
waiting for a charging bull. Her
quivering hands instinctively
balled into tight fists.
A dark mass that vaguely
resembled a person had seeped

through the wall above the
stove. Although the mass had no
eyes, no face and no definite
form, Denise could have sworn
it was staring at her, pulling her
eyes into its dark being. A brief
vision flashed before Denise’s
terrified eyes: her daughter,
Amanda, lying in a pool of her
own blood just before a
thousand hands ripped her into
pieces.
“No!” Denise yelled and
tore her eyes away. As she
started to run to her daughter’s
bedroom, one of the glass plates
shot out from the floating stack
and flew toward her. She threw
her arms in front of her face and
the plate crashed into them. The
plate shattered into hundreds of
sharp pieces slashing dozens of
small lacerations on her hands
and arms. The blow knocked
Denise to the floor and up
against the living room wall.
The infernal presence in her
kitchen angrily began to swirl
like a black tornado. All the

cabinet doors flew open, the
silverware drawers fell to the
floor spilling their contents, the
oven slid across the kitchen
slamming into the walls like a
pinball. Plates, knives, forks and
other projectiles sliced through
the air in all directions.
Straining to get to her feet,
she watched in horror as the
cyclone of evil demolished her
small college apartment.
Denise’s fear began to turn to
anger as she realized how
helpless she was to stop this
onslaught.
“Stop it! Stop it, right now!”
As if obeying her command,
the dishes and silverware
crashed to the floor, the stove
parked itself in the comer and
the mass stopped spinning. The
apartment was still except for a
single glass plate that continued
to hang in the air.
The vile presence in her
kitchen again seemed to be
looking at her. But this time she
thought she saw a face inside it.

(toe...

The face looked a lot like her. It
was a mother’s face, she
thought. However, something
disgustingly evil lurked behind
that face.
The mass slowly began to
swirl again and the single
floating glass plate started
vibrating. In an instant, the plate
propelled itself out of the
kitchen and down the hall.
“My baby!” Denise cried
and ran to her young daughter’s
room. She heard the glass shatter
and her daughter scream.
Rushing into the roorn,
Denise saw that the plate had
smashed against the wall just
above her sleeping child.
Carefully brushing the glass
fragments off her, Denise lifted
Amanda out of her crib. She
rested the infant’s head on her
shoulder and held her small
body tightly against her chest.
“Mommy’s got you now. No
one’s gonna hurt you,” she said
rocking the crying child back
and forth. Billy cautiously
opened his door and stuck his
groggy head out.
“Mommy, what happened?”
With Billy clutching the
back of her leg and her young
daughter still cradled in her
arms, Denise crept back down
the hall. She took slow, cautious
steps, although she knew it was
gone. She had felt its revolting
presence slither out of her
apartment.
A messy collage of broken
glass, utensils, pans and cabinet
drawers littered the floor. The
stove lay on its side in the living
room comer. On the back wall
where the mass had entered,
smoldering fumes streamed from
a charred two-foot-high circle.
“Mommy, what happened?”
said Billy who was still firmly
squeezing his mom’s leg.
“Mommy ... dropped some
dishes, Billy,” she said and
directed him back to his
bedroom to pack some clothes.
She couldn’t explain what had
just happened to herself, much
less to her son. Denise did know
one thing, she wanted her family
out of that apartment.

COPY EDITOR
The truth is ugly;
cartoons just don’t get the
respect they deserve,
especially when the cartoon
in question is “The Rugrats”.
Many Alestle readers
grew up in the '80s, the
Golden Age of Quality
Merchandise-Oriented
Cartoons. From the worldspanning epics of G.I. Joe
and Transformers to the
emminently likable Rainbow
Brite and Care Bears, schoolday afternoons were always
the best part of the day for
fledgling couch potatoes and
consumer zombies-intraining. In the transition
from the “Killing is Cool!”
Reagan Era to the “Trust No
One” ‘90s, there have been
some dead ends (the whole
live-action Japanese action
show premise), some bad
decisions (Ted Turner’s
crushingly politically correct
Captain Planet) and some
travesties (Frasier keeps
getting Emmies for rehashing
stale sitcom chestnuts while
the Simpsons get zip).
In “The Rugrats Movie,”
Nickelodeon proves that the
future of cartoons is in good
hands. Sensitive without
being cloying, topical without
alienating kids or parents and
most importantly funny
without being a joke in itself,
“Rugrats” is getting its day in
the sun with a return to a
format few cartoons have
sought out since the hey day
of “He-Man” and “My Little
Pony.”
The story opens with the
birth of Tommy’s new baby
brother Dil (short for Dylan),
and, as it has been in child-

C o m e d y sh o w leads to b a rro o m b ra w l

During the final moments of 2-Strong
Productions comedy/talent Showdown Nov.
18, a brawl erupted forcing everyone out of
Gallery Nightclub in Glen Carbon where the
event took place.
“It’s sad that we all can’t just get
together and have a good time without some
idiots messing it all up,” said Julious
Lawson, owner o f 2-Strong Productions, and
M aster of Ceremonies for the evening. The
contest included students from SIUE that
sang, danced and performed comedy. Many
SIUE students were in attendance.

The sad event that ended the evening is
hard to overlook. As an innocent by-stander,
one would have to say that the unfortunate
ending to an otherwise entertaining night
ruined a potentially great event for the black
community of SIUE. Yet the possibility for
an event such as this to work is not too far­
fetched. The presence of a bar in the club
was possibly a helping hand to the
catastrophe.
“There hasn’t been any problem before
when we had it (the showcase) here,” said
the owner of the Gallery Nightclub. Within
minutes of the outbreak, the Glen Carbon
police arrived and broke up the fight, and the
bar was cleared. No arrests were made.

oriented entertainment since
time immemorial, Tommy
finds himself feeling left out
and unloved. However, while
most shows would (and do)
wring this sort of story for sill
the “Awwwws” they can get,
“The Rugrats Movie” decides
to do something about it. In
no time, Tommy and Dil,
along with fellow ’rats
Angelica, Chucky, Phil and
Lil are on the adventure of a
lifetime. Lost in the
wilderness armed with only a
diaper bag and a pint-sized
Hummer with a voice chip,
the kids grapple not only
with the wilderness, but with
issues of friendship and
maturity. Think “City
Slickers” in diapers.
Some o f the most
touching moments come
from Tommy coming to grips
with being an older brother.
There’s a surprising amount
of pathos that comes from
this subplot, especially when
Tommy is forced to choose
between his friends and his
responsibility as dislikable
little Dil’s brother. In the end.

P o e t ’s
T h e
b y

the movie turns out a real
tear-jerking moment.
It also turns out a urinecloud rainbow, provided by
such musical luminaries as
Beck, Jakob Dylan and Lisa
Loeb. Don’t ask. That’s the
terrific thing about “The
Rugrats M ovie.”
It blends nutty, slapstick
comedy with a real familytogethemess atmosphere and
even an angle that the baby
boomers will appreciate.
Even when the movie starts
to feel a little overlong, even
when the story starts to feel
like an overdone Disney
wilderness adventure, even
when the novelty of the
circus monkeys wears off,
there’s usually something to
like, even if it’s just picking
out the celebrity guest voices
that pop in and out of the
movie (Tim Curry goes
against type and plays a
sleazy, dislikable character, if
you can believe that!).
A cartoon with terrific
writing and superb animation.
Optimus Prime would be
proud.

Endlessly drifting into her eyes.
Becoming erect like a sunrise.
Anticipating to probe between her thighs of ecstacy.
Her tender lips will undress me.
Kissing gently on her shoulder blade.
Hying to explore this funky escapade.
Rendering down towards the innocent black shade.
On my knees I impede becoming her slave.
After we have reached the zenith
of pleasurable satisfaction.
We lay embracing in deep breaths,
without moving a fraction.

Men’s team plagued
with turnovers in
73-63 loss to Lewis

By Todd Spann

BY BRETT LICATA

Usually I d o n ’t like any new
techno lo g ical ad v a n c e s
in
sports because it gets in the
way of the gam e b u t I like the
new first-d o w n line E S P N
created so view ers can tell how
far the team needs to go.
I'm ju st glad Fox d id n ’t
think o f this.
C an ’t you see th em having
the line explode o n to the scene
or just have John M ad d en draw
it on.

T onight,
th e
C ougar
basketball p rogram is read y to
pack the gym.
This whole w eek th e players
and coaches w ere pro m o tin g
spirit w eek, w hich will be
topped off w ith a G LV C gam e
against Indianapolis tonight.
L et’s face it, “ M ust See TV,
Thursday,” ju st isn’t w h at it
used to be and p arties d o n ’t
really get going until 10 p.m.
The m e n ’s an d w o m e n ’s

go out and m ake som e noise.
O r at least go for th e free
hot dogs before the game.

It will be u p to In d ia n a

Turnovers will kill a te a m ’s chances o f victory even w hen
it plays well in all o th e r aspects o f the game.
The S IU E m e n ’s basketball team found this o u t on
M onday against Lew is U niversity w hen it co m m itted 12
turnovers and suffered a 73-63 loss.
“We felt we w ere always in the gam e,” head coach Jack
M a rg e n th a le r said. “ B ut w hen you com m it th a t m any
turnovers and d o n ’t shoot the ball well, your chances of
winning a re n 't good.”
Lewis w ent up 37-30 at the half w hen it hit a d esperation
th ree-p o in ter as tim e ran out.
S IU E cam e back on the court playing flat for the first six
minutes, but w ere revitalized for the end of the gam e.
“The po o r play at the start of the second half is w hat took
us out of the gam e,” M argenthaler said. “N ot only w ere we
com m itting the turnovers, but they w ere capitalizing on them .”
The deficit was to o great as S IU E fell to 2-2 overall and 11 in G reat Lakes Valley C onference play.
The C ougars w ere led by Junior Travis W allbaum who
scored 21 points a n d grabbed 11 rebounds.
“Travis did an outstanding job,” M argenthaler said. “H e
exploited th eir c en ter.”
Ben W ierzba tossed in 13 points, w ith 10 of those com ing
from th e charity stripe. Jam es M arshall cam e off th e bench to
add nine points and dish o u t four assists.

The S IU E w o m en ’s basketball team let one slip right
through its hands against Lewis University.
A n undefeated record accom panied S IU E to R om eoville on
M onday, but an overtim e loss had the C ougars shaking their
heads on the way back hom e.
A lthough they had a one-point advantage at halftim e, the
Cougars had to rally a fte r going down by 12 with less th a n nine
m inutes to play. A trem en d o u s com eback had S IU E clinging to a
tw o-point lead with 16 seconds left in regulation time.
W hen Lewis a ttem p te d to score the equalizing bucket, S IU E

com m itted a shooting foul with 1.6 seconds left th at gave Lewis
the chance to tie the gam e 56-56 with a pair of free throws.
“I t’s one o f those (fouls) that you d o n ’t call at th e end of a
gam e like th a t,” h ead coach W endy H ed b erg said. “I w ould have
let it go. You d o n ’t d eterm in e a gam e like th a t.”
A fter sinking th e free throw s Lewis took the gam e, and the
m om entum , into overtim e.
S IU E co u ld n ’t m ake headw ay in the extra period. Lewis
continued to drive th e lane and score nine points in overtim e to
escape w ith a 65-60 victory.

voice continued. “I ’ve got tw o tickets to

Flags w ere w aving, fans w ere cheering and fingers

Several y ears ago five fratern ity guys from Sigm a

B efore a n y b o d y knew it, they w ere being called
The R ed Zone.
“We w an ted to go, ju st to go,” senior Chris Pegg
said, w ho was a p a rt of th e first five guys. “W e sa t in
the blue seats rig h t o n the floor and got this g reat idea
to annoy th e o th e r players. O n e player got m ad,
tu rn ed aro u n d a n d flipped us off. We liked it an d we

“T hey w ere ju s t having a lot o f fun,” m e n ’s
basketb all co ach Jack M arg en th aler said. “A n d it is
great to have th a t k in d o f fan su p p o rt.”
For the first y e a r th e school reserved a section of
the blue seats to th e g ro u p and T he R ed Z o n e starte d
to grow each gam e.
B ut the follow ing bask etb all season, T he R ed

“T he school said we co u ld n ’t sit th ere an y m ore
and p u t us in th e en d zone seats behind th e basket.
A nd th a t killed it because it isolated us from the

Pegg ad d ed th a t th e school got to o involved in a
unorganized g ro u p o f people.
“We w e re n ’t an organization. A nybody could

“T here w as ju s t a handful of us left from th e

The Falcons kicked off the start of
the half and Tony H o rn e took the
kick tw o-yards deep in his ow n end
zone an d h e a d e d up field. A fte r
starting up the m iddle, he quickly cut
to his right. H e had two players to
b e a t, o n e being a n tiq u e k ick er
M orton A nderson. H orne b eat them
to the sideline and tu rn ed the corner.
The crow d erupted. It was now a
one-m an 50-yard dash to the goal
line. H o rn e stepped in to the end
zone, high-fives w ere given and Bud
Light was spilled.
The first professional football play
the young m an saw live w as a 102yard touchdow n run to p u t the hom e
team ahead.
The crow d was still buzzing and
the young m an was still on his feet
w hen he h e a rd , “ Y o u ’ve got to
move.” H e tu rn e d to find an annoying

m iddle-age
w om an
leading a group o f six dow n the row
o f seats. “Y ou’re in o u r seats, y o u ’ve
got to m ove,” she sp u tte re d again.
“Well, let m e check m y tickets,”
the young m an said. H e checked the
seat, checked the ticket and checked
the w om an. “No, 7 and 8, this is us,”
the young m an explained.
“Well you w eren’t h e re earlier,”
the w om an brilliantly observed.
“Yes, but w e’re here now so we are
going to w atch the gam e,” th e young
m an re p lie d . T he w o m an to o k
an o th er drink, huffed and tu rn e d to
leave.
The y o u n g m an tu rn e d his
atten tio n back to the field to find the
R am s again on offense.
Tony B anks was still ineffective, as
was the offensive line, and the small
crow d began to boo mercilessly. The
young m an h a d n ’t h ea rd this m any
b oos since H allo w een . T h en the
crowd began to chant som ething. H e
thought the crow d was calling B anks
a crude nam e.
It was finally explained to him the
crowd was chanting “B o-no, B o-no.”
They w anted backup Q B Steve Bono.
Well, th ey got B ono on the next
R am s p o ssessio n an d his pass
atte m p ts w ere effective early. The
crow d c h e e re d m adly on each
com pletion and m ost incom pletions.
Well, this being the Ram s, the good
feelings d id n ’t last long.
W hen Jam al A nderson scored with
a few m inutes to go to p u t the gam e
o u t o f reach, th e crow d sto o d in
unison.
The young m an thought the fans
w ere
going
to
o ffe r
som e
encouragem ent for the hom e team .
H e was wrong. They w ere leaving.
For the last few m inutes o f the game,
the two tw enty-som ethings w ere two
o f only a few thousand people left in
the cavernous D om e. T hey stayed
until th e e n d o f th e gam e and
w atched the hom e te am leave the
field n o t to cheers, n o t even to boos,
but even w orse, to dead silence.
T h ere w ere now o n ly a few
h u ndred people left inside and the
tw o d e cid e d to m ak e th e ir way
tow ard the exits.
As they left, the com panion turned
to the young m an and said, “W atching
this team is a w aste o f tim e.”
The young m an sm iled and said,
“Yeah, but at least the tickets w ere
free.”
This is the story o f a young m an's
first experience at a R a m ’s gam e.
