Mazrui focuses on Africa’s passion

Neil BeitzallM /eif/e

Dr. Ali Mazrui, world renowned author and speaker, talks
with enthusiasm about the passion of Africa.

■ BY DOREEN VAN LEE
NEWS STRINGER
Valentine’s Day marked the
third annual African Night
Celebration at SIUE.
More than 100 students,
faculty and guests gathered in
the Meridian Ballroom in the

University
Center
for
an
evening of culture, entertainment
and reflection.
This year’s theme was “Power,
Passion
and
Perspective
in Africa.”
“There is a great deal of
passion in Africa but not enough
power,” Ali Mazrui, the keynote

speaker of the event, said.
Mazrui, a native of Kenya, is a
noted author, special adviser to the
World Bank in Washington, D.C., a
television presenter and an Albert
Schweitzer chair at State University
of New York, Binghamton. He
received degrees at Manchester
University in England
and
Columbia University in New York.
Mazrui
addressed
major
factors that he feels depletes
Africa’s power base. One of
the problems is the “brain
drain.” The “brain drain” develops
when young intellectuals and
academicians, leave their countries.
“Many of the young minds of
African are lured away by economic
and political factors
and by the
media from the United States,”
Mazrui said.
Dr. Dallas Browne, associate
professor of anthropology and
advisor of the African Student
Association, referred to Mazrui as
one of the most distinguished
individuals on the continent.
“Ali Mazrui is Africa’s most
distinguished son,” Browne said.
Herta-Malita Shikapwashya,

president of the African Student
Association, served as the mistress
of ceremonies.
“It took us three years to get Dr.
Mazrui to come to SIUE,”
Shikapwashya said.
Shikapwashya said they are
now preparing for next year’s
speaker. Getting a speaker and
planning entertainment is a
yearlong process.
“The process of getting a
reputable speaker and entertainment
is arduous because there are issues
of
funding
and some of the students are
preparing
for
graduation,”
Shikapwashya said.
The participants were treated to
a buffet of Senegalese yassa, beef
stew,
yam
stew,
nshima
and ugali.
Entertainment
included
African dances and a play entitled
“Coming To Africa.”
The play centered around an
African male who was sent to the
United States by his parents to
pursue an education. While in
college he met and married an
African American woman. Shortly

after their marriage, the couple
returned to Africa to inform his
parents of their wedding. His
parents were overwhelmed because
they were not informed of the
marriage beforehand. The conflict
caused by the difference in the
cultures of the young couple also
caused them anguish.
Closing remarks were given by
Brian Ngororo, founder of the
current African Night. He is an
engineering major who graduates
this spring.
“Many people of different
cultures give praise to the creator
and the land of which they come
from,” Ngororo said. "Americans
pay homage to their land by saying
God Bless America. I would like to
express my appreciation and
gratitude to Africa and say God
Bless Africa.”
African Night was sponsored
by the University Center Board,
Office of the Vice-Chancellor for
Student Affairs, Office of the
Provost & Vice Chancellor for
Academic
Affairs,
Graduate
School, African Student Association
and the department of anthropology.

Focused Interest Communities offer students
more interaction with others in their field
■ BY REN EE H O L L E R
NEWS STRINGER

Beginning fall sem ester
1998, students who wish to live
in Woodland Residence Hall have
the option of living in a Focused
Interest C om m unity (FIC). A
Focused Interest Community is a
group of students with the same
m ajor or sim ilar interests
living in the sam e area of
Woodland Hall.
According
to
M ichael
Schultz, director of University
Housing at SIUE, the FIC
program is designed so that
students
can
live
in
an
environm ent suited to their
academic interests.
“We are always looking for
activities that will connect inclass activities with out-of-class
activities,” Schultz said. “We
already have a floor at Woodland
for scholar students as well as a
floor for students that are

interested in nursing and it has
been successful so far.”
Schultz said that the FIC
program was developed so that
students will learn more about the
academic field they are going
into, not just in the classroom but
in the Residence Hall as well.
A student may chose an FIC
based on his or her major or other
area of interest. One does not
need to declare a major in order
to be in an FIC. FICs available
for fall 1998 include: Computers/
Technology,
Business,
Engineering, Nursing, Scholars,
Em erging Leaders,
Healthy
Lifestyles, Creative Arts, Foreign
Language and International
Experience. The Creative Arts
FIC is to be made up of students
who have an interest in art,
music, theatre and dance.
The FIC program was
developed by University Housing
to help meet the educational
needs of SIUE housing residents.

The program encourages students
to design their own programs and
experiences, such as workshops,
study
groups
and
faculty
interactions
outside
of
the classroom.
“I’m really excited about the
program ,”
Lisa
M cKirgan,
m arketing
coordinator
for
University Housing, said.
It gives students another
alternative
to
traditional
campus living.
“I think we are providing a
positive academic environment,”
McKirgan said.
“I feel the FIC embodies
what this school is and will be
about for the 21st Century,”
Timothy Mitchell, a freshman at
SIUE, said. He plans to live in the
Emerging Leaders wing at
Woodland Hall next fall.
“The FICs will help students
to
be
involved,
because
involvement is what SIUE is all
about,” Mitchell said. He also

feels that the FIC will help him
learn more about leadership
qualities and ideas.
“The great thing about the
FIC is that I will be able to
interact with other emerging
leaders on a daily basis,” Mitchell
said. “We may not all have the
same opinion, but we will all
have the same ideas and that is
important to me.”
Not all students like the idea
of FICs.
“[Most] students, especially
freshmen, do not know what they
want to go into,” Taryn Riley, a
ju n io r at SIUE, said. “These
students would not benefit from
an FIC.”
Although many educators
and students do feel the FIC
program will be beneficial to
students, some universities and
colleges do not offer programs
sim ilar to FICs due to the
competition and close interaction
students will have.

“ [The only fear] is that
academ ic com petition will be
negative,” Schultz said. “But
overall, I think the program will
be positive.”
University Housing stresses
that the FIC program is open to
all undergraduate students, not
just freshmen. Students who do
not wish to live in an FIC but who
want to live in Woodland Hall,
may do so as well. Current
University Housing residents
may choose to join an FIC during
the
U niversity
Housing
Reservation process.
For more information about
the FICs, please contact Kara
Shustrin, assistant director of
Residence Life for Residence
Halls, by calling 659-4628 or by
e-mail at ksnyder@siue.edu
“We are hoping everyone
who
can
will
try
a
Focused Interest Com m unity,”
McKirgan said.

DuPage growth means big contracts and big campaign donations
W HEATON, 111. (AP) —
DuPage C ou n ty ’s roads and
infrastructure
have
grown
dram atically in recent years,
spawning another, less visible
growth industry: no-bid contracts
awarded to companies that have
filled the campaign coffers of
County Board Chairman Gayle
Franzen.
W hile the county has become
one of the largest governments in
Illinois and a powerful political
base, it has lagged behind in
efforts to control the potential
influence of political insiders.
The
state
has
brand-new
restrictions to limit the use of no­
bid contracts. Lobbyists in
Springfield, Chicago and Cook
County now need to file public

notice of who they are and who
their clients are.
But in DuPage, lobbyists can
operate under the radar screen
because there is no registration
requirement. And Franzen’s term
as board chairman offers a primer
on how a politician can build a
big cam paign bank account
the old-fashioned way - by
collecting
donations
from
vendors seeking business with
government.
He has received more than
$150,000 in campaign donations
from
engineer consulting
companies and other firms that in
one two-month period early last
year were awarded more than $2
m illion in no-bid contracts.
M illions
more
have
been

collected from contracts awarded
earlier in Franzen’s tenure.
“Campaign contributions are
the m other’s milk o f politicians,”
Franzen explains. He contends
there is no problem with
contributors
getting
no-bid
contracts because there is simply
no connection between the two.
DuPage
C ounty
Auditor
W illiam Jacklin, who polices
county spending, disagrees,
saying such behavior “gives the
appearance — the key word is
appearance — o f preferential
treatment.”
Most contractors didn’t return
repeated telephone calls for
comment, but a few who did said
contributing is good business
because it promotes goodwill.

lawmaker A1 Ronan, declined to
comment.
Franzen, as chairman, doesn’t
vote when the board acts on
contracts. And he says the work
of deciding who should get a
contract is left up to staff
members, the heads of county
board com m ittees and county
administrator Don Zeilenga.
But staff members, the heads
of some county boards and
Zeilenga have also attended
Franzen fund-raisers.
Michael Formento, a Franzen
ally and head o f the board’s
Transportation
Committee,
which handles lucrative road
contracts, has attended Franzen
fund-raisers and is running to
succeed him. He also has
received donations from some of
the same companies that give to
Franzen. “It certainly wouldn’t
influence my decision, because
my decisions are based on the
recom m endations
that
staff
make,” Formento said.
Zeilenga has gone to Franzen
fund-raisers despite language in
the county code that says the
county administrator “shall not
be allow ed to participate in
political fund raising during
hours of employment or personal
non-employment hours.”
Zeilenga and Franzen said the
code was aimed at prohibiting the
adm inistrator
from
selling
tickets to fund-raisers, not
attending them.
Another candidate to succeed
Franzen, Robert Schillerstrom,
has called for restrictions on
contributions
from
no-bid
contractors and a requirement
that lobbyists register with the
county clerk.

“We support the candidate but
there’s absolutely no guarantee”
of getting work in return, said
Don Zimmer, a vice president at
Rust
Environm ent
and
Infrastructure,
a consulting
engineer company that pursues
public sector work around
the country.
Rust has contributed $13,000
to Franzen since 1995. It has
received more than $500,000 for
consulting w ork in 1997 and
has more than $700,000 in
outstanding contract amounts yet
to be paid.
“I think to take a passive role
is just putting your head in the
sand,” Zimmer said.
Franzen had been building his
campaign fund for a statewide
race, but dropped out after one
week last O ctober in the
Republican contest for secretary
of state, saying his heart wasn’t in
it. He says he will retire from
public life when his term is over
at the end of the year.
He acknowledged in a recent
interview that one concern about
a statewide race was the specter
of media questions about his
political style, including pinstripe
patronage — the practice of
giving government contracts to
campaign contributors.
“I was not going to get out
there and get pummeled again by
the press for not being politically
correct,” Franzen said.
Much of Franzen’s campaign
money has come from fund­
raising events, some of which
have been organized by a
lobbyist who also helps his
clients win no-bid contracts from
the county.

Didrickson taking on gambles in
campaign for U.S. Senate seat
JOLIET, 111. (AP) — Loleta
D idrickson sips coffee —
fortified with a shot of espresso
— from a Styrofoam cup adorned
with a winning hand of cards.
She’s about to do lunch with
the Joliet Chamber of Commerce
at H arrah’s riverboat casino
com plex. G am blers scram ble
past her to board a boat and try
their luck. But Didrickson is not
ready to roll the dice.
“I’m not much of a gam bler,”
she says. Instead, she stays
behind to work the room with
handshakes and hugs.
For Didrickson, 56, a bid for
the R epublican U.S. Senate
nomination is no game of chance.
She has carefully plotted each
move in the March 17 primary
race
against
conservative
millionaire Peter Fitzgerald, a
state senator from Inverness.
Her battle cry is simple: “I
can win.”
Didrickson offers that phrase
with a sly smile when a member
of the Illinois M anufacturers’
Association asks her to name
the
differences
in
their
cam paigns. It’s an im portant
point,
considering
recent
Illinois history.
Didrickson, finishing her first
term as state comptroller, is the
favorite o f the R epublican

establishment. She lists Gov. Jim
Edgar,
form er
presidential
candidate Bob Dole, Secretary of
State George Ryan and House
M inority Leader Lee Daniels
among her cheerleaders.
That lineup looks much like
the one Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra put
together
in
1996,
when
conservative millionaire A1 Salvi,
a two-term state representative,
stunned
the
political
establishment politicians with a
primary upset. Democrat Dick
Durbin then clobbered Salvi in
the general election by painting
him as a pro-gun extremist.
Didrickson wants to make
sure history doesn’t repeat itself.
She’s appealing to her party’s
right wing with a full cache of
fiscally
conservative
catch
phrases: “smarter, sm aller”
government, a “flatter, simpler”
tax system, an “overhaul” of the
Internal Revenue Service.
Fitzgerald
attacks
her
support of abortion rights and
gun control and compares her
to incumbent Democratic Sen.
Carol
M oseley-B raun.
Didrickson scoffs and responds
with television com m ercials
proclaim ing her “fundam ental
differences”
with
M oseley-Braun.
D idrickson says she’s not

worried that Fitzgerald will
probably outspend her. But
she issued an early February
fund-raising letter saying her
campaign is “fighting for our
financial life.”
Even so, only her fingers —
twisting and tapping behind her
back or in her lap as she delivers
speeches and answers questions
— hint at anything other than a
relaxed, confident persona.
Her path to politics has not
been traditional. But even while
growing up in Chicago, she
signaled she was ready for a
challenge - taking on boys in
softball games at a time when
girls were rarely encouraged to
participate in sports.
“My m other pushed more
dolls on me than I probably
wanted,” she laughs.
The product of a “rock-bed
Republican” family, Didrickson
says she got her own taste for
politics and econom ic theory
when she read her first Ayn Rand
novel at the University of Illinois.
She dropped out after her
junior year to get married, then
stayed home to raise her three
children. But she later finished a
com m unications
degree
at
G overnors’ State U niversity
before launching her legislative
career in the 1980s.

LIFESTYLE EDITOR

I seem to get creative during
the kookiest times. I went to two
concerts last week and while
being hyp-mo-tized by the
rhythmic bouncing o f the
mindless fan-kids, a jolt entered
my brain and a new idea was
spawned.
I’m always thinking of new
and exciting ways to make loads
of dough quickly so I can quit
school and not worry about
getting a real job or slaving away
at some daily rag.
Somehow, the wailing sounds
of Smashmouth and Ben Folds
Five caused me to come up with
another scheme. I will become a
concert promoter!
I already have a great idea for
a tour. 80s music seems to be hip
again, with retro club nights, 80s
lunches and movies like “The
Wedding Singer” celebrating the
greedy decade o f pop.
I will start a large stadium
tour featuring the reuniting and
comeback of not one, but two
80s supergroups.
That’s right kids, prepare for
the summer of The Go-Gos vs.
The Bangles! I think it’s about
damn time for a good oldfashioned battle of the bands.
It will be a wild free-for-all.
The show will feature two
smaller stages on one large
stage. Each group will perform a
song from their repertoire and
the audience will vote with
their cheers and jeers who wins
each round.
This is where it gets really
exciting. During the
intermission, there will be a huge
tag team wrestling match with
pudding or some other sloppy
material. The losers of the
concert might even have to
streak across the stage or
something. The details still need
to be worked out.
I’m working on having
Bananarama open the show.
Again, I will be accepting
donations for this mighty effort.

Third Eye Blind: from left, Arion Salazar, Kevin Cadogan, Stephan Jenkins, Brad Hargreaves

■ BY R ENEE H O LLER
l if e s t y l e s t r in g e r

For the masses, being a popular musician
seems like a great job. Bands get to travel, see
the world, perform for huge crowds and be
mobbed by teeny-boppers who think they are
gods. But for members of Third Eye Blind,
the occupation has a downside as well as an
amazing upside.
J
At a press conference
t #W 5
1
held Thursday, prior to
their performance at the
-Arion
American Theatre, Third Eye
Blind band m em bers Stephan
Jenkins and Arion Salazar gave all a glimpse
of their lives, their music, touring on the road,
their penises, their past and their future.
The one thing all the band members were
NOT shy about discussing was the fact that
their penises are not pierced.
“That’s disgusting,” said Jenkins, lead
vocalist for the band. “It sounds too painful.”
“I’m not too into the whole body piercing
thing,” said Salazar. “The only body part I
have pierced is my ear lobe. That whole
genital piercing thing is mutilation.”
According to Jenkins, who co-writes the
overwhelming majority of the band’s lyrics,
their music is about “flawed people who are
somehow redeemable.”
“Our music is fu*king awesome,” Jenkins
said. “People seem to love our music. I’m

grateful for the connection it has made with
people.”
Salazar, who plays bass, feels that,
although public opinion is important, his own
happiness with the music is more important
than what fans think.
“I play music for myself. We write what
we like, and if audiences like it, great; if they
don’t, well, so be it,” Salazar said. He gave

always there to make him happy.
“Playing for folks every night and meeting
new people and making people happy and
seeing that reaction on their faces as you play,
that’s great.”
“This past year has really changed my life
and it’s been the most flattering and enriching
experience of my life,” said Jenkins.

actress Charlize Theron, (“2
Days in the Valley,” “The

some advice to young musicians just starting
out. “Play music for yourself. D on’t try to
appease anybody or try too hard because it’s
going to show that you are a fake. Play music
that makes you happy.”
Salazar and Jenkins, both natives of
Oakland, Calif., are grateful to be playing
music for a living, but they do admit touring
can be a bit stressful at times.
“Sometimes I feel like a nut, sometimes I
don't,” said Salazar. “Just being away from
stability can be tough.
“You miss your family, you miss your
friends at home and being in a hotel or
bus can be a bit of a drag sometimes,”
Salazar said.
However, as much as Salazar dislikes the
details that go along with touring, his music is

would not comment, except
to say that, “Charlize is an
absolutely stunning actress, and I think she is
the most brilliant actress I’ve seen in a
long time.”
Salazar wouldn’t comment on his personal
life either, although he did mention that his
goal is to have a home recording studio along
with a dog, a cat, a wife and kids in ten years.
“I’m really a rom antic kinda guy,”
Salazar said.
When asked about whether he would trade
in his job for another, he said, “No, because
playing music and getting paid for it is what
I’ve always wanted to do, and I’m fu*king
grateful I can do it and there is nothing I
would do to change it. It’s totally worth it, the
pros outweigh the cons.”

If I was to say, “M ake me
laugh right now,” what would
you say?
I’d say I’m off the clock. I’ve
been on planes before and I’ve
assessed that the person next to
me is normal, so I ’ll tell them I’m

a comedian. And they’ll say, “No
you’re not, tell me a joke.” And I
think, you would never go up to a
guy on a plane and go, “What do
you do?” and if he said, “I’m a
lawyer,” you wouldn’t go, “No
you’re not, tell me a law.”
You're catholic. How far
will you go with that in
your material?
I’ll go as far as I want with
Catholicism. That’s because most
catholics have a good sense of
humor. So, they’re not as rigid
about making fun of it. You say
something about baptists in the
south and it could get really ugly.
They take it very seriously.
Stand-up was big in the
80s. Do you see a resurgence
coming?
It dropped off, but it’s slowly
but surely starting to inch its
way back.

FLU?
In the past 36 hours, have you begun
to experience flu-like symptoms
along with a fever of at least 100°F?

You m ay be qualified to participate in a research study
in your area for an oral investigational m edication to
treat influenza.
What kind o f material are
you doing for your new HBO
special?
A little bit of everything.
Some sports jokes, some about
jobs I used to have. T here’s no
real theme.
What kind of preparation
did you have to do?
I picked out a half-hour of all
the material I have on the planet,
which is about two hours worth.
Then I ran around town doing 30
minute [sets] in as many places as
I could.
Being on the road so much,
what kind of difficulties are
there as far as personal
relationships go?
Oh,
they
are
virtually
impossible, unless you marry an
airline pilot or somebody who is
gone as much as you.
How long are you willing to
sacrifice that for your career?
That’s a good question. I don’t

know. I guess I’ll know when
the time comes. When I ’m sick of
it, I guess. But to me, being home
two weeks a month is a ton.
I’m home a lot and I get bored
very quickly.
How often do you get
hecklers?
Not as often as the guys. First
of all, I’m only 5 feet 1 inch; and
since I’m a woman, guys feel a
little more hesitant.
There seem to be a lot of
vocal bachelorette parties at
the comedy clubs, though.
Oh, they’re the worst. And I’m
a woman and I hate to say it, but
drunk women are the worst,
especially bachelorette parties.
They probably haven’t seen each
other in awhile and they want to
talk. It always boggles my mind
why you would come someplace
you have to be quiet. It’s bizzare.
Drunk women can be very brutal.
What was your first time

onstage like?
I was nervous at first, but then
when I got up there it was no big
deal.
I
bartended
for
awhile, so I was used to talking
to strangers.
When you started, did you
have a specific set?
Yeah, I thought about it.
People who don’t think about it,
no matter how funny they are, are
going to find themselves lost.
When you get a chance to
see other comedians, who do
you see?
The people I like to see aren’t
famous yet. Well, some are, like
Kevin Meaney. A lot o f people
who are super goofy. I like
the super silly more than the
super poignant.
Do you think stand-up
comedy is a m an’s world?
I think more men are inclined
to do it. I don’t think most

Cougar ice hockey extends winning streak to 4 games
■ B Y B R E T T LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
It d o esn ’t get any better for a
second year program to have a
three-g am e w in n in g streak,
right? W rong.
The SIU E ice hockey team
notched their fourth victory in a
row
o v er
W ashington
U niversity 9-4 in front o f their
biggest crow d o f the season last
Saturday in East A lton.
The Cougars had a problem
staying out o f the penalty box
early on and W ashington took
advan tag e ju m p in g o u t to a
2-0 lead.
“We had to regroup. I think
that we w ere taking them too

lightly,” head coach Bill M isiak
said after his team w ent dow n
by two. “We started w orking
harder and picked up the pace.”
Before the end o f the first
period, SIU E had com e back to
take a 3-2 lead.
Brad Brussatti ju m p started
the C ougars w hen Jeff Rasch
and M ike G erling set him up to
put SIU E on the board.
D ave M isk elley tied the
gam e and Scott C loin added the
go-ahead goal before the first
interm ission w ith assists going
to Bill Cloin and M att Foristal.
In the second period, SIUE
exploded with five goals to pull
aw ay from its opposition.
G erling and B russatti set up

R asch early in the second
p erio d to give the C ougars
som e breathing room . Rasch
added another goal in the period
w hen he picked up a rebound in
front o f the net to give him 12
points in the last four games.
Brussatti, R asch’s linem ate, has
ten points in the four-gam e
w inning streak.
Scott Cloin tallied his second
goal o f the gam e on a
setup from R ob M aher and
D an Kennedy.
Foristal picked up his second
point o f the contest w hen he let
a blistering, ice-level shot go,
from the point, that beat the
W ashington goaltender.

Kenny Schrader was
1.005 seconds from first
place at Daytona 500
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) —
The official clock said Ken
Schrader came up 1.005 seconds
short
of
w inning
the
D aytona
500.
C ar
ow ner
Andy Petree m easured his
d riv e r’s perform ance by a
different standard.
“He and I are real close,”
Petree said as he gulped hard,
shook his head and rubbed his
eyes. “This is probably going to
make us closer.”
Schrader, bidding for his first
Winston Cup victory since June
1991, drove the entire 500-mile
distance Sunday, less than three
days after fracturing his sternum
in a crash.
Outfitted with a flak jacket, a
hard plastic shell on top of it and
an electric impulse kit to help
control the pain, Schrader drove
his Chevrolet M onte Carlo to a
fourth-place showing, matching
his best finish since 1996.
After the race, while Dale
E arnhardt was celebrating in
Victory Lane several hundred
yards away, Schrader pulled into
the garage area. His celebration
consisted of mustering enough
strength to crawl gingerly out of
the car.
“I really d id n ’t think he
should be driving the car at all,”
Petree said. “To make that

charge and a run like that, I
can’t put into w ords what it
means to m e.”
Schrader, w ho started 36th on
the 43-car grid, needed ju st
30 laps to pow er his way into
the top 15.
He spent the rest o f the day in
contention, w orking his way up
to second
and repeatedly
challenging for the lead at the
front of tw o- and three-w ide
trains of 3,400-pound machines.
After the day’s third and final
caution flag came out on lap
174 and set up a sprint to the
finish, Schrader m oved up from
eighth and nearly overtook
Jerem y M ayfield on the last
lap for third.
“I was w orried about him at
the end there because I knew
there was going to be a
shootout,” Petree said. “I was
praying for him not to get h urt.”
“There was no need for him
to worry,” Schrader said. “I’m
sore, but it ain’t that bad.”
Schrader chuckled w hen
asked how much discom fort he
experienced during the race.
“W hen them guys are laid up
all over you like that, you d o n ’t
think about a couple little
hurts,” he said. “I ’ll tell you, it
was there, but I had bigger
things on my m ind.”

Sprewell arbitration closed, waiting for final decision
NEW YORK (AP) — The
Latrell Sprewell arbitration case
came to an official close
yesterday, starting the clock
ticking on a 30-day window for
arbitrator John Feerick to issue
his decision.
Closing arguments will be
made before Feerick at a
Manhattan law office. Sprewell
will have already m issed 35
games - making his suspension
the longest in NBA history.
Sprewell is hoping that the
arbitrator reduces his one-year
suspension to time served,

clearing him to return to the NBA
before the end of this season.
The NBA has asked the
arbitrator
to
uphold
the
suspension, arguing that it was
not unduly harsh.
Sprewell also has filed a
grievance against the Golden
State Warriors for terminating the
remaining three years o f his fouryear, $32 million contract for the
two attacks - one of which is in
dispute - on coach P.J. Carlesimo
at practice Dec. 1.
If Feerick allows Sprewell to
return this season, he could join

January; four more were held
in New York in the first week
of February.
A total o f 21 w itnesses
testified,
ending
with
com m issioner
D avid
Stern
undergoing
four hours
of
questioning on Feb. 5.
Feerick
has
given
no
indication of how long he will
take to issue a ruling although it
could come at any time between
now and March 18. Before the
hearing began, the arbitrator
turned down a motion for an
expedited ruling.

the San Antonio Spurs in time to
be eligible for the playoff roster.
Spurs officials have privately
confirmed speculation they that
will offer Sprewell a contract for
the prorated portion of the
minimum salary of $272,500.
W ashington W izards owner
Abe Poll in has said his team
might be interested in Sprewell.
The Wizards, unlike the Spurs,
could offer Sprew ell their
available $1 m illion salary
