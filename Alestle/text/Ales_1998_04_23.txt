Cougar Village gets
telephone upgrade
■ BY S AR AH WU E L L N E R
FOR THE ALESTLE
SIUE is finally coming out of
the ice age.
Starting
M em orial
Day
weekend, SIUE will
start
upgrading the telephone system
in those apartm ents being
renovated in Cougar Village. The
system has not been upgraded
since 1987.
“The system we have now is
old,”
Angela
Imming,
telecommunication specialist for
the Office of Inform ation
Technology, said. “With the new
system we will be able to provide
stability in the phone system.”
According
to
Im m ing,
students at Cougar Village could
not always get a dial tone or
would not be able to make a long­
distance call because the circuits
were busy.
“Just the basic fundamentals
will be improved," Imming said.
In addition im provem ent
features will be added to each of
the
renovated
apartm ents,

Imming said. Students will be
able to buy their own telephone
number, which they can keep for
their four years here. This will
allow students to have voice mail
on their phones.
Another feature of the new
system is that students with
personal computers on campus
will no longer have to dial into
the system to get on the Internet
or e-mail.
“All students have to to is plug
the modem into the jack and it’s
at their fingertips,” Imming said.
However, those students who
are living in the economy
apartments will not have access
to any of these changes.
The downside to the new
system is that all students, even
those living in the economy
apartments, will now have to pay
for all calls, including local calls.
Fees will range from two to seven
cents. The charge for local calls
was paid for by the school. Calls
on-campus, including the Alton
and East St. Louis campuses will
still be free. A ccording to

Imming, the calls will be
monitored by an access code that
will be given to students when
checking in for housing. Students
will be billed directly and will be
able to pay on campus.
“You will be charged for all
calls made from the access code,”
Imming said.
Some students feel this is
not fair.
“I don’t think paying for local
calls is worth it,” Amy Barfield, a
freshman, said. “Some people are
already paying for voice mail.”
However, some students, such
as David Bozarth, think the cost
is worth it.
“I would love to have my own
line with voice mail,” Bozarth
said. “I would be sure that I was
getting all my phone messages.”
“I
like
the
phone
im provem ents,”
Anne
Sumowski, a sophomore, said. “I
would still like to call locally
for free.”

Single mother beats the odds by working
hard to accomplish her goals at SIUE
■ BY KOMIE
BUMPERS
FOR THE ALESTLE
In the wake of the current
portrayal by the media of the
hopeless cycle associated with
single African-American mothers
and their children, many people
question whether it is possible for
these individuals to emerge
successful with the odds stacked
so unfavorably against them.
Well, for one young lady it is
more than possible; it is reality,
“It is not the adversity that I
have overcome that has caused
me to develop into a determined,
dedicated and sincere person, but
the way in which I have utilized
adversity as an inspiration and
motivation to achieve my goals,”
senior political science major and
single-mother Tanya Brown said.

Tonya Brown
Brown is a young woman who
has experienced and triumphed
over a disproportionate share of
life’s hard knocks.
Tanya Brown arrived at
SIUE with baggage that was just
a bit heavier than the average
college student. Having endured
a series of foster homes, four
orphanages and an unsuccessful
adoption, Brown persevered in

school and won a four-year
scholarship that she lost due to a
pregnancy.
After so much misfortune,
most would regard Brown as a
high-risk candidate for the
unfavorable statistics associated
with single mothers and children
of the state. However, for Tanya
Brown, this is not the case. “I
do not believe that people are
solely “products” of their
environments. Instead, I believe
that people are “products” of
what they allow their minds to
focus on, and what they believe
in their hearts,” Brown said.
Brown goes on to say, “these
experiences, although difficult,
have inspired me to work
diligently at achieving my goals.”

“I am deeply com m itted to

states that multi-tasking, strong
organizational skills and yearround dedication are the tools
that keep her on track. “My

With

Pain and beauty in the Letters to the editor
Art and Design program Response to a response
I really don’t like to quit things. I'm a very diligent
person who sticks things out even when it’s apparent that
all fighting would be in vain or futile. I’m just that
hardheaded, but I did quit one thing here at SIUE.
I quit the Art and Design program. I was in it only
Danielle for my freshman year. When I crossed over to mass
Belton communications, many of my friends were shocked. I
didn’t make the change because one is harder/easier than
the other, or one pays more. Both have some degree of difficulty and
both pay little. My personal problem was the same as most of the art
and design students, and I believe many of them can relate to what I’m
about to write.
I quit the program for these two reasons:
#1: money
#2: loneliness
Like some fellow students, I had just left the lovely art student
world of high school where the supplies were free and the help was
bountiful. I actually liked my high school art teachers. We had a
rapport. In my high school art classes, we were one big family. It was
great. In high school I used to wish all I could take were ait classes.
I’d never met an art class I didn’t like. Then I came to SIUE.
Problem number one showed up on the first day of class. I needed
supplies and I needed them now. I had no car, so the only option I had
was to purchase my supplies from the school’s art supply store.
Needless to say, the prices were a “little” steep. Unless a student has
filthy rich parents that send them money all the time, I don’t know
how most of the other students are able to afford the supplies.
Everyone in my classes griped about prices occasionally. There was
always some special pencil or some $10 sheet of paper, or some $40
notebook that we had to have for the class. The problem was, I didn’t
have the $40 notebook or the $10 sheet of paper (and that is one sheet
of paper we’re talking about).
Compared to some other students, financially, I was actually
better off. I had an $80 a month allowance from my parents. Also, if
push came to shove, I could depend on my mother making the long
drive from St. Louis to take me to ArtMart to purchase some needed
supplies for class.
The loneliness came from my expecting my new college art
classes to be anywhere similar to my old high school ones. Most of the
people in my class were older than me. Cliques formed instantly in
most of my classes, and I wasn’t in any of them. When I started in art
and design there were only six (including myself) black students in the
program, and we all knew each other. There were very few females in
my classes. Everyone in my classes seemed worlds away from anyone
I’d ever met in life. Normally I like meeting different people, but most
of the people I met weren’t even friendly.
Having few people to confide in or relate to wore me down even
quicker. The hardest part was accepting that all I liked to do was draw
and I hated all my other art classes. I actually found myself battered
and bruised from dragging large planks of wood for projects from the
dormitory to the Art and Design Building, loathing every minute I had
to spend there.
Then the most stressful thing about it was that a student could
spend all this money, devote hours to a project and then get a C.
So, I have tremendous respect for anyone who stayed. I don’t
know how they do it. Being an artist is both a beautiful and a very
painful thing. I'm sorry that I didn't work it out, but I really respect all
those who do drag their large planks of wood to class everyday.
It has to be love.

Letters to the editor policy:
The editors, s ta ff and publishers of the Alestle
believe in the free exchange of ideas, concerns and
opinions and will publish as many letters to the editor as
possible. All letters should be typed and double-spaced
and be no longer than 500 words. Please include your
phone number, signature and social security number.
We reserve the right to edit letters for grammar and
content. However, great care will be taken to ensure that
the message of the letter is not lost or altered.
Letters to the editor will not be printed anonymously
except under extreme circumstances.
The Alestle is a member of the Illinois College Press
Association.
The name Alestle is an acronym derived from the
names of the three campus locations of SIUE: Alton,
East St. Louis and Edwardsville.

This letter is in response to
Mr. Thom as’ response to my
previous letter. Mr. Thomas can
rest assured that I take many moral
stands, such as supporting the
death penalty for murderers. Your
trying to compare abortion to an
affair is like comparing a whale to
a rabbit. An individual’s private
sex life is their business, not mine.
Will I necessarily agree with it?
No. When one’s activities should
become a public concern is when
it involves illegal activity, such as
sexual harassment.
To further this point, Paula
Jones’s sexual harassment lawsuit
was thrown out of court by a
Republican
female
judge.
Kathleen Willy’s allegations had
no merit to them either, especially
since congratulatory letters were
sent to the president after the
alleged incident. Bob Packwood,
on the other hand, was forced to
resign under the threat of
expulsion for admissions in his
diaries of sexually harassing at
least 30 women. Furthermore, I
won’t support candidates who
sexually harass others.
You should be concerned, Mr.
Thomas, when someday there is a
Republican president again. What
if a group of far left-wingers
decide to make up false stories of
sexual harassment against this
president? The right-wing should
stop playing games and get on
with the business of the nation.

SIUE student

Sex and the not so single
politician
As we turn down these last
calendar days of the ‘90s and
creep into a new millennium, I
definitely think that the late ‘80s
and ‘90s will be deemed the sex
scandal decade, solely based upon
the fact that just about every walk
of life has been touched with a
sexual harassment or sexual
misconduct case. There have been
many sexual harassment cases
filed within the military, clergy
and
government
offices.

Everyone from the President to the
Sergeant Major of the Army, Rear
Admiral of the Navy, rock stars,
actors, and comedians, teachers
and bus drivers are being accused
of
sexual
misconduct
or
participating
in extramarital
affairs, and pretty soon it will be
extremely difficult to distinguish
boardrooms from bedrooms.
Jerry Falwell and The Moral
Majority set it off for the Bible
Belt and Jimmy Swaggart brought
up the rear (so to speak). Anita Hill
and Clarence Thomas kicked it off
for the right wing. Superstar
Michael Jackson kicked it off for
the west coast when he was
accused of sexual misconduct with
a minor. Then there is the man of a
thousand
characters
Eddie
Murphy who was caught out at
night giving a transvestite a lift,
(dam those colloquialisms). Then
there is the knock down drag out
handsome George Michael, one
half of the ‘80s duo Wham, who
was caught in a park in Los
Angeles reportedly performing a
“lewd and lascivious” act in the
solo mode (if you know what I
mean). Funny-man Pee-Wee
Herman was also caught in the
very same compromising position
which single-handedly (for the
lack of a better word) put a
damper on his childlike image and
career. Then there was the actor
Hugh Grant/Divine Brown affair.
Grant received flack, but it
bolstered Brown’s career at home
and overseas.
Now, as is typical with high
profile sexual harassment cases in
Washington, D.C. and elsewhere,
women are coming out of the
woodwork even as you read this
insisting that they have done the
horizontal mambo or the backseat
vertical hold with political figures.
I am not saying I don’t believe any
of the women that are accusing the
men in question, but who would
want to go down in history as
being the president’s girl toy, or
anyone’s toy? Okay, maybe
Marilyn Monroe. I just think that
people are people, and no matter
what color the collar you wear,
you are prone to good and bad
deeds. Although the president and
other high ranking officials are
held to greater moral codes than

the rest of us, I feel that it is unfair,
because it seems that certain
officials only want to get up on a
high horse and spout out morality
judgments when they can’t find
anything else to unseat someone
else with. Although, I do not
subscribe to the conspiracy theory,
but I do feel that there is a definite
trend towards “fingering” or
“blowing
the
whistle”
or
entrapping people in high places.
It seems like the criteria for being
named in a sexual harassment case
is being of the male gender, having
a pulse, red blood flowing through
your veins and last (but not least)
having a good amount of political
clout. But I must admit that when
I first heard of the alleged
Monica Lewinsky/Clinton affair
(Zippergate), I became quite the
couch potato, tuning in to CNN
and Larry King Live every night.
But after awhile, I had to snap
myself into reality and say, “Hey,
this stuff happens everyday. There
is nothing new under the big
yellow ball.” I was in the military,
I should know. These affairs draw
a great number of people to the TV
and radio and help sell plenty of
newspapers to people that
probably would listen to less
sensational news second hand in a
bar or a cafeteria. I am not
condoning the behavior of the men
in the cases where they have been
accused of sexual misconduct. But
in all honesty, it takes two
consenting adults to tangle (you
can lead a horse to water...), and
whatever takes place between
them should remain private. It
cracks me up, and it never ceases
to amaze me that people get so
shocked and upset over other
people’s private business.
In closing, I would like to say
this to my fellow Americans: listen
up, people, these acts are not brain
surgery, and even if they were,
they are aimed at the wrong end! I
really feel that these bedroom
politics should remain as such, and
that we should do just as Michael
Jackson said in one of his biggest
hits of the ‘90s: “Keep it in the
closet.”

NATO expansion likely but questions remain
DALLAS (AP) — W hether it
is the risky blunder critics foresee
or the stride for stability the
White House promises, NATO
expansion to add three Eastern
European
nations
seems
effectively settled.
It would be a major change
with relatively minor debate.
Sen.
Daniel
Patrick
M oynihan,
a
New
York
Democrat, is trying to prevent
that, saying that to extend the
Western military alliance toward
the frontiers of Russia risks “the
catastrophe of nuclear war.”
Strong words, the strongest
yet in what has been desultory
debate on an issue that has drawn
scant public attention. Moynihan
and a bloc of Senate allies — no
more than 20 at this point — are
trying to block ratification of the
expansion President Bill Clinton
advocates.
To do it, they’d need 34 votes
in the Senate, when it acts,
probably late this month or next.
“As of now there is not much
doubt as to the outcom e,” the
New York senator said. “This
could change.”
Hence his grim words in an
address to the 150th anniversary

luncheon of The Associated Press
on Monday:
“If we do go ahead, we do
have to recognize that without
having intended it, we may have
raised the prospect of nuclear war
to the most intense point it has
reached since the beginning of
the Nuclear Age.”
Obviously, the Russians don’t
like the expansion, and the
adm inistration doesn’t pretend
otherwise. Secretary of State
M adeleine
A lbright
said
M oscow ’s concerns are being
handled through diplom atic
consultations.
But
M oynihan
said
a
weakened Russia could resort to
nuclear weapons for lack of
conventional military forces to
repeal
any
future
actions
Moscow deems a threat to the
existence
of
the
Russian
Federation.
Clinton
cham pions
the
admission of Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic as a step
that can help “bring Europe
together, not by force of arms but
by possibilities of peace.” The
administration pushed the idea to
adoption by the alliance.
“A larger NATO will make

A merica safer by expanding
the area of Europe where
wars simply do not happen,”
Albright said.
But Moscow doesn’t see it
that way, regarding the extension
of the Western alliance to the
borders of what was the Soviet
Union. NATO was created to
enforce the line against any
attempt of M oscow to move
west, beyond what were then its
satellites in Eastern Europe. In
the expanded alliance, extending
past the old Iron Curtain, the
com m itm ent rem ains that an
attack against any one NATO
state would be considered an
attack against them all.
The alliance created 49 years
ago put the front line of U.S.
defense into Europe as a bulwark
against the Soviet empire. Now
that front line would be extended
into a region that was part of that
Cold War communist bloc.
The Senate ratified the
Atlantic Treaty 82-13 that
summer, after three weeks
of debate.
Since then, NATO has been
expanded from 12 nations to 16.
“Each time, the alliance became
stronger,” Albright said. She said

this expansion “will have the
same invigorating effect.”
She said the quest for NATO
membership has led to the
settlement of border disputes and
other issues by the nations that
want in. She said the threats in
the region now “are instability,
ethnic cleansing, disputes over
borders, a sense of insecurity.”
But the expansion stirs a
sense of insecurity in Moscow,
and that’s where M oynihan
sees danger.
George F. Kennan, diplomat,
scholar, historian
and the
architect of the U.S. policy of
containment of the old Soviet
Union, says expansion will
inflame nationalist, m ilitaristic
and anti-W estern attitudes in
Russia, and could adversely
affect democracy there.
Albright argues the reverse,
saying the choice is whether
to validate American leadership
of a new NATO to deter new
threats, or to “leave Europe
divided as if the Iron Curtain
were still in place.”
Sen. John Warner, a Virginia
Republican, opposing expansion
but seeing the likelihood, wants
an amendment to prevent more

NATO additions for at least
three years; there are other
Eastern European states waiting
for an opening.
Clinton
opposes
that
restriction. “It would fracture
NATO’s open-door consensus,”
he said, although it hasn’t been
ajar for a while.
This expansion would be the
first addition to the NATO roster
since 1982.
And a dangerous one, in
Moynihan’s judgment. He said
if the Senate vote goes as
expected, the debate should at
least alert the nation and the
political establishm ent to the
risk involved.

have a football program , the
C ougar b a se b a ll squad is
capable of producing a final
score that seem s m ore fitting at
the Super Bowl.
The Cougars have moved into
the top ten am ongst NCAA
Division II schools in the nation.
In their current six-game winning
streak, SIUE has tallied at least
ten runs in each o f those games.
The winning streak matches their

season best; they also won six
straight back in early March.
On Monday, M cKendree
College came to town for a game
that was originally scheduled for
March 3, but was postponed. The
Cougars banged out sixteen hits
and defeated McKendree 12-7.
Each of the first six batters in
the SIUE lineup had at least two
hits and scored at least once.
Senior third basem an Jessie
Bugger had three hits, including a
triple. His younger brother, Mark,
had a pair of RBIs and a solid day
at second base with five assists.

“They talk a lot,” head coach
Gary Collins said of the two
brothers. “Jessie has had a big
influence on him (M ark). He
has gone through it for four
years. It’s really a plus. They
enjoy playing w ith each other.”
Usually strikeouts come along
with the great power that the
Cougars possess. But that has not
been the case with this team. The
d isc ip lin ed SIU E team went
dow n on s trik e s ju s t five
tim es co m b in ed on M onday
and T uesday.
“Surprisingly,
we
have

improved offensively,” Collins
said. “You usually start well,
and then the pitching takes
over. I think the w eather has
helped out, too. It’s hard to hit
in 35 degree w eather.”
On Tuesday, SIUE faced HarrisStowe College, another rescheduled
game from early March. The
Cougars fell behind early, but
caught up in the middle innings.
Harris-Stowe scored four times
in the eighth, and SIUE trailed by
a run going into the bottom half
of the inning. However, the
Cougars did not sweat it and were

pumped up for the win.
“If the coach has to say
something to get the team going,
you’re in trouble,” Collins said.
“They were not wanting to be
embarrassed at home.”
In the home half of the eighth,
the Cougars showed their
football-scoring
ability
and
kicked two field goals. The sixrun eighth put SIUE ahead by
five, winning 14-9.
“Sometimes you get behind,
and you just have to battle back,”
Collins said.
The Cougars are now 28-9.

Cougar Mark Briggs: consistent producer Softball to fight for regional
for team, ‘all-■round player and nice guy’ appearance over weekend
■ BY JASON
TRIPLETT
STAFF REPORTER
In
baseball,
consistent
productivity is the name of
the game.
This season, the Cougar
baseball statistic sheet is plumb
full of big numbers and .400
batting averages. Being able to
produce game after game is what
head coach G ary Collins is
looking for in a player.
M ark
Briggs,
a
senior
outfielder
originally
from
Roxana, 111., is putting up
statistics that you can bank on
every game. Last year he sat out
for most of the season.
“Fie has definitely rewarded
me for putting him in the lineup
this year,” Collins said. “H e’s had
a great career and his average this
year is steadily clim bing.”
If Briggs keeps his pace, by
the time he finishes his career as
a Cougar, he may be in the top
five in total career runs and stolen

bases and he might take the top
spots for career doubles, runs
batted in and at bats. Time and
consistency will tell the story at
the end of the year.

Senior Mark Briggs
Briggs has a .318 batting
average and has been at the plate
151 times in his 36 games this
year. Out of 48 hits this season
Briggs has scored 42 times,
tallied 28 RBIs and averaged a
.530 slugging percentage.
“H e’s an all-round player,”
Collins said. “He runs well, hits
with good pow er and plays
great in the outfield. I couldn’t

ask for anything more.”
Briggs lives with his wife,
Denise, and child in Bethalto, 111.,
and coach Collins describes him
as an “all-round nice guy.”
“H e’s just a good person and a
great citizen,” Collins said. “I can
count on M ark and I need people
like that.”
In
addition
to
Briggs
production,
seniors
Rob
LaMarsh, Jason Sievert and Mike
Robertson have combined for 111
of SIUE’s runs this year and all
three have an over .400 batting
average. R obertson leads the
team in hom ers and has helped
10 baseballs out o f the park this
year. Sievert leads in total hits
and LaM arsh has an im pressive
.690 slugging percentage.
The C ougars began this
w eek’s
schedule
yesterday
against
the
U niversity
of
Missouri-St. Louis and will get a
double dose of the University of
Southern Indiana on Saturday at
home, and on Sunday in
Evansville, Ind.

Sports Column:With Jordan gone, what will NBA do?
■ BY JASON TRIPLETT
STAFF REPORTER
What could NBA basketball
possibly be like without the
contributions of Michael Jordan?
Over the weekend, I was
watching the Chicago Bulls’ last
regular season game against their
nemesis, the New York Knicks.
Who would be the winner of
this year’s scoring title was the
question going into this game and
Jordan had answered everyone by
the end of the first half.
At the beginning of the game
Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal were
pretty close in contention. Jordan
lengthened the gap. He notched
20+ points in the first half of play
and by the end of the game Shaq
needed 59 points against the Utah
Jazz in order to take the title.

Shaq’s season high was 53, and
against the Jazz and Karl Malone
59 points wasn’t likely. Jordan’s
44 points in the game simply
backed up his past statement,
“When I have the ball you are
at mercy of whatever I want to do.”
And he did whatever he wanted.
If Jordan leaves, what do the
fans in the United Center have to
look forward to? Certainly not
consistent 44 point scoring nights,
but maybe the fumblings of Scottie
Pippen — trying to lead a team that
he doesn’t want to lead. With the
rest of the Bulls so used to
following, who is going to step up
and take the lead?
What the Bulls have to look
forward to are the stylings of the
Detroit Pistons’ Grant Hill, the
Minnesota Timberwolves’ Kevin
Garnett and let’s not forget Shaq.

Among the loads of talent in the
NBA, every team will be looking to
even the score for all the heartache
and the pressure defense that the
Bulls have inflicted during
Michael’s reign.
Besides a well needed rest
for Jordan’s 35 year-old body, more
positives
can
come
of
his retirement. The Bulls can
try to develop another star
player and use Pippen’s tutelage to
do it. All the Bulls’ other
talent can finally have the
opportunity to score more than
20 points with Jordan off
the floor.
In only 24 games this season did
Jordan not have the highest point
total for the Bulls and most of the
other times Pippen and Toni Kukoc
tallied more.

A couple o f wins against the
last place team in the conference
w on’t catapult the SIUE softball
team
into
the
regional
tournam ent, but they get the
Cougars back on the winning
track
w ith
an
im portant
weekend com ing up.
SIUE was relentless at the
plate tallying 21 hits and
w inning both gam es o f a
doubleheader
w ith Indiana
U niversity/Purdue U niversityFt. Wayne on Tuesday.
Niki M itts and Gwen Jackson
led the Cougars to an 8-3 victory
in the first game. Mitts hit her
sixth home run of the season and
Jackson went three for three
with an RBI, two runs scored
and added four stolen bases on
to her team -high total of 29.
Sarah Sollberger and Kim
Wagner each had a triple and
two RBIs w hile shortstop
Mandy U hrhan went two for
four with an RBI and a run
scored.
Junior pitcher Jessica Silbe
upped her record to 14-8 on
the year and recorded four
strikeouts to bring her total to 49
on the season.
Sollberger sent her team-high
11th home run over the fence in
a 6-2 win over IU/PU-Ft. Wayne
in the second gam e o f the

doubleheader.
Jackson slapped a triple in
the second inning that brought
home two runs and Uhrhan had
a pair of singles in the game.
D eanna Sm ith, of M orton,
pitched all seven innings to
record her 11th victory of the
season.
Although IU/PU-Ft. Wayne
w asn’t the toughest competition
that SIUE has faced this season,
head coach Sandy Montgomery
thinks that these were two key
wins for her team.
“It doesn’t m atter who we
play, w e ’re ju st trying to
accum ulate w ins,” Montgomery
said. “It’s hard to get up for a
game against a team that isn’t
very strong, but we played well,
and hit the ball extremely well.”
The Cougars are approaching
an im portant w eekend in
determ ining their post season
fate.
SIUE will travel to Joliet to
face N orthw ood U niversity,
Wayne State University, Grand
Valley State University, Ashland
U niversity and Ferris State
University. Depending on the
outcom e o f these games, the
Cougars could find themselves
continuing their season at
regionals.
“Hopefully we can continue
to hit the ball well up there
(Joliet) and accum ulate some
more w ins,” Montgomery said.

Cincinnati Bengals dump three veterans, sign nine undrafted rookies
CINCINNATI (AP) - One
day after they finished stocking
up on defensive players in the
N FL draft, the C in cin n ati
B engals
started
dum ping
backups o ff their roster.
The Bengals released safety
Bo O rlando and fu llb ack
Scottie G raham and w aived
cornerback Tito Paul. They also
signed nine undrafted rookies.
The Bengals stressed speed
in the draft and took defensive
players w ith five o f their first
six picks.
“W ith th is influ x o f new
talent, we ju st thought w e’d try

som ething
d iffe re n t,”
Jim
Lippincott, director of pro and
college personnel, said.
O rlando, 32, has spent
eight seasons in the league.
He played in every gam e
last season but started only
two, losing tim e at free
safety to second-year player
Greg Myers.
O rlando’s salary would have
accounted for $600,000 under
the salary cap, with the other
two players making less.
“I w asn’t really m aking a lot
o f money,” Orlando said. “I
don’t know the reason (for the

move) and I didn’t ask. You
don’t burn any bridges and you
move o n .”
O rlando signed w ith the
Bengals as a free agent before
the 1996 season and started all
16 gam es. His playing tim e
dim inished last season as
Myers emerged.
“ I ’m d isa p p o in te d ,
but
w hat are you going to d o ? ”
O rlando said. “I can still play
and still sta rt, but i t ’s a
b u sin e ss. I d e fin ite ly th in k
I ’m going to be so m ew h ere.”
G raham , 29, signed with the
Bengals before last season but

appeared in only five games
and had only one carry for a
yard loss. He d id n ’t fit the

Paul began last season with

w aivers by the B engals on
Sept. 9 and started five games,
but fared poorly. The Bengals
drafted co rn erb ack A rtrell
Hawkins out of the U niversity
of Cincinnati on Saturday.
The B engals also signed

Casey’s vision normal, rehab stint ahead

from page 10

CINCINNATI (AP) - Sean
Casey can get ready to play
baseball again.
Three doctors examined the
Cincinnati Reds first baseman
and found that the vision in his
right eye has returned to normal.
He is expected to begin a minor
league rehabilitation assignment
with the Indianapolis Indians in
seven to 10 days.
Casey, 23, was hit on the right
eye by a thrown ball during

Since Jordan’s rookie season, the
Bulls have built a dynasty around
him. They will need a few years
rebuilding to get that chemistry
once again. However, they
cannot expect Pippen or Kukoc
to step in because, let’s face it,
there’s only one M.J. and the
Bulls tried that once when Jordan
decided he wanted to be a
professional baseball player.
It’s fitting that Jordan retire.
He literally started a craze in the
world, yes the w orld, about
basketball and for that he cannot
be repaid. But all good things
come to an end. Jordan notched

his 5,000th career assist,
29,000th career point and hit a
few other milestones this year.
The next logical step for a
player who treats milestones like
stepping stones is simple. Bulls
head coach Phil Jackson might
not be at the end of the bench
next year. I am sure Jordan can
find the next step after retiring
from basketball. Jordan wants to
keep getting better, setting goals,
and attaining them.

Bird and Phoenix’s Danny Ainge.

required 20 stitches to close

Casey could not look up all the

pitcher Dave Burba on the eve of

Casey

Reds, went l-for-3 and was
injured before their third game.
