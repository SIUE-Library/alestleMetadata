Students get fired up for Spirit Week at SIUE
FROM SIUE NEWS SERVICE
Students will be seeing red,
and a lot of it, as Cougar Spirit
Week continues through Friday.
Wearing the school colors of
red and white will be all but
mandatory for the highlight of
the week,’’Pack the Gym Night”
on Thursday in the Vadalabene

Center. This night will not only
be a great time to see the
women’s and m en’s basketball
teams play, but it will be a great
chance for several people to start
the Christmas season early.
Halftime entertainment for
the games is likely to be as
spirited as the games themselves.
Sinking a 60-foot putt will win a

lucky contestant a 1999 Dodge
Intrepid. Scoring two of three
half-court shots will bring two
competitors a jackpot of $25,000
each. One lucky student could
win a spring tuition waiver.
Both the men’s and women’s
SIUE basketball teams will have
their home openers in their Great
Lakes Valley Conference that

evening against the University of
Indianapolis G reyhounds. The
women’s game begins at 5:30
p.m. and the men’s game starts at
7:30 p.m.
“This will be a week that will
really draw the university
community together,” Chancellor
David Werner said. “For five

days students - both commuter
and residential, full and parttime, graduate and undergraduate
- and faculty and staff will join
together to show their spirit and
their pride in SIUE. We invite the
community and alumni to come
help us pack the gym too.”

FOR THE ALESTLE

Jill StevenslAlestle

Students, falculity, and friends take part in the Turkey Feast pre-Thanksgiving
meal on Thursday November 19 in the Art Building.

Just inside the main entrance
of the Vadalabene Center,
students can find the Wellness
Center. The center offers students
a wide variety of services and for
the best price in town: nothing.
Wellness Coordinator Mary
Byron and Fitness Coordinator
Aimee Knitter encourage all
students to stop in for fitness and
nutrition evaluations.
“Students should realize that

what we offer here can be quite
expensive in the real w orld,”
Knitter said.
Byron, who was raised in
Edwardsville, returned home
after receiving her m aster’s
degree in physical health from
California State University-Long
Beach and serving seven years as
the health educator for the
campus.
“We
should
all
take
responsibility for our own
health,” Byron said.

SIUE police warn students of phone scam
Al.F.STLE STAFF REPORT
On Friday, Nov. 13, 1998
several phone calls were received
on campus from an individual
identifying himself as an AT&T
technician.
The individual advises the
person answering the telephone
that there is a problem with the
phone lines and that he is
checking the line. The caller then
asks the person to enter some
numbers and then transfer the

caller (technician) so that he can
check the line.
This is a phone scam. Please
do not transfer any calls off
campus, or give anyone your
authorization code. Anyone who
believes that they are receiving a
suspicious call should forward
that call to Telecommunications
at 650-3373 or to the SIUE
Police Department at 650-3324.
Anyone who receives a
suspicious call should note or log

the source of the call as displayed
on their Caller ID and contact the
University Police Department to
make a report.
If anyone believes that they
may have received one o f these
phone calls, please contact the
University Police Department at
650-3324.
Although the university has
systems in place to prevent this
and other scams, it is important
that all suspicious activity be
reported.

Boosters seek to revive Red Zone
FROM SIUE NEWS SERVICE
You might say SIU E’s
Vadalabene Center used to be in
the red. In a special place called
the Red Zone, that is.
Ruth Murray, president of
the Cougar Basketball Boosters
Association,and
adviser
in
Instructional Services recalls the
“very vocal” Red Zone of
Cougar basketball fans.
“It was several years ago, in
1994, with a group of kids who
came to home basketball games
regularly,”
M urray
said.
“Athletics set aside bleachers for
them so they had their own place.
It went over very well.”
The Red Zone went over so
well, it becam e a staple of
basketball games for two years.
“Those students were loud and
cheered, they w hooped and
hollered,” Murray said. “It was a
marvelous, fun experience. I
hope it can happen again.”
Well, it can Ijappen again.
Mark Thursday on your calendar
- with a red marker, naturally.
That’s the night o f the “Pack the
Gym” basketball extravaganza.
The w om en’s team takes the
court at 5:30 p.m., the men at
7:30.
“You shouldn’t ju st go to a
Cougar basketball gam e, you
should go to be part of it,”
according to D an C orbett, a
season-ticket holder, as well as
the budget director for the Office
of the Chancellor. “You should
leave the game hoarse.”
Since before 1966, when
Corbett received his first degree

from SIUE, he has been a Cougar
basketball fan. But C orbett’s
interest in basketball “was really
rekindled with the arrival of Jack
Margenthaler.”
Corbett noted that there are
“several levels” to a Cougar
basketball
game.
“First,
Margenthaler brings a different
level of coaching to the games.
He will be the Division II coach
who makes it to the cover of
GQ”
W atching the coach, . in
addition to “even the players who
don’t have the ball,” Corbett said,
is very important.
Listening, too, is pivotal.
“M argenthaler wears leather
shoes with leather soles that
make a popping sound all over
the gym when he taps them on
the floor. So, when he is excited,
whether for a positive or negative
reason,you hear a loud slapping
all over the gyjn.”
“Something else everybody
needs to know about the athletics
program,” Corbett said, “is that
the graduation rate o f athletes is
higher than the graduation rate of
the general population. At SIUE,
to be a competing athlete, you
have to be tough.”
Longtim e season ticket
holder Frank Akers also hopes
everyone em braces “Pack the
Gym.” “Students and others may
believe Division II basketball
isn’t exciting. If we can get them
to the game, we’ll show them
right away that that isn’t true,”
Akers, director of WSIE (88.7)
FM, said, “Also, fans who focus
on only the m en’s team will be
m issing some very exciting
games.”
And, as if seeing a good

game weren’t enough, prizes as
grand as a 1999 Dodge Intrepid
are being given away. Twentyfive thousand dollars may go
home with a lucky fan, too. And,
for the budget-minded student,
the possibility o f free spring
tuition hangs in the balance.
Akers, Murray, and Corbett
have been season ticket holders
for “at least” a combined 25-plus
years.
“It’s im portant,” Akers
commented, “to show pride in
your institution. It’s important,
also, to show support for those
who participate in co-curricular
activities-whether it be athletic,
cultural, or academic.”
Akers owes, in part, his
college degree to Cougar
basketball. An SIUE alumnus, he
supplemented his income as a
broadcaster by
announcing
Cougar basketball games, which,
he said, “helped put me through
college.” Basketball clearly is a
family affair for the Akers’. Joe
Akers, the eldest son, has
announced games for the last two
years.
But what about the Red
Zone? According to Akers, “I
still wear my Red Zone T-shirt
sometimes.” The idea behind the
Red Zone, Akers said, “was to
get students to wear the T-shirts,
sit in a specific section, and cheer
on the team.”
Bringing the surrounding
community, as w ell as the
campus community, into the mix
is just one of the m any ways “we
let them know what SIUE is like
and who we are,” M urray said.
“It would be a sensation for a
GLVC opener to pack the gym,”
Corbett said.

Here today, gone tomorrow Guest column
During my first semester as editor in chief I was
constantly stressed out. I was still learning that I could not
make everyone happy and I had to learn how to take
criticism whether it was warranted or not. During this time
when I needed guidance, I would visit the office of my
African-American literature teacher. Dr. Yvonne Fonteneau.
Danielle
When I first came to her class, I was apprehensive because I
Belton
had been told she was a bit crazy. I had heard nightmare
stories about her openly chastising students in class and randomly
flunking people.
But once in her class, I realized her “craziness” was only her
passion for her work, and all the nightmare stories were just because she
was professor who liked to push her students to do their best and
became frustrated when they failed. She reminded me of my mother
who always says what's on her mind whether it is of popular opinion or
not, and gives you the truth no matter how harsh or ugly. I enjoyed being
in her class because I felt that she had once been someone like me,
young, lost and confused. 1 desired the insight and perspective she had
gained and sought her advice in hope that I too would someday have the
same insight. She was one of the few people I knew who acknowledged
the fact that 1 was only a year out of high school and was bound to make
plenty of mistakes in my first year as editor. She felt that she needed to
guide me because she, like my mother, had already traveled this road.
Toward the end of the semester, Dr. Fonteneau became ill, and
when she didn't return this semester, I was woiried. It wasn’t until
yesterday that I learned she had fully recovered. Thank goodness. But 1
also learned her contract here had run out and was not renewed. Another
professor has taken over her African-American fiction classes and she
is the one who told me what had happened.
This is the second time in my three years at SIUE that a good
professor has been laid off or not offered another contract. I was once
told that a doctorate nearly guaranteed tenure for professors at this
institution. Perhaps it doesn’t work that way for all professors. I was
also told that this university wanted to hire more minority professors,
not remove them. Yet here is a black woman, whom I admire and who
is a wonderful teacher, but she lost her job.
When I was in elementary school, every time a good teacher
arrived whom students loved, but other teachers abhorred, they were
usually fired within two years. Afterward, no one would ever explain to
us why they were gone. We were left to make up our own fanciful
scenarios of why our beloved teachers had disappeared. I thought I
could avoid losses like this in college, and I thought this school’s
concern was for education. Yet, why is it when I find teachers I really
like, they fire them? Horrible professors stick around to haunt and ruin
another crop of potential scholars. Incompetent professors somehow
always seem to find a way into staying an extra year when they were
supposed to be fired, or magically making tenure so they can ruin
students into infinity.
But good teachers? Their paperwork is lost, their contracts are
overlooked or they just can’t seem to make tenure.
I am by no means saying that all professors who make tenure are
bad professors. I am a lover of teachers. My mother was a teacher and
I once wanted to be one. I realize how hard their job is and how people
treat them in a thankless way. I realize how little they are paid and how
much they do. And so far, I have had a good relationship with nearly all
of my professors at this institution. I just don't want to see any more of
my nontenured professors losing their jobs.
I am ending this semester missing Dr. Fonteneau. I wanted her to
see how I have grown. There are many questions I still want to ask her.
I really appreciated the advice she gave me during that first semester
and I enjoyed being in her class. 1 hope that someday she can come back
to this university and teach again. Although she may not want to.

Motivation in the eyes of a child
This past weekend I had an
experience that I would like to
share. Saturday morning, Nov. 7,
was
cold
and
miserable,
particularly at 6 a.m. I thought
very seriously about rolling over
and going back to sleep, but I had
the van and there were people
waiting for me to take them to
Alton. Damn Suzanne and her
volunteer projects anyway. So, I
shuffled off to the shower, made
the coffee and woke two o f my
sons who were to accompany me
on this project.
Let me interject a thought
here; I’m a year or two older than
most students on this campus and
I’ve been around — a lot, so I’m
not easily impressed, but I was
Saturday.
The project that I refer to is
an “Action Day,” sponsored by
the
Student
Leadership
Development Program through
the Kimmel Leadership Center,
and this Saturday our destination
was a Habitat For Humanity
project in Alton. We arrived
safely, said the customary prayer,
and went to work. My sons,
Steve and Mike, and I were in the
basement of a house that is being
rehabbed for a man named
Robert and his family. We were
building a bedroom and a closet,

a job that we have done many
times before in the course of my
business. I’ve been a carpenter
for the last 30 years but this room
was soon to take on a new
meaning for us.
I turned around and there
was a boy about 4 or 5 years old.
He just stood there with his
mouth open and his eyes must
have been as big as saucers. I
said, “Hi sport, what can I do for
you?” I took his hand and
showed him his new room and
his closet and I showed him the
doors that we were going to hang
and the hardware for them. This
was old hat to me, but it sure
wasn’t to him, he kept looking
around the room and then up at
me. The only thing that he said
during all of this was, “thank
you,” as he walked back up the
steps. About every third step,
he’d stop and look back with
those great big eyes and then he
went outside.
Mike said, “Wow” and went
back to work. Hoss (Steve), a
man of very few words, looked at
me, shook his head and picked up
his saw. Somehow I had gotten
sawdust in my eyes and ... well,
you know. At lunch, I heard this
little bitty kid telling his dad
about his new room and “those

University should have paid respect to our veterans

We should have honored our veterans on Veterans Day by closing
the university. After all, if it wasn’t for our veterans, we wouldn’t have
things like democracy and freedom which these brave men and
women fought and died for us to have.

great big guys” who were
building it just for him.
Over the course of the past
couple of months, Robert has
shaken my hand and thanked me
at least 50 times and until
Saturday, I really thought that
once would have sufficed — but
now I understood why, it’s
amazing the kind of motivation
you can derive from the look on a
little kid’s face.
After all of this, I have a
challenge for you as you read
this, volunteer for a project, any
project, there are lots of them
around. If you need some help
selecting one, stop by the
Kimmel and w e’ll fix you right
up. But before you do, paint a
picture in your mind of the look
on that little boy’s face, then go
and help someone. You’ll have a
great time, get to eat cold pizza
and make some new friends. You
don’t have to be a carpenter or
anything else, just a person with
a little time to give and the desire
to make someone else’s life, a
little better.

Just before Thanksgiving
break, “Enemy of the State,”
directed by Toni Scott, was
released in theaters nationwide.
This conspiracy thriller stars
Will Smith (“Independence Day”
and “Men In Black”), Gene
Hackman (Oscar winner for the
film “Unforgiven”), Jon Voight
(“Mission Impossible”) and
several other notable actors.
The plot centers around
Robert Clayton Dean, a
successful lawyer with a family,
played by Will Smith. Robert
Dean is passed sensitive
information by an old college
acquaintance played by Jason
Lee (“Chasing Amy”). The
material he is given is so
sensitive that powerful men, led by a National Security Agency official, played by Jon Voight, are willing
to kill for it.
Because he is unknowing of the information he possesses, Smith’s character stumbles around blindly
in a state of confusion and mounting anger. He makes inquiries and contacts his sources, not really
knowing who is after him. That is until he comes into contact with a man called Brill, a private detective
that he uses on some of the cases he undertakes as a lawyer.
Gene Hackman plays this former employee of the NSA who gets drawn into Dean’s chaotic fight to
get his life back. Because of his former job and expertise he becomes the only one who can help Dean.
The movie delivers evil bad guys and the gadgets that the government thugs use to track down
Robert Clayton Dean, which are scary in themselves. No stone remains unturned in their relentless search
for him and no personal item remains unbugged.
Watching Will Smith on the big screen is always a pleasure and in this movie he is able to act a little
more aggressive and dramatic. With this movie, director Toni Scott makes an excellent contribution to
the “government conspiracy" genre of films. It looks to be another box office success for Will Smith as
well, this time with no aliens.

Texas’ Williams stakes his claim to Heisman Trophy
BY JIM V E R T U N O
T H E A S S O C I ATF.D PRESS
A U STIN ,Texas — N ow th a t Ricky W illiams ow ns one
o f college football’s g re a te st individual records, is the
H eism an Trophy next?
A lready co n sid ered th e H eism an favorite, the
Texas tailback e n h an ced his position with 259 yards
rushing in Friday’s 26-24 win over Texas A & M in a
nationally televised gam e.
L onghorns coach M ack B row n said it w ould be
hard to deny the aw ard to th e leading rush er in
N C A A D ivision I-A history.
“H opefully voters saw things today,” Brow n said
after the game. “I ’ve n ev er seen a b e tte r perform ance
from Ricky th an I did today.”
W illiam s’ b rig h te st m o m e n t of th e gam e and
biggest boost for th e H eism an cam e in the first
quarter.
N eeding 11 yards to b re a k Tony D o rse tt’s career
rushing reco rd , W illiam s rip p e d off a 60-yard
touchdow n ru n in w hich he bro k e a tackle n ear the
line of scrim m age an d carried an A & M defensive
back into the end zone.
"T h a t’s a run I'll re m e m b e r for the rest o f my life,”
Brown said.
Williams finished the gam e with 6,279 career yards,
surpassing D o rse tt’s m ark of 6,082 set at Pittsburgh
from 1973-76.
Several previous H eism an w inners w ere at the

gam e Friday to congratulate Williams. D o rsett, Texas’
E arl C am pbell and Texas A & M ’s John D avid Crow
all m ade th eir way to the sideline for W illiam s’
m em orable run.
“I t’s special to me th at those guys w ere on the
sideline to w atch me play,” W illiam s said.
W illiams has bro k en national and school records
held by D orsett, Cam pbell and O hio S tate’s A rchie
G riffin, the only tw o-tim e H eism an winner.
W illiams would be Texas’ first H eism an w inner
since C am pbell in 1977.
O ne player w ho could stan d in W illiam s’ way is
K ansas State q u arterback M ichael Bishop, w ho has
led the W ildcats to a No. 2 ran k in g and a b erth in the
Big 12 cham pionship gam e D ec. 5. Two w eeks ago,
half o f the Big 12 coaches said B ishop should get
serious consideration for league offensive MVP. The
idea d id n 't go over well with Brow n.
“A nybody w ho saw Ricky to d ay w ould know h e ’s
the m ost valuable player in the Big 12 C onference,”
B row n said.
B ishop has b een h u rt by a lack o f n atio n a l
ex p o su re a fte r K ansas S ta te coach Bill S nyder
im posed a m edia ban on him for several weeks.
Williams, m eanw hile, has m et w ith the m edia every
w eek and his smile and dreadlocks have consistently
ap p eared in new spapers, m agazines and on television.
W illiams said he w on’t think about the H eism an
until after final exam s this w eek. A n d he said he
h a sn 't given m uch thought to his place in college

football history.
“ H opefully I’ll be considered one o f the best,”
he said.
Surely he will be. H e owns 16 N C A A records.
A long w ith the rushing reco rd , W illiam s’ m arks
include touchdow ns (75), points (452) and all-purpose
yards (7,206).
W illiam s su rp risin g ly r e tu rn e d fo r his se n io r
season a fte r leading the nation in rushing in 1997.
P a rt o f his decision to stay was to help the
L o n g h o rn s’ transition to B row n, w ho cam e to Texas
from N o rth C arolina. B ut he also knew th e H eism an
Trophy was a possibility and D o rse tt’s m ilestone was
in reach.
A n d so far he has answ ered all the questions th at
cam e up w hen the season started.
C ould the H eism an w inner com e fro m a losing
team ? Texas w as 4-7 last year, but reb o u n d ed behind
W illiams to finish 8-3 this year. T he L onghorns cam e
up o n e gam e sh o rt o f playing fo r th e Big 12
cham pionship.
C o u ld W illiam s b re a k D o rs e tt’s re c o rd w hen
defenses w ould be stacked up to stop him ? W illiam s’
2,124 yards this season are the fifth-highest single­
season m ark. H e also set th e record for average yards
p er carry, 6.22.
His only su b p ar gam e this season cam e against
K ansas State, which held him to 43 yards on 25
carries.
