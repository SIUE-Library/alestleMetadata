Lot C gets
face lift for
second time
■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
As trucks and construction
workers ripped
through
the
pavement of Parking Lot C, most
saw it as business as usual for the
wide scale parking lot construction
plan throughout the university. Yet,
some wondered if the lot wasn’t just
repaved last year.
According to Todd Schroeder,
project
coordinator
for
administrative services, last year
part of Lot C was under
construction for electrical reasons.
This time the entire lot needs a
B o b F e h r in g e r /Alestle
complete overhaul.
Lot C, the metered parking lot, gets another face lift and won’t be finished for at least six weeks. Due to recent heavy

see PARKING, page 2 rains and storms, work on the lot may be slowed, but the lot is still projected to be finished on time.

Historic Preservation Commission makes $500,000 bid for
Sigma Phi Epsilon house, but frat not certain about the move
■ BY DANIELLE
BELTON
e d i t o r in c h i e f

After serving as the home
of SIUE’s chapter of the Sigma
Phi Epsilon fraternity for 16
years, the Historic Preservation
Com m ission
has
shown
interest in purchasing the
Stephenson house.
The Sigma Phi Epsilon
Fraternity acquired the house in
1982. According to Sigma Phi
Epsilon
President,
Jason
Holtgrewe, it took over a year to
get the house zoned as a
fraternity house.
Holtgrewe express concern
about the com mission’s desire to
purchase the house, because if
the house is sold, they will have
no place to go. Currently, the
fraternity uses the house to hold

their meetings and fraternity
functions.
So far the commission has
not contacted Sigma Phi Epsilon,
but Holtgrewe said that they will
probably get in cjontact with their
broad of alumni by the end of
June or July. It will be the
alumni’s decision whether or not
the house will be sold.
“The house ¡is really kinda a
big part of the chapter,” said
Holtgrewe,
an
electrical
engineering major at SIUE.
Holtgrewe called the home a
“neutral meeting place” for the
fraternity and believes the whole
situation over the sale will pose
“interesting.”
Holtgrewe said that the ideal
solution for the fraternity, if they
did decide to sell the house,
would to be able to build a house
on campus. Currently, only Alpha

Phi Alpha Fraternity has a house
built off Cougar Lake on campus.
Holtgrewe hopes they could
use the money from the possible
sale to build an on-canipus house,
but the fraternity isn’t sure how
the university will feel about that.
Holtgrewe fears that the
fraternity will not be able to
acquire another house offcampus since the city of
Edwardsville no longer zones
fraternity and sorority houses.
The Stephenson hom e’s
fireplace and intereior woodwork
are considered some of the best
examples of craftsmanship and
carpentry for its time period. It’s
one of the oldest brick structures
in Madison County.
The commission wishes to
purchase it and renovate it into a
muesum or for some other use.

Community garden brings food and life to 400 side of Cougar Village
■ BY DANIELLE BELTON
EDITOR IN CHIEF
SIUE housing residents thumbs are turning a little bit
greener with the new addition of a community garden for
Cougar Village family housing residents.
On the 400 side o f Cougar Villiage, eleven families
have come together to grow fruits and vegetables on their

individual plots in the community garden. The garden was
founded by the U niversity Housing Facilities
Managament, along with K.J. Jackson, Family Housing
coordinator.
According to Jackson, she got the idea after learning
that many other univerisities had similar programs. There
are 16 individual gardening plots; each family that applied
recieved a plot to cultivate.

Jackson said that so far there has been a “fantastic
community effort.” The 11 families involved in the
project have planted corn, pumkins and many other
vegetables. They hope to harvest the pumpkin patch
in October.
Jackson believes that the garden will help provide
food to families that may have had to do without or were
otherwise financially unstable.

Lot C, the metered parking lot surrounded by the University
Center and the back of the Rendleman Building, is being completely
resurfaced due to serious drainage problems.
“The curvings have deteriorated so much that they need to be
completely dug up and started over from scratch,” Schroeder said.
The lot and the road leading to it are being resurfaced by BymeJones Construction for Hurst-Rosche, the contractors.
According to Schroeder it will take up to six weeks to compelete
the lot. The recent heavy rains may impact the finish date, but
Schroeder believes that the company will be able to make up the lost
time and still be done in six weeks.

The slaughter of the
anonymous in Jasper
All my life I’ve always known that I was black. It
was kind of like knowing that you’re a girl rather than a
boy. I just kind of knew that I was different and my
family was different in some kind of way, and that was
just it. There was nothing I could do about it and there
Danielle was no way around it. I was bom this way.
Therefore, as I grew older and began to understand
Belton
the world around me, what I could never understand
was how people could form an opinion about me without even
knowing me. The thing I didn’t understand was racism.
I grew up with the desire to be well-liked and to make people
happy, therefore to have someone totally dislike me without even
knowing me boggled my mind. And it still does to this day, because
it is the most irrational thing and impractical thing. It benefits no one
and only hurts people.
My mother enlightened me on the much publicized case in
Jasper, Tx., where a black man walking home from a wedding
shower was drug to his death, chained to a pick-up truck by three
white men.
They’d never met James Byrd Jr. They didn't know if he had a
family that loved him. They didn’t know whether he was a nice guy
or if he was rude to people. They didn’t ask if he had friends or loved
ones, and it apparently didn’t matter. Three grown men tied him to a
truck and dragged him down the road in Jasper, Tx., leaving a trail
of blood and his mangled head, neck and right arm behind. These
men didn’t know him. All they knew was that he was black,
therefore they didn’t like him.
What does this one poor individual have to do with an entire
race of people? Was Bryd the spokeman for African-Americans?
Was he a great leader that threated their well being? No. He was just
another guy, walking down the road at the wrong place, at the wrong
time. He could have been me, because who he was didn’t matter. All
that mattered was that he was black. Any black person would have
done for these three murderers. Me, my mother, my father, some of
the people reading this editorial right now, it could have been you,
because it didn’t matter whether he was rich or poor, educated or
ignorant, gay or straight, light or dark skinned. He was black and that
was a good enough reason to take the power of God and determine
the fate of another human beings life.
Besides AIDS and rapists, racism like that is probably the only
other thing that frightens me. The thought that it could have been any
black person they could have decided to kill frightens me, and to die
in such an undignifying, senseless way, to die as a result of ignorance
and hatred frightens me. And this makes me sad that some things in
America haven’t changed. I wonder what they thought they would
accomplish by killing a man.
My mother used to tell me when I was young and didn’t
understand something like this that some people were just evil. Let’s
just say my mother didn’t believe in Anne Frank’s message that deep
down inside all people were good. I was raised to understand that
this was the way thing are. People will hate you enough to kill you
over something you can’t control, and that is who you are. I was told
to understand that some people were evil and beyond saving, and as
much as I didn’t want to believe that as a child, I knew that this was
the only way to explain how cruel other human beings can be to one
another. 1 still don’t accept the hatred in this world, but I’ve learn to
understand that it .is there and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.
Some people like to pretend that racism is dead, but the only
thing that is dead right now is James Bryd Jr.

The Ridiculous Extrem es
o f Kenneth Starr

Remembering O klahom a
Virginia Moser, who helped
retrieve dead babies from the
rubble o f the bombed Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahom a City, hears them
crying in her nightmares. For
many Americans, the nightmare
of the Oklahoma City bombing is
of such enorm ity it will not
soon fade.
The sentencing o f Terry
Nichols, convicted of plotting the
bombing that ended 168 lives
April 19, 1995, does offer a
kind
o f closure.
Nichols,
convicted of conspiracy and
eight involuntary manslaughter
counts, was sentenced to life
behind bars without possibility of
parole.
His
attorneys
are
appealing. His co-conspirator,
Timothy McVeigh, has already
been sentenced to death.
But in sequestering Nichols
from society, U.S. District Judge
Richard Matsch delivered more
than a sentence. He delivered a
message that no doubt means
more to the rest of the nation than
to a defendant who displayed no
emotion, but just sat and stared.
M atsch called N ichols an
“enemy of the Constitution.”
With
that
statem ent,
Matsch gave voice to the belief
that Nichols and McVeigh were
not merely m urderers — as
grossly horrific as their crime
was — but traitors in every sense
of the word.

from the June 9
Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal

If
W hitew ater
special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr weren’t
zealous in his search for
information, he’d be as ignorant
as a tree toad about almost
everything h e’s investigating.
The Clintons’ lawyers w on’t give
up much beyond the president’s
home address without a fight,
even if it’s a fight they’re sure to
lose. Take, for exam ple, the
recent claim of executive
privilege to prevent Mr. Starr
from interviewing some White
House aides. That claim should
have been a skit on “Saturday
Night Live,” not a case on a
federal court docket. The court
rightly rejected it.
But Mr. Starr can go to
ridiculous extremes himself. That
is the case with his effort to force
the late Vincent Foster’s lawyer
to hand over notes from a
conversation a few days before
the White House aide committed
suicide. Mr. Starr’s prosecutorial
curiosity is understandable, but
it’s ridiculous that to satisfy it,
he’d expect to set aside the ageold
legal
protection
for
confidential
conversations
between lawyer and client.
Mr. Starr’s zealousness has
forced questions that a more
discreet prosecutor might have
resolved in other ways, such as
whether Secret Service agents
may be required to testify about
the president they protect. But
“discreet” and “Starr” are words
seldom used together. He is so
intently
focused
on
his
investigation that he seems to
think other values are of
secondary importance. It's up to
the
courts
to
m aintain
perspective.

from the June 9
Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, on
Kenneth Starr

W hitew ater isn ’t W atergate
The U.S. Suprem e Court
has turned down W hitew ater
independent counsel Kenneth
Starr’s request for a quick ruling
on w hether Secret Service
officers and Deputy W hite House
Counsel Bruce Lindsey can
be required to testify before a
grand jury.
But in denying him a ruling,
the justices may still have offered
him an opinion.
To the justices — and to the
American people — Whitewater,
m eaning the whole m ass of
issues
now
under
S tarr’s
surveillance, sim ply is not
Watergate.
Neither is the case of Starr
vs. Clinton comparable to the
Oklahoma City bombing or to a
presidential plot to m urder a
political foe, analogies raised by
Starr in seeking records of
form er
intern
M onica
Lewinsky’s book purchases and
in seeking to compel testimony
of Secret Service agents.
W hat’s truly extraordinary is
that Starr still seem s to be
searching for an offense to pin on
the president.
Starr and his defenders point
to his legal rights to pursue every
step h e’s taken. But w hat’s
missing here isn’t precedent, it’s
perspective.
He needs perspective.
We need a president.

I think people curse too
much. I’ll admit I do, too. But
I’m trying to stop. I like using
those words (for emphasis and of
course to make fun of people),
but they are starting to become
way overused.
Even kids are cursing, and
some people think it’s cute. I
remember back in grade school,
it was cool to say damn or its
equivilant. But now five-yearolds are shooting out the big
“F!” It’s insane. I didn’t start
using that one on a regular basis
until I was at least 13.
My friend, the wacky pro­
wrestler, has been called every
nasty four-letter word in the
book by ankle biters. That’s
when I knew it was time for
something different.
I’m going to make a
conscious effort to start using
other words of expression. I
think it will make people sit up
and notice. Of course it will take
a while to get the right words
down, but perhaps some loyal
readers will let me know if I ’m
on the right track.
Here are a few possible
examples:
“I’ve had just about enough
of your sassafrass!”
“Blow it out your Aunt
Hilda!”
“Take that, you son of a
botched operation!”
“Eat salt and die, you old
goat-sniffer!”
“That was my last dollar, you
Mother-may-I!”
And we all know that the use
of the middle finger, the old bird,
is way over-done. Instead, I'm
going to give people the thumbon-the-nose-with-raspberries! It
will really tickle their angry
bone and might cause a little
stress-inducing road rage.

In a time when any
four piece garage band

can ’t im agine not doing
it,” Scalzo said.
One o f the standout
tracks on the album is
“G O D .
(G ood
Old
D ays),” w hich blends
the vocalist’s harm onies
with horns for an upbeat
ride, rem niscient o f late
‘60s Beatles.
F astball
even
convinced singer Poe to
add guest vocals on the
funky track “W hich Way
to the Top?”
“She was w orking in
the studio next d o o r,”
Scalzo said, “ and we
asked her to do the song.”
“I sang the harm ony
for her,” Z u n ig a said.
“She made a couple of
changes and im m ediately
nailed it. T hen she
freestyled over the bridge
section and the w hole thing
came out great.”
The group is w rapping up
their current tour before joining
the H O R D Efest later this
summer. By then, the trio
should have a second hit on the
radio, and they will have found
the way to the top.

■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
Norm Macdonald has made a comedic career of
being overly smarmy charming. His schtick usually
involves saying something hilariously tasteless with a
monotone deadpan delivery, which is exactly what he
does in his first feature length movie, “Dirty Work.”
Mcdonald plays himself basically as Mitch, an out of
work loser with a portly best friend named Sam (Artie
Shaw). The two open a revenge for hire business in
order to buy a new heart for their father played by Jack
Warden. The film is chock full of cameos from people
like Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, Gary
Coleman and Don Rickies.
This is pretty much an Adam Sandler movie that does
not star Adam Sandler. There is much silliness, and most
of the laughs come from the cameo players. Macdonald
does not hold up well for a full-length feature. His
deadpan dry wit even grew tired when he did the news
on “Saturday Night Live.” This movie definitely suffers
from too much Norm syndrome.
Macdonald is funnier when he isn’t playing himself.
But the rest of the cast and tasteless jokes provide some
comic value, making this effort not a total loss.

24 high school basketball teams showed up and participated
in a tournament hosted by SIUE last weekend. Nashville (III.)
was edged by Hazelwood Central (Mo.) by one point in the
final game.
A new group of teams will arive this coming weekend and
compete in the tournament. Last weekend, teams were mostly
single A teams. This weekend the teams will be mostly
AA teams.
