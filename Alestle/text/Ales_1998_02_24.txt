Security walk may lead to solutions to housing hazards
Legate leads the way to Cougar Village
improvement with input from residents.
■ BY STEPHEN WHITE
STAFF REPORTER
University Housing’s first
“Security Walk” was held last
Thursday at 5:45 p.m. Its focus
was to get residents’ input on
housing safety.
Robert Legate, assistant
director of University Housing
Facilities Management, led the
walk. He called it a “pro-active
attempt to gain information to try
to make things better for the
students.
“By being pro-active we can
avoid issues before they become
problems,” he said.
The “Security Walk” was
Legate’s idea and was the first
exercise of its kind to be held
at SIUE.
The walk encompassed the
31 buildings on the 400 side of
Cougar Village and Tower Lake

Apartments and several buildings
on the 500 side. It started at the
Commons Building, the central
focal point for the administrative
offices within Cougar Village.
The purpose of the walk was
to locate and try to find solutions
to safety hazards such as poor
lighting and unsafe walkways. In
a safety and security survey,
students rated various aspects
of safety in Cougar Village
as good, fair or poor and
provided their own comments to
be taken into consideration by
University Housing.
Because of the difficulty
maintenance
workers
had
experienced with scraping snow
and ice off the pavement,
crumbling asphalt roadways and
sidewalks were deemed as a
safety hazard by residents of
Cougar Village.

Anthrax suspect and informant met in Colorado at Denver conference
DENVER (AP) — The man
accused of possessing deadly
anthrax spores in Las Vegas and
the informant who set him up for
arrest met last August at a Denver
conference, where the suspect
gave a lecture, “Are We Headed
for a Biological Pearl Harbor?”
The
informant,
Ron
Rockwell of Las Vegas, is a

twice-convicted extortionist who
has been marketing a medical
machine he claims can clean
toxins
from
the
blood,
including anthrax.
Rockwell met Larry Wayne
Harris on a circuit of conferences
and trade shows dedicated to
conspiracy theories, New Age
spirituality, alternative medicines

and militia survivalism.
The Denver conference of
Global Sciences was held Aug. 711
at
a
Holiday
Inn
in Northglenn.
Global Sciences is a meeting
ground for believers in flying
saucers, magnetic healing, New
World
Order
conspiracies,
militia and patriot groups, and

New Age spirituality.
An attorney for William
Leavitt Jr., the second man
arrested Wednesday with Harris,
said his client believes Rockwell
set them up because Leavitt
and Harris had doubts about
whether Rockwell’s machine
actually worked.
The attorney, Kirby Wells,

said Leavitt claims the men had
anthrax vaccine, which Harris
has been promoting in patriot and
survivalist
circles.
The
government believes it was
deadly spores. Testing by this
weekend should determine who
is correct.

SECURITY--------from page 1

“For those who aren’t
familiar with the apartment
complex, we are currently in the
midst of a complete asphalt
renovation program on campus,”
Legate said. “The lots have been
completed on the 400 side.
However, this spring into early
summer the roadway will be
replaced as will the remaining
lots on the 500 side.”
Another safety concern
addressed at the program was
inadequate lighting, especially on
the 400 side. Recently, to
improve the dispersion of light at
the apartment buildings and
outlying areas, several trees were
trimmed and pruned at their
lowest limbs.
“When these buildings were
built, I don’t think they thought
of the repercussions of how huge
these trees would be today,”
Legate said. “The idea is to get
the limbs up to let more light in
so we can improve the turf. Also,
it does wonders for the lighting.
“If you look at the other
clusters of apartments where we

haven’t
pruned
yet,
you
can really tell a difference,”
Gary
Heininger,
Legate’s
assistant said.
Low hanging limbs can also
be a fire hazard.
“A recommendation was
made several years ago by the
fire department to raise the
trees,” Legate said, pointing at a
giant oak tree near Cougar Lake.
“There was a resident that loved
that tree and he didn’t want us to
prune it. But the limbs were
hanging so low that the fire truck
couldn’t get through. It was a
beautiful tree and we hated to cut
it. That just goes to show how far
we will go with the safety end of
things in mind.”
Legate mentioned that the
lights for the basketball and
tennis
courts
have
been
completely renovated on both
sides of Cougar Village Road. He
also said that in the future there
will be continuous lighting all the
way through Cougar Village road
to the four-way stop.
One resident told Legate that

a group of bushes on the side of a
slope next to a laundromat near
Building 429 should be removed
because “people can hide
behind them.”
However, Legate said that
the bushes act as a buffer zone,
improving the landscape and
helping to keep residents from
walking down the hill.
“Another reason that we
haven’t taken the bushes out is
that people, even though they’re
not supposed to, drive through
this area and that slope is pretty
steep,” Heininger said. “We’re
kind of in a Catch-22.”
Legate
said
he
was
challenged when it came to
finding a way to deter residents
from driving on the sidewalks in
Cougar Village.
“When I started over
fourteen years ago, they had
gates set up at the entrances and
they were chained with locks and
a steel post,” he said. “We had to
think about how we got the
service trucks in, the fire trucks
in during emergencies, and also

the people who work with student
deliveries had to get in. The only
deterrent I can think of is better
enforcement by campus police.”
The buildings on the 400
side were built in the late 60s and
those on the 500 side were built
in the early 70s. Many still need
renovation. Approximately $10.5
million will be spent to add new
balconies, siding, windows,
kitchens and baths. From a safety
standpoint, the aluminum wiring
and interior lighting on the 500
side poses a fire hazard, so it will
be replaced as well. According to
Legate, construction should
begin in May.
Pat Rzewnicki, coordinator
for Risk Management, identified
stove fires as the number one
safety hazard at Cougar Village.
“We usually have at least one
substantial stove fire each year,”
she said. “Many of them destroy
entire kitchens. People should
never leave their cooking
items unattended.”
Residents made several
comments regarding safety

concerns on both the 400 and 500
sides. On the 400 side, residents
said that people drive too fast on
the inner roadways; people drive
on the sidewalks and not the
inner roadways; Cougar Village
Road near Building 411 is dark;
and there is a problem with mud
near 411, 412, and 414 to 415. On
the 500 side, residents said that
the breezeways seemed closed
off and have hiding places;
sidewalks are poorly placed;
lighting needs improvement; and
more sidewalks are needed.
The University Housing
Advisory Committee is looking
for advice from residents of
Cougar Village. Residents who
see malfunctioning light poles or
other
safety
hazards
are
encouraged to call ext. 2070.

Letters to the editor
History lies in my aunt’s house
Assorted editorials from Ifound lives and stories I never knew in the home o f Josephine Myricks
I don’t remember how old I was when it happened, but I was still living in my old
around the United States
house, the one I was bom in when my great, great aunt Josephine passed away. It was
Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers on
Tucker execution, Clinton's credibility, and Charlie Trie.
Le Monde, Paris, on I\icker
execution:

According
to
Amnesty
International, as of October 1997,
100 countries out of 193 had
abolished the death penalty. The
only Western power which still
practices this punishment, the
United States, figures among the
93 countries resisting abolition, in
the good company of China and
Iraq among others.
Karla Faye Tucker, just
executed in Texas, was certainly
not innocent. She had never denied
the double murder, committed in
horrible conditions, for which she
was condemned to death in 1984.
Many Americans therefore think
that justice has been served.
Invoking the adage, “An eye for an
eye, a tooth for a tooth,” they
subscribe to the barbarous
assumption that murderers must be
punished by execution.
(But) as Robert Badinter said
when he obtained the abolition of
the death penalty in France in
1981: nothing can justify “a justice
that kills.”
The Lima News, Lima,
Ohio, on President C linton’s
credibility:

Allegations
of
sexual
misconduct and perjury engulfed
the president for a week before he
told the American public that he
did not have a sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
Most Americans believe
Lewinsky’s claims. But many
don’t care even if the Arkansas
Wonder has lied to the public.
Clinton’s authority ultimately
rests on his word. When Bill
Clinton threatens Iraq or promises
to fix Social Security, Americans
and world leaders are supposed to
believe him. But who can possibly
believe anything this man says?
The programs the president

promised during last week’s State
of the Union Address won’t cost
much, he says. But what will we
say a few years down the road
when the costs boost the deficit or
eat further into our pay?
Akron
(Ohio)
Beacon
Journal, on Charlie Trie:

On
Tuesday,
Monica
Lewinsky fled to Los Angeles, and
Charlie
Trie
returned
to
Washington. Their paths didn’t
cross. But they do have something
in common. They both stand at the
center of scandals swirling around
President Clinton. In many ways,
the one involving Trie is the far
more disturbing.
Trie has been charged with
arranging a scheme in which he
allegedly collected money from
foreign businessmen, who could
not legally contribute to American
political
campaigns,
and
distributed the cash to “straw
donors” who were citizens and
legal residents. The “straw
donors” then made donations to
the
Democratic
National
Committee.
Among the charges against
Trie is the allegation that he used
the fund-raising scheme to
purchase access for himself and
others to top administration
officials, including the president.
Did he and friends receive favors
in return for the money? For the
moment, that is unclear.
For 16 months, we’ve argued
the
scandal
requires
an
investigation by an independent
counsel. The president may have
abused the powers of his office to
achieve a campaign advantage.
With the surrender of Trie, the
Department of Justice has gained
new momentum, even a dose of
credibility, for its investigation.
Monica Lewinsky? What will
Charlie Trie say?

February when she died and she’d left the home to my father.
All my memories of my aunt were foggy, but I knew that I had loved her. I can still
picture her thin, pale frame sitting in the house, fussing with her older sister, Bertha. I still
remember the smells of food I didn’t like to eat, like duck, filling the house I can still see
the pictures on the wall. When I finally knew Josphine Myricks, she was an old woman
Danielle who was my father’s great aunt. She obviously loved him dearly, because she spoke so
Belton
well of him and his brothers and was a constant spoiler of them. But I still didn’t pay that
much attention to her, until she died.
When we inherited the house, we found so many things. At the time, I was into stamp collecting and
was fascinated about how my aunts had kept almost every stamp and letter they’d ever come across.
Then, in all the rush to find things and move things around, I spotted something gold and shiny near the
curtains in the living room. When I brought it to my mother, who was busy sorting out papers, she told
me that it was probably just part of the curtain and to ignore it. But I told her to look at it again. Finally,
we both looked at it, and my mother told me that it was Aunt Josie’s wedding band. She told me to wear
it, and not to lose it. I still wear it today and look at the inscripton often: 6-16-30, their wedding date.
From there on, I began to discover an entire family history I never knew about. Soon stories of long
ago about my aunt flowed from my father’s mouth, causing me to fill with laughter, yet at the same time
a saddness because I never really knew her.
Josephine Myricks was one of three sisters, like myself, only she was the baby. She looked almost
whiter than most women I knew, but I knew that as far as she was concerned, she was as black as could
be. She was a traveler. She was intelligent and bossy. In her day, she was one of the most beautiful women
you could ever see. Her husband was John Myricks; he was a Buffalo Soldier in the U.S. military.
Everyday, I learn something new from their lives.
Though I hardly knew them, I feel as if they have always been with me. I feel we all have a history
and it is rewarding when we leam it. I know it was for me.

An open letter for help with important
research on a former SIUE student
I am researching a book on
the life and death of Nancy Dean
Morgan who graduated from
SIUE with a bachelor’s degree in
social welfare in 1969. After
graduating, Morgan went to work
as a community organizer for
VISTA, Volunteers in Service to
AMerica (the “Domestic Peace
Corps”) in Madison County, N.
C. She was murdered in that
isolated Appalcian mountain
community in June of 1970, a

crime that has never been solved.
By all accounts, Morgan
personified the idealism and
dedication - as well as some of
the free-spirited naivete - of the
1960s era. I would appriciate
hearing from anyone now in the
Edwardsville area who may have
known Nancy Dean Morgan
when she was a student, or who
can recall what campus life was
like at that time.

Using tree bark, leaves, grass, and plants students make paper.
U BY NEIL BEITZALL

^

PHOTOGRAPHER
Jo Staeley, a visiting lecturer from the University of
Missouri at Columbia, conducted an afternoon workshop

showing students how to make flat sheets as well as
three-dimensional objects like bowls and books
with paper. The lecturer was conducted for Laura
Strand’s fibers class at SIUE on Feb. 12.
To make the paper, bark, leaves, grass, plants and
vegetables of all kinds are chopped up,
then boiled in soda ash, breaking down
the fibers to form pulp. The pulp is then
cooled in a large tub and stretched over
a fine screen. A vacuum cleaner is then
used to pull off the pulp onto another
screen where it must sit and dry
overnight or longer. The paper can then
be molded and combined to form
various objects.

Sri Lankan journalist in serious condition after
assault by police over suspected gang ties
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)
— A Sri Lankan journalist who
wrote about illicit liquor gangs
was assaulted by the police, who
claimed the reporter had links
with the gangsters, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
Pradeep Dharmaratne, 24, a
correspondent for the state-run
Dinamina newspaper in the
central town of Aranayake, was
hospitalized
with
damaged
kidneys after his arrest on Feb.
16, the Sunday Times reported.
The Kandy Media Foundation,
a journalists’ watchdog group in
the nearby city of Kandy, has

written to President Chandrika
Kumaratunga
asking
for
an investigation.
Local police have launched an
internal investigation into the
complaint by the journalist, said
Senior Superintendent Henry
Perera, a police spokesman, but
the government may decide later
in the week whether it will send a
special team of detectives
from Colombo.
Dharmaratne, who had written
about the liquor gangs in a Feb.
10 article, said uniformed
policemen broke down his door at
midnight,
beat
him
up

and took him to the local
police station.
He was kept in a cell for nearly
a day and beaten several times by
senior officers who threatened to
cut
off
his
hands
if he wrote about the liquor
racket again.
The following night, he was
taken to an illegal distillery,
where he was forced to place his
fingerprints on bottles and barrels
of liquor.
He was produced before a
local magistrate the next day, to
face police allegations he had
links with the gangs. He was

ANTHRAX --------from page 1

It is illegal to possess the vaccine.
They were arrested Wednesday
night when they arrived at a
medical
office
building,
ostensibly to test the machine
with the substance they brought
along.
Harris and Leavitt planned to
pay $2 million for the machine,
according to a criminal complaint
filed by the FBI in Las Vegas.
The FBI complaint alleges
that Harris and Leavitt told
Rockwell
they
possessed
military-grade anthrax. That
relatively
small
quantity
theoretically would be enough to
kill tens of thousands of people.
But delivering the spores to
the victims would present a
logistical problem.
Harris was convicted in Ohio
in 1995 of fraudulently obtaining
bubonic plague toxins. He is a
former member of the racist
group Aryan Nations in Idaho,
which, in a November interview
with U.S. News and World
Report, supported the Aryan
Nations’ program of establishing
a whites-only nation in five
Pacific Northwest states.
In the interview, Harris
warned that his associates
would strike back at the
government with biological
weapons if provoked.
“If they arrest a bunch of our
guys, they get a test tube in the
mail. How many cities are you
willing to lose before you back
off? At what point do you say, ‘If
these guys want to go off to the
Northwest and have five states
declared to be their own free
and independent country, let them
do it’?”

Three-hour police standoff ends in suicide
LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) —
A Michigan fugitive is dead after
barricading himself inside a
Lexington home with a woman
and turning on the gas as police
tried to arrest him.
The man cut his throat as
police broke into the home after a
three-hour standoff Friday night,
Lexington police Maj. Anthony
Beatty said. The man died at the
University of Kentucky Hospital
and had not been identified by
the Fayette County coroner
Saturday morning.

Beatty said police decided to
enter the home because they
feared the situation would end
with a fatality.
“He was making threats to
harm himself,” Beatty said.
Upon entering the home,
police arrested author Gayl
Jones, an obscure but acclaimed
fiction writer featured in the Feb.
16 issue of Newsweek. Police
said she was taken to Eastern
State Hospital after threatening to
hurt herself.
Beatty said Jones might be

married to the man who
killed himself.
According to the Newsweek
story, Jones is married to Bob
Higgins, who was arrested in
1983 at a gay rally in Ann Arbor,
Mich. Jones taught at the
University of Michigan at
the time.
According to an Ann Arbor
newspaper, Higgins fought with
rally participants, ranting about
AIDS and “burning in hell.” He
then brandished a shotgun and
was arrested by authorities.

Higgins later wrote a letter to
President
Ronald
Reagan
protesting the charges.
His wife, Jones, resigned
from her teaching position at the
university over the incident. The
two then retreated from the
public eye and Higgins was
convicted
in
absentia,
Newsweek reported.
Friday’s incident began
about 6 p.m. as police tried to
serve an Ann Arbor warrant on
the man at the Lexington home.
Beatty said the warrant was for

assault with a deadly weapon.
When the man barricaded
himself inside the home, a
hostage team was called to the
scene. Soon, police noticed an
odor of gas coming from the
building. They evacuated part of
the neighborhood and called the
fire department and gas company
to turn the line off.
Police then broke into the
home, as the man and woman
inside were threatening to harm
themselves and each other,
police said.

SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) — A
5-year-old girl whose father
allegedly shot her during an
argument with his estranged wife
has died without regaining
consciousness.
Kendyl Smith died Friday
morning at Community Medical
Center after surgeons removed a
.25-caliber bullet from her head,
officials said.
Robert Smith Jr. was in
Wayne County Prison. Police
said Smith tried to shoot his 2year-old son, Robert Smith III,
Wednesday but his gun jammed.
He was arrested early
Thursday at a police roadblock.

State police in Honesdale said
Smith went to the South Sterling
home of his wife, Susan Smith, to
get a protection order against him
dropped and to discuss an
upcoming custody hearing.
A police affidavit said Smith
kissed his daughter and told her
“good-bye” before shooting her,
then grabbed his son by the hair
and pressed the gun against
his head.
Wayne County District
Attorney Mark R. Zimmer said
he may seek the death penalty if
Smith is convicted of homicide.
Smith also faces charges of
attempted homicide and assault.

Former mayor sentenced to a year in jail
CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) —
The former mayor of a St. Louis
suburb has been sentenced to
one year in jail for financing his
re-election
campaign
and
subsequent victory party with
taxpayer dollars.
St. Louis County Circuit
Judge Maura McShane also
fined former Wellston Mayor
Robert Powell $1,500 for two
counts of felony theft. She
levied an additional $1,000
fine
for
a
misdemeanor
conviction that involved the

purchase
of
$115
in roses for his wife at
Wellston’s expense.
Powell was taken in
handcuffs from a Clayton
courtroom Friday, after he
was sentenced.
Even after his convictions
by a jury on Dec. 3, Powell tried
to hold onto his office, or the
trappings of the office. He
fought with political foes on the
City Council over his seat and
over such perks as the city’s
Buick Roadmaster and city-

issued credit cards.
Powell officially resigned
Feb. 10, after threats he would
be impeached or removed from
office by court order.
Pow ell’s family members
said Friday that he had been
framed
by
his
political
opponents. Prosecuting Attorney
Robert P. McCulloch said
Powell was convicted because
he stole money, and that the
sentence
should
prove
a
deterrent to other politicians
considering using public funds

for private purposes.
Wellston taxpayers paid
more than $7,000 for Powell’s
re-election campaign and victory
party, prosecutor Kelly Hill has
said. But Powell denied that he
ever billed equipment, supplies
or food and drink to the city
in 1994.
He also denied having an
affair with Rose Jackson,
Wellston’s
former
finance
director. Jackson was the state’s
main witness against Powell.
Powell’s attorney cited

Powell’s age of 72 and asked
McShane to give Powell
probation. McShane denied that
request but allowed Powell to go
free, pending appeal, if he comes
up with $30,000 - $10,000 more
than the bond he made when he
was arrested two years ago.
Powell was impeached as
mayor in 1982, then he won a
city council seat in 1987. He lost
a race for mayor in 1991 by four
votes but won a special election
for mayor in 1992. He was re­
elected in 1994.

After triple slaying, Georgetown Britain warns Saddam
that time is running out
Starbucks coffee bar reopens
WASHINGTON (AP) —
The Georgetown-area Starbucks,
where three employees were slain
last summer, has reopened with
a pledge to donate all store
profits to anti-violence groups in
the city.
District police have made no
arrests seven months after the
murders in the coffee bar in a
fashionable section of the city,
where customers have included
such luminaries as Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright
and former House Speaker
Tom Foley.
Area residents hope the
reopening
will
help
the
community.
“The trauma of what went on
inside was so violent,” said Lisa

Holmes, drinking coffee there
Friday. A nurse who lives two
blocks away, Holmes went to
Starbucks almost daily before its
closing. “Memorializing it is a
ritual in the process of healing.”
Three maple panels adorned
with three aluminum blades of
grass serve as a reminder of Mary
Caitrin Mahoney, Emory Allen
Evans
and
Aaron
David
Goodrich, who were shot while
closing the store July 6.
With repainted walls, new
artwork and a redesigned lounge,
the store is committed to staying
in business.
“They got rid of anything old
that would remind us of the
past,” said Suzanne Hughes, who
used to work there. “The

atmosphere is very positive.
We’re happy we’re moving on.”
The Starbucks killings are
one of two unresolved triple
homicides in the nation’s capital.
The police department “has
aggressively investigated this
case and continues to follow up
on the hundreds of leads we have
received and developed,” Lt.
Brian McAllister said in a
briefing Friday.
The company is offering
$100,000 for information leading
to an arrest, and company
regional director Dean Torrenga
said, “We’re not going to rest.”
The Community Foundation
of the National Capital Region
will distribute the store’s profits.

LONDON
(AP)
Cautiously
welcoming the
announcement of a U.N. deal
with Iraq, Britain said Monday
that President Saddam Hussein
has “moved a long way.”
“If you look at where
Saddam has been over the last
month — he began by saying
there should be no visits to the
presidential sites, then he
offered one visit,” Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said in a
BBC radio interview.
“Now, if he has actually
signed up to what was in the
mandate that Kofi (U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan)
took to Baghdad, he has
agreed to repeat visits as well,”
added Cook.
“Now that is a lot of
movement in one month, if it is
the case, and it only has
happened because he has...
known the resolve of the
international community.”
Cook spoke soon after
Annan announced in Baghdad

he had signed a deal to end the
impasse over U.N. inspections
of suspected sites for producing
weapons of mass destruction.
Britain is America’s most
enthusiastic ally in being
prepared to attack Iraq unless
Saddam backs down.
Cook said a deal was
possible, in particular, because
the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council, the
United States, Russia, China,
Britain and France, has all
agreed “the same bottom line.”
Cook said the deal must
stipulate that U.N. weapons
inspectors are in control of the
operation, but Britain had no
objection
to
diplomats
accompanying the inspectors.
“What we could not accept
would be an ‘UNSCOM minus’
which
undermines
the
effectiveness of UNSCOM...We
must look at the agreement to
make sure we have UNSCOM
plus,” Cook added.

Building prisons, fewer paroles pose predicament
LANSING, Mich. (AP) —
Members of Michigan’s parole
board get it coming and going —
fuming prisoners denied freedom
on one hand and weeping
relatives of victims on the other.
Their job isn’t easy. All they
can do is sympathize with the
victims, duck inmates’ missiles
and tell themselves they’re
protecting the public.
“We’ve all been spit on, hit. I
got knocked out in Muskegon,”
said Stephen Marschke, a burly
former Berrien County sheriff
who now heads the panel that
decides whether to keep inmates
behind bars or let them free.
“We’ve all ... had paper
thrown at us. One inmate threw a
bag of feces,” he said.
“These aren’t people who
take disappointment well.”
It’s just as hard facing the
people who sob during a parole
board hearing about a relative
who’s been savagely killed or
raped or mutilated.
“I hate Fridays,” Marschke
said. “I know every time we meet
with victims, you are going to
hear these gut-wrenching stories.
Your heart just goes out to these
people who have tragically lost a
loved one.”
Marschke and his colleagues
can take some solace in evidence
that Michigan’s tougher new
parole rules seem to be working although there’s a down side, too.
Those
same dangerous
prisoners kept behind bars longer
help jam cells to the point that
new prisons may be needed at the

cost of millions of dollars.
The stricter approach has
differing effects on convicts.
Some inmates rebel at the hard
time they find themselves
serving, while others adapt and
live for the day - maybe - when
they can breathe free again.
“I have changed my life,”
Henry Bonner, 46, said at his
January parole hearing at Carson
City
Regional
Corrections
Facility. Early this month, he was
granted parole and was expected
to be freed by May at the latest.
Bonner is serving a life
sentence for killing a man in a
failed drug buy almost three
decades ago. The hearing was his
chance to convince officials he
deserved freedom.
“I have changed my life. I
was young and wild. I have
grown out of that,” he said.
The Michigan Parole Board
- 10 citizens with backgrounds in
law enforcement, criminal justice
or counseling - is on the front
line of Michigan’s fight against
crime. As much as the police and
prosecutors, what they decide
affects public safety.
According to the state, the
percent of paroles granted to
eligible inmates dropped to 55.7
percent in 1994-97 from 66.1
percent in 1988-91. Meanwhile,
the percentage of prisoners
serving their maximum sentence
has gone from 19.2 percent in
1988-91 to 34.8 percent in
1994-97.
The department says 71
percent of prisoners denied

parole are serving time for
violent crimes. And 87 percent
have
committed
major
misconducts while behind bars.
After a drop in paroles
earlier this decade, the number of
paroles is edging up again as the
prison
population
swells.
Michigan
approved
10,306
parole
requests
in
1996,
compared to 9,678 in 1995,
11,854 in 1992 and just 3,856
in 1985.
And parole denials are down
lately - 7,482 in 1996 compared
to 7,923 in 1995 and 2,694
in 1985.
According to Marschke, the
Parole Board granted 8,363
paroles
in
1997
through
November, 54 percent of those
considered. It denied parole
7,227 times, or 46 percent of
the time.
“We’re
a
lot
more
conservative than the parole
boards
up
to
1992,”
Marschke said.
The 1992 changes altered the
makeup of the Parole Board from
Civil Service members to
appointees
of
the
state
corrections director. The new
appointees were in no mood to
be lenient.
The tougher policy stemmed
in part from a crime spree
embarked on by Leslie Allen
Williams, who kidnapped 14year-old Michelle Urbain and her
16-year-old sister, Melissa, near
their Fenton home in September
1991. The girls’ bodies were
found several months later in a

Williams, who committed
the crime while free on parole
after serving seven years of a 25year sentence for sexual assault,
also raped and killed two other
girls that fall and winter and
abducted another girl and one
woman. He now is serving
five life sentences for the
four murders.
Outraged citizens supported
making it tougher to get parole.
But the policy has had
consequences. Michigan’s prison
population hit 42,287 as of Jan. 1,
up from 35,131 in 1992. At least
part of the increase is due to
fewer inmates winning their
freedom from the board.
To deal with the increase,
Gov. John Engler has asked
lawmakers to approve 5,400 new
beds over the next four years. He
said it will cost $186 million to
build two new prisons and add
onto eight more to get the
necessary space.
The state already is sending
some inmates to other states to
alleviate the strain on the state
prisons. It sent 39 to West
Virginia in December, and plans
to send more.
Norman Donker, Midland
County prosecutor and president
of the Prosecuting Attorneys
Association
of
Michigan,
approves
of
the
tougher
parole policies.
“I don’t think you can lay the
problem
for
(prison)
overcrowding on the parole
board,” he said. “We’ve been
very impressed with the changes
that have taken place with the
parole board. In looking at the
public safety aspect ... it’s not a
rubber stamp.”
But the endorsement of
Michigan parole practices is
hardly unanimous. Kay Perry,
head of the Michigan chapter of
Citizens
United
for
the
Rehabilitation of Errants, said
Michigan is badly handling its
prisoner load.

“We are locking up way too
many people for far too long,”
she said. “We should be locking
up only violent offenders ... The
system has never hired enough
therapists (to treat inmates). This
is a fairly mean time for
government in Michigan.”
Laura Sager, Michigan
director of Families Against
Mandatory Minimums, said the
state prison population is tightly
linked to drug and alcohol
addiction. With treatment, those
inmates could be paroled.
“Michigan is warehousing
thousands o f individuals who
could benefit from rigorous
treatment and followup to
return them to taxpayer status,”
she said.
Corrections officials said
most of the least violent
offenders have been paroled out
of the prison system. What’s left
are the most dangerous convicts
serving the longest terms.
Now, more than a third of
prisoners - nearly 15,000 - are
serving terms of 10 years or
more, and the number has tripled
since 1985.
Those
serving
lengthy
sentences include sex offenders.
The parole approval rate for sex
offenders, a rapidly growing part
of the prison population, is only
16 percent and unlikely to go
higher, officials said.
“The pool of people they’re
(parole board members are)
seeing is much more violent
as we’ve diverted (nonviolent)
people
from
prison,”
said
Corrections
Director
Kenneth McGinnis.
Even those who get out on
parole aren’t always home free.
Many more inmates than before
are being returned to prison
because of parole violations and
because
of
new
felony
convictions while on parole.
“We’ve been making parole
tougher for a long tim e,”
McGinnis said. “(But) they keep
coming back.”

I hate to complain, but I am
starting to grow tired of the
greedy leeches I keep coming
across. I like free stuff as much
as the next person, but some
people don’t know where to
draw the line.
Example. I went to the famed
Soulard Mardi Gras parade
Saturday afternoon. It was odd
to see so many children
involved in an event that is
highly known as a carnival of
indulgences like food, drink and
sex. Oh well, the children
weren’t much of a problem.
They were just in the way and
got pushed, stepped on and
smacked in the head with my
arm (all accidental instances, I
assure you).
My friends and I secured a
nice area on the street to watch
the parade and to catch beads
that were being thrown by the
paraders. I understand that these
beads are a hot commodity. But
give me a break, it’s not as if at
the end of the day you can trade
them in for cash. People were
being ridiculous. They were
pushing strangers out of the
way, scouring the filthy ground
and pulling plastic strands of
beads away from children.
These were grown middle-aged
women! I didn’t get it. They
didn’t appear to be intoxicated,
which I could have expected.
Drunk people are easily amused,
especially by shiny things.
I won’t lie and say I didn’t
scream and wave in order to
catch some beads. I even did a
decent impression of a starving
French-revolution child (see Les
Miserables) begging for beads.

Their story is not highly publicized
but their legacy will not go ignored
■ BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
lack History Month is a time to
celebrate and remember those
who worked to make the world
a better place, be it through
invention,
inspiration
or
protection.
The buffalo soldiers were the 9th and 1Oth
Cavalry and 24th and 25th Infantry, who were
part of the United State’s armed forces during
the period after the Civil War and through
World War II.
Until recently, the buffalo soldiers have
been left out of many history textbooks. But a
proud few are attempting to teach others of
their legacy.
They were given their name by Native
Americans who called them buffalo soldiers
because their short, curly hair was like the hair
on the back of a buffalo’s neck. They were
also compared with the buffalo’s strength
and tenacity.
The buffalo soldiers protected and helped
expand the West in a time when the color of
their skin was still cause for great
discrimination even in the armed forces.
Therefore, the troops had to work harder to
receive the same amount of respect due a
white soldier.

B

The buffalo soldiers’ orders
included clearing Indians from the
West after the Civil War.
But the relations between the
black soldiers and the Indians
were unclear.
According to William Loren
Katz’ book “Black Indians” the
buffalo soldiers helped to relocate
some Indian families while some
Indians helped blacks to hide
during the slavery era.
Buffalo soldiers did not
necessarily agree with their orders
to fight the Indians, but they were
forced to follow the governmental
policies, Katz said.
Other duties included building
telegraph lines, repairing and building forts,
settling railroad disputes, helping settlers find a
place to live and protecting the settlers from
Indian attacks.
According to Katz, the desertion rate for
buffalo soldiers was the lowest in the Army.
They were also regarded as hard workers and
received praise from high-ranking officers.
They were not highly publicized as
defenders of the nation. It was not until 1992
that they were fully recognized as heroes. At
that time Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, honored the black
soldiers with a monument at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan.
It was Powell who had discovered ten
years earlier in 1982 the two walkways
that were the remnants of the homesite of
the Ninth and Tenth Calvaries. Carlton G.
Philpot, a Navy commander, raised the
$850,000 for the monument.
Sixteen years after his discovery the
soldiers are still being remembered.
Earlier this month, a re-creation of the
buffalo soldiers was on display at the St.
Louis Arch. The buffalo soldiers are also

being remembered with care by their
descendants. (See related story on page 9.)
The cable network TNT aired a film about
the buffalo soldiers in December. The film
starred and was produced by Danny Glover.
Another
group
working
toward
remembering the efforts of the buffalo soldiers
is America’s Buffalo Soldiers Re-Enactors
Association (ABSRA). The group was
founded in 1990.
“The whole thing started after we were
making a film called “Cry Vengeance.” It
featured the buffalo soldiers and we continued
from there,” Charles Long II, president and
CEO of ABSRA said.
Their goals are to educate young people
through discipline. They attempt to mold
young minds through early intervention. All of
their activities incorporate the history of the
buffalo soldiers.
ABSRA worked with the Smithsonian
Institute, the University of Oklahoma and
military organizations to do research for the
ambitious project.
Some of their services available are
educational lectures, film performances, a wild
West show, parades, documentaries, color
guard, honor guard and funeral detail.
With the help of organizations like ABSRA
and individuals like Colin Powell and Danny
Glover, someday the history of the buffalo
soldiers will be commonplace.

Remembering a soldier:

One family’s attempt to
keep history alive
U BY COREY STULCE
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
Most, if not all of the buffalo soldiers who defended
the nation from the end of the Civil War through World
War II are gone. The only thing that remains for
future generations are the photos, military records and
the memories.
Deloris Belton, great-niece to buffalo soldier John
Myricks, has gathered photos and records for her family
history. Belton has taken great care to keep the life of a
career soldier alive in book form.
Myricks joined the Army when he was very young
because work was scarce for black men Belton said. He
received training at the famed West Point Academy for
working with livestock.
From 1908-1940 through his 30-plus year career in
the Army, Myricks met and befriended such luminary
war heroes as General George S. Patton.
He left the Army on several occasions but according
to Belton, he could not stay away long. “He would
retire, but after a couple of years, he was so miserable
he joined again,” she said. Myricks was honorably
discharged from the army eight times.
Myricks was a big fan of military life. “He loved the
military. He told everyone to join. He said, ‘It makes a
man out of you,’ which is one myth I don’t believe,”
Belton said.
“It was all he ever talked about, though. He loved the
times he was there. Even after retiring, he would get up
and do all the exercises, the push-ups,” Belton said.
Besides caring for the livestock, Myricks also did
trick riding on the horses and was a member of the
Army’s track team.
Belton said one of his regrets was having to fight the
Indians. “Once you join the military, you don’t have the
option to say ‘I don’t want to do this.’”
Belton thinks it is important to remember the work
the buffalo soldiers did like guarding the stagecoaches
and forts, instead of the wars with the Indians.
“I don’t know why they don’t include them in the
[history] books. They helped settle the land, even
though they didn’t get any [for themselves]. He was
proud of the time he spent,” Belton said.
Myricks lived to be 96 and he died in 1981.

Drew Barrymore: She’s
come a long way baby
NEW YORK (AP) — If you believe
Drew Barrymore, the 23-year-old actress
hasn’t exactly matured into a knockout screen
goddess.
“My God, no! Look at me,” she insists,
turning her gaze downward. “Look at this.
That’s not sexy! I’m, like, such a geek.”
Despite a cherub’s face mounted on a
Jezebel’s body, Barrymore insists on her
utter geekiness during a recent interview
to promote her new movie, “The
Wedding Singer.”
“I’m not one of the hip people ” she says,
brushing her bleached-blond hair from her
porcelain skin. “I stick out like a sore
thumb in a crowd of the hip people. It’s
so embarrassing.”
Ah, who needs the hipsters, anyway?
These days, Barrymore — the child star
turned hellraiser, doesn't need to fit in. She’s
the very definition of post-rehab, freshly
scrubbed cool.
Once a notorious party-hearty vixen who
closed
her
share
of bars
and
flashed her breasts at David Letterman,
Barrymore even shed her clothes in a
Manhattan nightclub.
Then, of course, there were her early
struggles with drugs and alcohol that are
the stuff of Hollywood nightmares: drunk by
age nine, a coke casualty at 13 and a
recovering addict at 14. By 19, she
was married, quickly divorced and a
Playboy pinup.
Things seemed to have tumbled
completely out of control for the actress once
dubbed America’s Sweetheart following her
debut role as the wide-eyed Gertie in “E.T.

The Extra-Terrestrial.”
Still, as if to demonstrate that child stars
don’t necessarily have to end up in a drughazed coma, Barrymore has recently
emerged from her dark teen-age years as a
vibrant and approachable young woman ...
and hardly a geek.
“There’s a great lightness to her. And yet
she also has a lot of wisdom, especially for a
young girl,” Frank Coraci, director of “The
Wedding Singer,” says. “Drew is the kind of
girl every guy falls in love with.”
And now, with three new, upbeat films
and a maturity beyond her years, the gushy,
charming Barrymore is finally the kind of girl
you can bring home to mother.
“I feel as old as the Stone Age,” she says,
laughing hard. “My past is such a great part
of my life, but I like to live in the now. It’s
really just been a natural evolution. I keep
trying to find my way.”
Barrymore made her show business debut
as an 11-month-old promoter of Puppy
Choice Dog Food, landing the role of Gertie
opposite Steven Spielberg’s darling alien by
age
seven.
Two
years
later she was burning up the screen
in “Firestarter.”
But after her embarrassing and much
publicized battles with addiction, a painful
year of institutionalization and a tell-all teen­
age autobiography, “Little Girl Lost,”
directors more or less laughed when her
name came up.
“One thing that really bummed me out
big-time was that on a professional level
people thought I was incapable, or that I
would be problematic,” she says. ‘That was

Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler in “The Wedding Singer.”

so hard for me because I’m such a stickler for
professionalism. I don’t tolerate an y ... ego or
lateness. Never in my life have I had a
problem on a set.”
Barrymore was forced to take on sleazier
movie roles, as a promiscuous teen in 1992’s
“Poison Ivy” and a troubled teen
experiencing “Mad Love” in 1995. She also
starred in “Guncrazy,” “Boys on the Side”
and “Bad Girls.”
Last year she made tentative steps toward
the lost limelight by appearing in two
celebrated films, Wes Craven’s “Scream,” the
successful comic send up of horror movies,
and Woody Allen’s offbeat musical,
“Everyone Says I Love You.”
Now she stars as the girl-next-door with
Adam Sandler in the romantic comedy “The
Wedding Singer,” and will next appear with
boyfriend Luke Wilson in “Home Fries” and
as the title character opposite Anjelica Huston
in “Cinderella.”

that she can do anything that she wants,”
Allen Court, who co-stars in “The Wedding
Singer,” says. “She has a natural talent. And
she has no fear.”
“I feel great,” Barrymore says, beaming.
“I feel so unscrewed-up. The older I get, the
less uptight I get and the younger I feel. You
know, I felt so much responsibility growing
up. I was terrified because I didn’t have a
family and I was terrified that I wouldn’t have
a place to stay or food to eat, or anything.
“And you don’t think, when you’re six
years old, I can call my friend and say, ‘I need
to live in your guest house.’ If I was an adult,
I’d do that I’d reach out to somebody. But
when you’re a kid, you don’t understand
that concept.
“I was such a self-sufficient little nut,” she
continues. “I felt like I was on this hamster
wheel, thinking, ‘I’ve got to do this,’ and,
‘I’ve got to do that.’

Real “Big Lebowski” speaks out
about the Coen Brothers new flick
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The
real Jeff Lebowski wants you to
know he isn’t anything like the
pot-smoking loafer depicted in
the Coen brothers’ new movie,
“The Big Lebowski.”
“I ’m not aware of any
parallels between my life” and
the movie, said Lebowski, an
assistant attorney general in
M innesota and a former
Minneapolis prosecutor.
Lebowski, 37, went to the
same high school in the
Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis
Park as filmmakers Joel and
Ethan Coen, whose previous
movies include “Fargo,” “Blood

Simple” and “Raising Arizona.”
Joel Coen says he has no
recollection of going to school
with Lebowski, according to
Alan Schoolcraft, chief of
operations for the C oen’s
production
company.
Schoolcraft said the Coen
brothers got the name Lebowski
from a friend of their sister.
“So Mr. Attorney General is
in the clear, or we are,”
Schoolcraft said.
In “The Big Lebowski,”
actor Jeff Bridges portrays Jeff
Lebowski, also known as “The
Dude,” a shiftless bowling fan
who gets caught up in a

Now, I’m still on that hamster wheel but my
priorities have changed. It’s not because I need to
make sure I have food and shelter. It’s because I
need to make sure I don’t waste my day. I want to
do the things that I believe in.”
These days, Barrymore is a spokeswoman for
the Female Health Foundation, an organization
that educates young children about sexually
transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.
She also volunteers her time to the Wildlife
Waystation, a California animal sanctuary.
Growing up in the Hollywood fishbowl has
tempered those youthful and reckless nights of
bra-tossing, vodka-soaked revelry, she says.

kidnapping after he’s mistaken
for a millionaire also named
Jeff Lebowski.
The real Lebowski says he’s
“having a good laugh” with the
notoriety.
“I just had a judge today ask
me, ‘Are you the original
Lebowski?” ’ he said.
Lebowski will be in Jamaica
on vacation when the movie,
which also stars John Goodman,
Julianne Moore and Steve
Buscemi, premieres March 6.
Asked if he planned to
see the movie, Lebowski
replied with a M innesotan
“You betcha.”

“You have to be smart about it. You have to
think, ‘OK, I can’t do that. I don’t get to go and
have fun with people because I will be publicly
judged and depicted and criticized for that.’ And
th a t... bites,” she says.
“But when I think of that, instead of sitting
around and complaining, there are things that I get
to do in my life that are so extraordinary that I’m
willing to give up going out for a beer in order to
work in a program for the U.N. Now that’s
important.”
And, as if to cement her newfound image,
Barrymore will soon appear as Cinderella. How
bizarre is that?
“I know, it’s going to be weird,” she says,
unleashing peals of laughter. “I’m honored, are
you kidding? Cinderella? I’ll take it, OK?”

But, by no means, did I embarrass myself as did these supposed
grown-ups. (No, I do not consider myself a grown-up.)
Not convinced of the the greedy tendencies of adults? Okay, second
example. I go to quite a few free advance movie screenings for review
purposes. They are also attended by some of the general public who
win passes on radio giveaways and such. Sometimes the radio station
sends a rep to give away free crap with the movie’s logo on it: t-shirts,
hats, posters, condoms, toasters. You get the idea.
I had never seen people react this way before. I literally have
witnessed a woman, who must have been at least 50 years old, run
down the aisle screaming for a Spice Girls CD. Another time, she
scraped at the sticky movie theater floor for coasters with a picture of
David Spade on it. She was a nut. I can just imagine her home. She has
a whole room covered in movie garbage and has a story to go with
each and every item.
And, sadly, she is not a rarity. I have seen countless, supposedly
mature, adults (actually trash) scream, yell, jump and make complete
asses of themselves for a hat with a “Ernest Goes to a Leather Bar”
logo on it like they were begging for bread for their starving
children. I weep for society. Then I do a little dance called the “I’m
Not Them Boogie.”

No. 3 Cougars to face No. 6 Kentucky Wesleyan in quarterfinals
■ BY JASON TRIPLETT
SPORTS REPORTER
The bracket for the Great Lakes Valley Conference
women’s tournament is out and has SIUE ranked No. 3
with home court advantage in the first round.
The Cougar women will face Kentucky Wesleyan
College at the Vadalabene Center tonight. In the Cougar’s
first two meetings with Wesleyan the game’s were high
scoring and hard fought.
“Kentucky Wesleyan is a tough place to play,” Cougar
head coach Wendy Hedberg said, “For that and obvious
reasons we are happy to be at home in the first round.”
Hedberg and the team knew they would have home
court advantage after an easy 61-47 victory against a
struggling Quincy University team last Thursday.
Quincy’s slow offense kept the Cougars off balance.
The Hawks were below full strength with only four
players on the bench and SIUE took full advantage of the
opportunity.
“They walk the ball up the court whereas we like to get
out and run,” Hedberg said. “Throughout the game we
tried to get them to play our type of basketball.”
Misi Clark scored 19 points with Leslie Phillips and
Kim Lowe scoring both in double figures. Lowe also
grabbed 15 rebounds still pushing toward rebounding title
next year.

Quincy’s leading scorer, center Laura Sorenson, or
Swede as they call her, was held to only eight points and
four rebounds. Eileen Kerrigan and Colleen Sexton both
scored in double figures for the Hawks.
Saturday’s contest against the University of MissouriSt. Louis was a much more physical game according to
Hedberg. But the Cougars achieved their goal of a
seven game winning streak to end their season with a
79-64 victory.
“We had more trouble this weekend against UMSL,”
Hedberg said. “They would be aggressive when we cut
into the lane and we had to be more physical in the post.”
Aside from the more physical play from UMSL, four
SIUE players scored in double figures. Senior Alicia
Harkins made her last regular season game count, scoring
25 points. Harkins set the standard and scoring became
contagious as three other SIUE players scored in double
figures. All but two Cougars got on the board.
Although the two freshman guards, Erica Cory and
Clark are going to have their first experience in post
season college play, Hedberg has total confidence in her
guards and thinks they have measured up this season.
“Misi and Erica have seen some tough games this
year,” Hedberg said. “Although I admit the
upperclassmen know a little better what to expect.”

said. “I’m pleased with the focus

Iverson’s father convicted
of stabbing ex-girlfriend
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) —
The father of Philadelphia 76ers
star Allen Iverson has pleaded
guilty to stabbing his ex­
girlfriend, and was sentenced to
nine years in prison.
Allen Broughton, 38, was
convicted of first-degree assault
in the April 27, 1996, attack on
Chrystal Owens. He pleaded
under the Alford Doctrine, which
means he does not admit to the
crime but concedes there is

enough evidence to convict him.
Authorities said Broughton
attacked Owens, 32, after their
10-year relationship broke up.
Broughton has been in jail
since the assault. He also was
sentenced to five years of
probation.
Iverson, 22, spent much of his
youth in Virginia away from his
father. A team spokeswoman said
the team does not comment on
players’ families.

Seahawks sign Kevin Glover
SEATTLE (AP) — Pro Bowl
center Kevin Glover, who
anchored the line that cleared as
Barry Sanders rushed for 2,053
yards last year for the Detroit
Lions, has signed a three-year,
$8.1 million contract with the
Seattle Seahawks.

Glover, 34, was the NFC
starter in the Pro Bowl the past
three seasons. The 6-foot-2, 282pound center has played his
entire pro career for the Detroit
Lions after being chosen in the
second round of the 1985 draft.

Boggs ready to pursue 3,000 hits with Tampa Bay
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP)
— At 39, Wade Boggs can’t
remember ever reporting to
spring training in better physical
condition.
He’s ready to resume his
pursuit of 3,000 career hits, and
excited that the opportunity is
coming with the expansion
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who
signed him as a free agent in
December.
Boggs, who’s 200 hits away
from the plateau, grew up in the
area and relishes the thought of
achieving the milestone in front
of fans who began following him
in high school.
And, perhaps even more
important, he likes the idea of
doing it as an everyday player.
“Last year was the best I’ve
felt since I’ve been in the big
leagues,” the five-time AL
batting champion said. “But it’s
kind of ironic. It was the best I’ve
felt and I was on the bench.”
Boggs, who hasn’t set a
timetable
for
retirement,

career-low 103 hits while
splitting time at third base with
Charlie Hayes in 1997.
He envisions himself playing
145-150 games for the Devil
Rays this year. While the last
time he played more than 132
was 1993, Boggs is confident his
body will hold up because of a
diligent offseason conditioning
program.
“I don’t know how much
longer I’m going to play ... I’ve
always said, it’s something I’ve
done since Little League and as
long as it’s fun, you continue to
do it,” Boggs said.
“Naturally, as a professional
athlete you want to do it on a
level that you don’t embarrass
yourself. As long as you can still
perform and compete and do the
things that you’ve always done,
then you just keep playing.”
Boggs’ .331 career average is
the third best among major
leaguers who have played after
World War II behind Ted
Williams (.344) and Tony Gwynn
(.340). Along with 3,000 career

hits, Boggs is closing in on 1,000
RBIs.
“That’s a pretty good plateau
that I’m looking for,” he said,
noting he’s 67 shy and very well
could reach both in the same
season.
“But everything really fell into
place and perspective for me
when I got the World Series ring
(1996). That was the piece of the
puzzle that was missing. As far as
the 3,000 goes, it’s just a stepping
stone that I’m going to eventually
go by. It’s just going to be a
number and something in the
past. I’m not using it as a
termination point.”
The first day of full-squad
workouts Friday was not
uneventful for Boggs, who was
hit in the head by a changeup
thrown by projected No. 2 starter
Tony Saunders. Boggs was not
injured and joked that at least he
knows his batting helmet works.
“I might not have gotten back
up if it was a heater,” he said.
“That would have been a heck of
a thing.”

Pitcher Martinez getting second chance with Braves Bengals sign
KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) — At
the age of 42, Dennis Martinez is
getting another shot in the
big leagues.
Martinez, who appeared to be
out of baseball when Seattle
released him last May, is getting
what could be his last chance
with the Atlanta Braves.
The Braves are looking for
someone to fill the No. 5 starter’s
spot until right-hander John
Smoltz is available. Smoltz, the
1996 NL Cy Young winner,
underwent elbow surgery Dec. 12
and is expected to open the
season on the disabled list.
Atlanta manager Bobby Cox
has been raving about Martinez
since pitchers and catchers began

practicing Saturday.
“I haven’t seen any reduction
in stuff,” Cox said Friday after
Martinez threw batting practice
against the regulars for the
first time.
“He doesn’t have to go out
and shoot lights out in spring
training either if he keeps
throwing his stuff. It’s there right
now,” he said.
Martinez,
a
native
of
Nicaragua who will be 43 on
May 14, said he was thrilled
when the Braves invited him to
spring training at their new
Disney World complex.
“It’s like I’m dreaming,” he
said. “I feel like a young kid, a

new kid again, coming to
Disney World.”
Martinez needs two victories
to become the winningest Latin
American pitcher in major league
history, trailing only Juan
Marichal. In a 22-year career
with
Baltimore,
Montreal,
Cleveland and Seattle, Martinez
has a 241-187 record.
The four-time All-Star pitched
a perfect game for the Expos in
1991 against Los Angeles.
He agreed to a $250,000
contract with the Braves, but first
he must make the club. He could
earn another $500,000 in bonuses
if he starts 25 times.
“Honestly,
this
guy
is

throwing good, really,” Cox said.
“I don’t know if it’s going to last,
but his fast ball is there, the
breaking ball is there and so is the
location. Right now, for me, he
could go out and start a major
league game.”
Martinez underwent knee
surgery after the 1996 season and
his elbow flared up last season.
On May 24, he was released by
the Mariners after going 1-5 with
a 7.71 ERA.
“At my age I didn’t want to
get cut,” he said. “I was lucky. I
rested for a couple of months,
didn’t touch a ball, did rehab with
weights and began to strengthen
my elbow.

Copeland to
five-year
contract
CINCINNATI (AP) — The
Cincinnati Bengals have signed
John Copeland to a five-year
contract, ending Copeland’s brief
test of free agency and giving the
Bengals a surplus of high-priced
defensive ends.
The contract, believed to be
worth around $15 million, runs
through the 2002 season.
“It’s a great contract,”
Copeland said after signing
Friday. “The Bengals really
stepped up, but money alone
doesn’t totally buy happiness.
You have to know when you look
in the mirror that you did the right
thing and I know I made this
decision for the right reasons.
This is a team that can be in the
playoffs soon, hopefully this year.
We’ve got the talent.”
Copeland, 27, was the
Bengals’ first-round draft pick in
1993 and has been a mainstay.
But when the Bengals used their
“franchise player” designation
last week on defensive end Dan
Wilkinson, Copeland said he
would see what opportunities he
could find elsewhere.
Last season, the Bengals
switched to a three-man line as
part of Dick LeBeau’s blitz-zone
defense, and Copeland led the
defensive linemen with 49 tackles
(35 solo), had three sacks and
recovered two fumbles.
“John is a fierce competitor on
the field, and in five years we’ve
grown to know and respect him
as a person and a player,” said
Bengals general manager Mike
Brown.
Copeland’s
agent,
Tim
McGee, said he spent most of
Friday with three Bengals
negotiators and a deal was struck
when Brown got involved.
“It came down to Mike Brown
walking into the room and getting
it done,” McGee told the Dayton
Daily News. “Mike interceded,
took over and we got it done.”
A source said the contract
included a $4 million signing
bonus and averaged $2.9 million
a year.
The Bengals also have signed
defensive end Michael Bankston
to a reported three-year, $6
million contract, pending a
decision by Arizona on whether
to exercise its right to match the
offer.
With Copeland under contract,
and Arizona not expected to
match the Bengals’ offer to
Bankston, Cincinnati might be
willing to trade Wilkinson to
Washington, where he wants to
go“This gives us options we
would not have had if we couldn’t
get John signed,” Brown told The
Cincinnati Enquirer. “How that
plays out remains to be seen.”

NFL’s top kickoff returner to return to Panthers
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) —
Carolina’s Michael Bates, who
led the NFL in kickoff returns in
the NFL in each of the last two
seasons, agreed to a new contract
with the Panthers.
The Panthers would not
disclose terms of the deal. Bates’
agent, Jim Steiner, did not
immediately return telephone
messages left at his office.
Bates, winner of a bronze

medal in the 200 meters at the
Barcelona Olympics, will be
playing in his sixth NFL season.
He was voted to the Pro Bowl
after the 1996 season, when he
averaged 30.2 yards per return,
the best figure in the league since
1977. One kickoff was returned
93 yards for a touchdown.
Bates also was named to the
Pro Bowl after the 1997 season,
when he averaged 27.3 yards per

return, including a long of 56
yards. He became the first player
to lead the league in kickoff
returns in consecutive years
since Abe Woodson in 1962
and 1963.
Bates, who joined the Panthers
in 1996 as a free agent, also is a
member of Carolina’s punt
coverage teams. He blocked two
punts in 1996.

Tigers’ manager Dolphins sign lineman Matt
Bell mulling

LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) —
Detroit Tigers manager Buddy
Bell is contemplating several
different batting orders as his
ballclub continues spring training
workouts in preparation for
Friday’s exhibition opener vs. the
New York Yankees.
Bell is certain that center
fielder Brian Hunter will hit
leadoff,
newly
acquired
utilityman Bip Roberts second
and slugging first baseman Tony
Clark fourth.
“Beyond that, I don’t know,”
Bell said. “We have a lot of guys
who can hit in a lot of different
spots. We have interchangeable
parts. You don’t necessarily have
to have somebody who is going
to hit 40 home runs hitting behind
Tony Clark.
“Bobby Higginson could hit
there, Luis Gonzalez could hit
there, Joe Oliver could possibly
hit there, Damion Easley could
hit there. We’ve got some guys
who can hit just about anywhere
in the order,” he said.
Most of Detroit’s positions are
set.
Clark will be at first base,
Easley at second base, Billy
Ripken at shortstop until Deivi
Cruz returns from a fractured
ankle, Joe Randa at third base,
Higginson in right field. Hunter
in center field and Gonzalez in
left field.
Catching is the only job open
with Oliver competing against
holdover Raul Casanova. It’s a far
cry from his first two spring
trainings as Detroit’s manager for
Bell, who inherited a very
unsettled situation. The Tigers
went from a 53-109 record in
1996 to a 79-83 mark in 1997.
My job is getting easier,” Bell
said. “It’s nice to be able to sit
back and watch how they go
about their business and play the
game rather than looking for
eight pitchers for your staff and
four or five players for your
lineup.”
Because Cruz’s injury has
limited the number of middle
infielders in camp, former San
Diego Padre and San Francisco
Giant Paul Faries was added to
the major league camp as a non­
roster invitee Saturday

not expected to match, which
means Campbell will join guard
Kevin Donnalley as newcomers
on the line.

Marijuana charges dropped
against Packers’ Jervey
MOUNT p l e a s a n t , S.C.
(AP) — Police have dropped a
marijuana-possession
charge
against Green Bay Packers
running back Travis Jervey,
saying tests show the drug was
not among evidence found in
his car.
The active ingredient in
marijuana was not present among
ashes and pieces of rolling paper
taken from an ashtray, police
Chief Roddy Perry said Friday.
“In the absence of laboratory
evidence, we will not be moving
forward,” he said.
Jervey, 25, was arrested
Tuesday night after a routine

traffic stop. The Isle of Palms
native was pulled for driving 46
miles an hour in a 35-mph zone, a
police report said.
An officer noticed a strong
odor he suspected was marijuana
coming from the car. Jervey twice
denied having drugs, though a
search turned up the ashes and
rolling papers. He was released
on bond.
A March 10 court date was set
on the speeding charge.
Jervey, a fifth-round draft
choice out of The Citadel
in 1995, was a Pro Bowl
selection this year as a specialteams player.

VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) —
When Tom Candiotti left for the
Oakland A’s and Todd Worrell
retired in the offseason, the Los
Angeles Dodgers pitching staff
lost 26 years of experience.
But instead of acquiring
veterans during the off-season,
the Dodgers opted to fill their
experience needs with pitchers
already in the organization.
Darren Dreifort, who has
never started a game in the
majors, is battling 20-year-old
Dennis Reyes for the fifth-starter
role. Dreifort has 115 innings of
major league experience as a
reliever. Reyes only has 47
innings of big-league experience
but did start five games for the
Dodgers last year.

If the Dodgers happen to lose
one of their key pitchers to
injury this season, manager Bill
Russell said 22-year-old Mike
Judd, who pitched in just one bigleague game last year, will be
called upon.
“H e’s probably our next
pitcher to come up if something
happens,” Russell said. “He
can come fast, he’s got
outstanding stuff.”
First-year pitching coach
Goose Gregson said he’s
comfortable with the pitchers he
has to work with.
“We may not have as much
experience as last year, but I
don’t think we’ll be lacking in
quality,” he said.
