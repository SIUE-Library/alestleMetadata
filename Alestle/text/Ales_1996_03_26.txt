Effective as of July 1, Sean Pohl, a student m ajoring in
business adm inistration, will take over the student trustee
position, acting as a liaison between the student body and the
board of trustees.
Pohl was elected by m em bers of the student body in a oneman race last Wednesday.
“I am excited to have such a position,” Pohl said. “ It was
exciting to see so much participation by the students, regardless
of who got what position.”
Pohl has served as a leader since the beginning of his
collegiate career as a m em ber of the Student Leadership
Developm ent Program (SLDP) as well as a m em ber of the
^University C enter B oard (UCB).
“SLD P gave me a lot of skills that will aid me in my
leadership. Through the program 1 met a lot of people from
other organizations, and it also led me to joining UCB,” Pohl
said.
Pohl currently serves as the chairperson for UCB's C urrent
Affairs com m ittee, and feels that the broad knowledge that he
has gained from his work in UCB and the SLDP will aid him in
his position.
Pohl defines his new position as student trustee as the voice
of the student body, acting in part to express this voice to the
board of trustees.

National-----------------------------------------------------No clemency for spy for Israelis
• White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said Sunday that President Bill
Clinton had no plans to grant clemency to Jonathan Pollard, convicted a decade
ago of spying for Israel. Panetta said on CNN’s “Late Edition” program that “our
position on Pollard had not changed.” He said that an Israeli official’s visit to
Pollard in prison scheduled for this week was arranged through prison officials,
not the White House. In January, Israel make Pollard a citizen in hopes of winning
his release from prison but to no avail. Pollard was convicted of turning over
military secrets to Israeli agents.

International_______________________________
Sinn Fein commits to vote on talks
• Irish Republican Army supporters authorized their leaders Sunday to take
part in an election that will precede negotiations on Northern Ireland’s political
future. Unanimously, but with an obvious lack of enthusiasm for the Britishproposed election, about 350 delegates at the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party’s annual
conference in Dublin told party leaders to “take necessary steps to ensure the
voice of our electorate is not isolated.” Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, now
plans to consult with one of Northern Ireland’s most respected Catholic
politicians, John Hume, about whether to participate in the election May 30.

letter to the editor

Abdul-Rauf could’ve played somewhere else and been happy
I am responding to your editorial in the M arch
21st issue of the Alestle. I was not able to read E llet’s
article so I can only respond to your statem ents. In
your defense of Abdul-Rauf, you state that “after he
accepted Allah as his God, he learned that there are
more precious things in this life and that money is
not everything.” You went on to explain that he
contemplated retiring from the NBA. Your next
statem ent was a bit illogical, however.
“D o you think many other Am ericans would give
up all that m oney for their belief in G od?” Since
A bdul-R auf had merely contemplated retiring, he in
fact had not given up anything. W here is the great
sacrifice for his beliefs th at you im ply o ther
Americans aren ’t willing to m ake? A n individual
who tells others (in this case, the m edia) of their
intended plans and then does not follow through
with those plans quickly loses credibility. It appears
to the intelligent observer that A bdul-R auf wanted
people to know what a huge price he was willing to
pay for his beliefs and yet he really did not intend to
pay that price.

letter to the editor---------------------------------

‘Best of’ category
insult to humanity
Let me establish from the outset that I am writing as
a m em ber of the hum an family—not essentially from
the perspective of my role as a campus minister.
In brief, I am disappointed in one of the categories in
the “ Best of S IU E ” survey. U n d er “ G oods and
Services,” the ballot lists “ Best Place To G et D runk.”
This category insults humanity. It is misguided and
inappropriate. I urge you to delete it from the ballot in
your M arch 26 issue.

Director, Catholic Campus Ministry at SIUE

letter to the editor_______________________

Alestle doing a good job
This letter is being w ritten to congratulate what has
been an effective, positive, imaginative and absolutely
entertaining Alestle staff for the great work that they
have done the past year.
N ever before (since I ’ve been in school—and,
believe me, th at’s been a long time!) has the new spaper
been so entertaining. The changes (Yes, we do notice
them!) have definitely m eant variety. M arket studies
asked students what they w anted in their newspaper;
there were Sportsm en and Sportswom en of the m onth,
there were big, bright and inform ative supplements.
Much to your credit, there was even one w eekend the
“A lestle” won over the “R iverfront Tim es” in helping a
very bored group of students decide where to go.
There is one thing though; that hideous comics
section has to be re-thought.
This is for an outstanding team that definitely works
well together. G ood job Terry, Roy, and “A lestle” staff.
Thomas Kwasa
Alestle Watcher

In the next paragraph you criticize the NBA for
not stopping A bdul-R auf’s actions p rior to the
intense media coverage. You argue that he did not do
som ething which was stipulated in his contract,
“stand and line up in a dignified posture,” and that
just because som ething is required by contract
doesn’t m ake it right. If you live by the belief that a
business contract can be broken based upon
personal or religious beliefs, then I can only assume
you would not enter into a contract that you found
personally offensive. If som ething had changed your
views drastically (accepting Allah as your G od), then
I can also assume that you would do everything in
your power to re-negotiate a business contract that
you had previously en tered in. If you w ere
unsuccessful with your re-negotiation and you truly
had changed, your only option would be to uphold
your beliefs and term inate the business contract.
The decision by A bdul-R auf to return to the
term s of his contract points to a shallowness in his
beliefs. If he truly believed that what he was doing
(protesting against honoring the National A nthem

and the country it represents, the U nited States of
Am erica), he would not have given in and would
have eith er re-negotiated his contract with the
Nuggets to allow him not to stand, or he would no
longer be playing professional basketball in this
country.
Finally, in response to your com m ents in the last
paragraph of your editorial, “it w asn’t just the money
the NBA took away from him, it was his chance to do
som ething he loved—play basketball.”
If A bdul-R auf w asn’t really interested in the
money and was acting out of principle, he could go
play ball in any country he found acceptable to his
beliefs. I'm sure h e’d be a star w herever he chose to
go but he w ouldn’t get paid the kind of m oney he
m akes in the NBA.

commentary______________________________________________________________

The winds are a changin’ at the Alestle
W hen Roy called Darryl Howlett and I into his office two weeks ago to ask us if we were
considering applying for the Editor-In-Chief position I laughed. I told myself there was no way I was
ever going to apply for that kind of self-hatred. I like my life too much to give it up for a year,
working as E ditor In-Chief for the Alestle.
But as I thought about it more and more, I decided, maybe, just
maybe, it would be an okay job. So, I gathered up all of my courage
and said, “what the hey, I’ll give it a whirl.”
Now today is D-day, and I am going for a group interview for the
position. I must adm it, I am a little nervous. Not about the questions,
or the line of eyes staring hard at me while 1 mum ble through the
answers, but because of all of the other what-ifs.
W hat if I don’t get it? W hat if Darryl gets it? W hat if Darryl
doesn’t get it, and som eone who is from the “outside” of the paper
does? W hat if I do get it, and I do an awful job? (Scratch that, now is
not the time for self-doubt.)
W hat if everything does go well, then what would I do when my
year is up? W hat if I hate it? W hat if the staff hates me? W hat if the person who gets the job is a real
poop-head? W hat if he/she’s great but the rest of the staff is unbearable to work with? W hat if
Gretzky breaks his ankle and can never play hockey again? Will the news interrupt Friends again?
W hat if? W hat if? W hat if?!!
If I do get the job, I would have to think about the things I would change around here. If I were
Roy for a day, the first thing I would do is clean this office. (Roy, I know you are trying to prove a
point, but the three m onth old tray of Chinese food has got to go. Yuck!)
The next thing would definitely be the Comics page. Hello! I love the fact that they are all student
cartoonists and all, but we need some fresh stuff, like a horoscope, or a crossword. M aybe even a few
syndicated cartoons, the possibilities are endless.
Ideas are swarming through my head like bees. I could change the lay out of the paper, or add a
G reek page or ... anything, or maybe nothing. Nothing can be for certain right now.
T here is one thing for certain, however, the winds, they’re a changin’. No m atter who fills the
position, the Alestle will not be the same paper as it was this year.
Eli w on’t be on Sports, Roy won’t be cracking me up about anything and everything one can think
of to talk about and Terry won’t be walking around in his socks... just kidding, some things never
change.
This year has been a great year and next year with any luck will be even better. Because, like I
said, the winds are a-changin’ and with the help of a few A lestle staff people, I will too.

friends over breaks and during the summer. A fter a short video presentation
illustrating the daily interactions of students in the Residence Hall, the pair
closed the topic by rem inding students that if you have friends at school
w hen you leave for breaks, they will still be your friends when you come
back.
Phillips then presented a short skit about a job interview along with Chris
Smejkul. Smejkul played the part of an unprepared job seeker interview ed
by Phillips. Lucido used the skit to illustrate the D o ’s and D o n ’ts for job
interview s by stopping the interview to point out mistakes.
The presentation also suggested possible sources of sum m er em ploym ent
for students. Possibilities discussed included R iverport, Six Flags, retail
businesses, and fast food establishm ents.
The final topic of the evening was Stress M anagem ent. In a skit by Dan
G reely and D iane Hayes, G reeley played the part of a student attem pting to
deal with pressures from classes, parents, and an unm otivated friend, Hayes.
A fter the skit, G reeley em phasized that stress m anagem ent can be central
to college success. Since all students face different types of stress, each
student m ust devise his or h er own plan for coping.
“You’ve got to do what w orks for you,” said Greeley.
A fter the p resentation, students w ere given their choice of prizes from
CDs provided by E lectra Records. Amy Beth Phillips, who works for
E lectra, was responsible for providing the prizes. All of the group m em bers
chipped in to provide pizza and soft drinks for the m eeting.

Emory University scientists say no creationism
A TLA N TA (A P )—Fifty Em ory University scientists have signed a letter
urging the state school superintendent not to allow creationism to be taught in
G eorgia science classes alongside theories such as evolution.
The letter, sent to Superintendent Linda Schrenko, says “the theory of
evolution is the central unifying idea of all of biology ... Creationism is not an
alternative scientific theory; it is a set of nonscientific ideas.”
The letter was sent after Schrenko asked state A ttorney G eneral Michael
Bowers for his opinion on w hether public schools could teach the biblical version
of creation.
Bowers responded that teaching creationism could be done, but it would be
“fraught with constitutional pitfalls” because it would have to be taught in with
a secular purpose.
Schrenko would let local school boards decide w hether “they wanted to cover
(creationism ), or if they w anted to go with just evolution, or wanted to go with

(both theories), as long as it’s within the letter of the law,” said Jeff Chandler, a
spokesm an for the superintendent.
M arc Lipsitch, a microbiology researcher who w rote the Em ory letter, said
some professors w anted to m ake a stronger statem ent with the letter and
denounced creationism as “third-rate science” that could dam age A tlan ta’s
aspirations to be a truly international city.
But University of Georgia scientist David F. Jackson said he believes
evolution should be taught with m ore sensitivity to local religious beliefs.
“Science teachers should not, of course, pretend that they have no differences
of opinion with their Christian students, but they should cultivate a vision of a
classroom that is an em otionally less traum atic place to be,” Jackson wrote in the
Journal of Research in Science Teaching. Last week, his article was nam ed the
journal’s “most significant” of 1995.

H arsh w eather conditions played a
dom inant force in the SIU E softball G reat
Lakes Valley Conference games this past
w eekend at the Collinsville Sports
Complex. Only six of the scheduled 16
GLVC cluster gam es w ere played on
Saturday.
The Cougars were down 4-2 in a game
against N orthern K entucky th at was
stopped because of rain. Since the game
w ent five innings, the contest was
recorded as a loss for SIUE.
S unday’s slate
of gam es
was
u n in terru p ted by the w eather. The
Cougars started the day off with a victory
over Kentucky W esleyan 6-3. M ichele
Sucich ham m ered two hom e runs and
Jennifer Smith hit one out.
D eanna Smith was the winning pitcher,
but h er catcher, A ll-A m erican Kim
Darrow, was cut over the eye and received
stitches. This put D arrow out of action for
the rest of the weekend.
“Kim should be ready to go by this
w eekend,” said head coach Sandy
M ontgom ery about the injury to Darrow.
The Cougars continued their winning
ways later in the day with a come-frombehind victory over Lewis. Down 2-0 in
the first inning, SIU E rallied for a 5-3
triumph.

K entucky Wesleyan took all they could
handle from the Cougars in their final
game of the weekend. SIU E pounded
them 11-3 with help from Jennifer Smith,
who went 3 for 4 with 3 RBI and a home
run. Christy Perry also contributed from
the plate, going 2 for 4.
“ W e’re hitting really well,” said
M ontgom ery over the phone on Monday.
“We need to improve on our defense and
m ake sure that we work on getting our
intensity level up.”
O ver the weekend Wisconsin-Parkside
came away with an unblem ished record of
three victories and no losses. SIU E, along
with S outhern Indiana, finished the
w eather-strickened weekend 3-1.
Q uincy ended the w eekend at 2-1
followed by Kentucky Wesleyan at 2-2.
The 13-6 Cougars are led by Jennifer
Smith who is batting .439 with 5 home
runs and 15 RBI. She is followed by
Sucich who is batting .362 and also has 5
hom e runs with 15 RBI.
S IU E ’s pitching staff has a combined
E R A of 1.65. Stephanie Stinson is 3-0 with
a 1.00 E R A and D eanna Smith is 5-1 with
a 1.50.
The Cougars will take on Missouri-St.
L ouis today at hom e barring any
