‘Students have been treated fairly’
Black answers questions about OIT/ senate continues task force
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
A t the bi-weekly student senate m eeting
Friday, senators finally had the opportunity
to question Kim Black, director of the
telecom m unications task force. Black had
missed the previous two m eetings due to
schedule conflicts.
Black had been tasked with investigating
the changes in the calling circle initiated by
O IT (Office of Inform ation Technology)
this fall. W hen O IT m ade the local calling
area switch this summer, m any students
who live in B elleville, E ast St. Louis,
Fairview Heights, etc. w here unable to call
parents, family and friends.
Black first apologized to the student
governm ent body for missing the previous
meetings. She added that there were no
further changes m ade to the w ritten report
she had subm itted two weeks ago.
Several senators asked for her personal
opinion on the O IT issue.

“N othing will happen. I gathered the
inform ation to see if students were being
treated fairly. We (task force) accomplished
that,” Black said.
Senator Stephens w ondered if students
were in fact being treated fairly by the
changes prom pted by OIT.
Black said she believed they were.
“The students are being treated fairly.
The surrounding ranges we have are free.
With the cost from other calling areas that
the university was paying, it was only fair to
reduce the calling area,” Black said.
Senator C harm anyne W hite disagreed
with the findings.
“B ut the majority of the students on
cam pus are dissatisfied with the changes to
the calling area and other things by OIT,”
W hite said.
“ If the students are dissatisfied, I’m
sorry. Students can get a copy of my written
report if they like,” Black said.

Goshen Lounge: Better

By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
In an attem pt to m ake m ore students aware of and
knowledgeable about the politics on campus, the first few
senate m eetings of this fall sem ester have taken place in the
G oshen Lounge.
A lthough attendance by students has been slim, Student
Body President C hristopher Nance said the m eetings in the
lounge will continue.
“O ur m eetings will take place in the G oshen Lounge for
the rest o f the year — m ost definitely for the rest of the
sem ester,” Nance said.
In past years, meetings were held in room s located in the
University C enter on the second floor. T hough students were
invited to the meetings, m ost decided to stay away.

Did you read the yellow note that came with your check
last Thursday? Did you think you w ere getting a dollar raise?
C onfused? You’ll get m ore m oney starting with your check
O ctober 17 but probably not as much as you thought.
A ccording to M arian Sm ithson, d irec to r o f stu d en t
financial aid, when the new federal m inim um wage rates go
into effect, the university has the option of raising only those
students’ wages to $4.75 that were at $4.25. U nder that
scenario, anyone over $4.75 will not get a raise.
Instead, Smithson said, the university is giving everyone a
50 cent increase beginning O ctober 1 and a 40 cent raise
Septem ber 1, 1997. So, if a student is earning $5.00 an hour
this fall, he or she will now get $5.50.
As of O ctober 1, the bulk of the 1,515 student w orkers —
690 of them — will get $4.75. The one w orker in the $8.01$8.50 will fall into the $8.51-$9.00 range.
The increases are in addition to the dime increm ents
students get for every 500 hours they work for the university.

Paying for committing crime takes on new meaning

M ADISON COUNTY — Madison County sheriff’s
officials want to start collecting fees from inmates for

number of inmates who could afford to pay is so small
that officials have basically ignored the system. “There

Sheriff Bob Churchich said.

Letter to the editor---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Administration not in touch with the student body
‘Ted Sanders and Nancy Belck are politicians with their hands out’
This letter is in response to the cover story
“University gets tough on students,” appearing in
the Sept. 17 edition. T here seem to be a few
contradictory item s that I would like to address.
First of all, there is no “real” story contained here
u n d er this headline. T he university has done
absolutely nothing substantial to prosecute the guilty
parties responsible for the phone bill scandal. Nancy
Belck is riding the fence on the issue in hopes that
m ore students will just roll over and turn themselves
in for a crime that the police m ust have no evidence
to prosecute. H ere she is quoted as saying, “We will
not w aiver from p ro se cu tio n ,” and, “ I cannot
guarantee the same set of conditions,” referring to
students who fold now. Well, which is it? She is
taking two separate positions here. N othing new for
this m oney thirsty, inept University. Sure, SIU E
boasts the lowest tuition in the state, but you get
what you pay for. I will expound on this later.
Last year the A lestle reported that police would
be using state of the art equipm ent to gain evidence
against the perpetrators. Well, we are all waiting for
som e charges to be filed. Instead, we get
contradictory inform ation from the SIU E police and
Edwardsville police. In your article, Charles Me
D onald of the SIU E PD says, “We now feel we have
enough inform ation to question students,” while

Scott Evers of EPD says, “I’ve interviewed 30 to 40
people.” This is just an absolute joke. If I were a
career criminal, I would definitely retire in this
community. I believe there is no evidence available
outside of confessions and hear-say testim ony of
guilty students. D o you really believe that this
institution would pass on the opportunity to collect
money?
I will now expound on the money and ineptness
issue. If you w eren’t aware, the ticket writers chalk
tires in the m etered lots so they can give $15 tickets,
vice $10 tickets for an expired meter.
C onsider that you m ust also PAY your ticket
P R IO R to A P P E A L IN G a bogus charge. C onsider
how many of you have had to take an A D writing
course in conjunction with Critical Thinking, or
another course requiring a paper that meets Eng.
101 criteria for style and grammar. This is com pletely
contradictory, and a scam to get m ore money.
I was told during my first two advising sessions
that my high school transcript lacked the required
sem ester hours of biology. Luckily, G eorge Woods
noticed the discrepancy and the records office finally
adm itted their mistake, only after I was five weeks
into Bio 111 and was unable to drop/add and get my
m oney back or a class I needed.
W hen I was enrolled in Eng. 101 for this fall
semester, the advisem ent office and enrollm ent

office both signed my class list. A bout a week later I
received a phone call from a student working in the
enrollm ent office who told me th at they w ere
disenrolling me from the class because it was for
freshm an only, and that I should com e in and pick up
a closed class card from them to take to an instructor
on the first day of class. A fter driving in from
O ’fallon, I was told by another student w orker that
only the instructors give closed class cards. O n the
first day of class this fall, the instructor I petitioned
declined my request. So I returned to the initial
point of error, the academ ic advisem ent office,
where Jackie Brown inform ed me that Iw o u ld have
to do all the leg work to fix the m istake of his office.
No accountability was taken by the university to fix
its mistake.
M ark my words, you must take w hatever this
university gives you, good or bad, because the
adm inistration is not in touch with the student body.
Ted Sanders and Nancy Belck are politicians with
their hands out and they aren ’t giving anything back
but fancy lipservice. The university is tough on
stu d en ts all right; tough on th eir w allets and
academ ic careers.

New masters’ programs in Sociology, Social Work
By Kristen Thompson
News Reporter
SIU E will soon have separate departm ents
for m aster’s program s in Sociology and Social
Work.
T h e B o ard o f T rustees approved the
reo rg an izatio n o f the d ep a rtm en ts at its
Septem ber 12 meeting.
Effective in spring 1997, the division will
enable graduates of the new M aster of Social
W ork (M SW ) program to be licensed as social
workers in this state.
Separate adm inistrative offices are required
in accordance w ith the stan d ard s o f the
Council of Social W ork Education.
W ithout the change, the MSW program
would not be accredited.

The R ules and Procedures Council, Faculty
Senate, C urriculum C om m ittee of the College
of A rts and Sciences and D ean Sharon Hahs
accepted the departm ent’s proposal.
Jim Trent is acting director of the MSW
program .
H e said, “The m ajor benefit of the M aster’s
of Social W ork program is thirty m ore
graduate students.”
Trent also explained the difference between
the M aster’s in Sociology and the MSW
degrees.
“The M aster’s of Sociology is a disciplinary
degree which involves studying the nature of
society.
The MSW is a professional degree involved
in educating, as well as m aking a change in
society,” Trent said.

“T he com m ittee was there to investigate
and she did her jo b ,” W atson said.
W hen asked if there was any chance for a
change in the calling circle Black said, “We
will never have that calling circle again.”
Black also said she is very pleased with the
work of O IT D irector Cheryl Strackeljahn.
“She was very cooperative with the task
force,” Black said.
W hen it was suggested that the task force
be disb an d ed , S tu d en t Body P resident

initiated.
Student senators voted unanim ously not to'
disband the task force, but to continue the
ongoing investigation of OIT. Issues that will
continue to be addressed include the way
O IT inform s students of changes, students’
com plaints and ways in which to provide
b etter services for students.
In o th er transactions Friday, the senate
voted to table recom m endations to be m ade
to the academ ic calender until next student
senate meeting.
A m ong som e of the changes indicated are:

8 a.m. classes, spring breaks to coincide with
o ther universities’, and dropping fall break in
O ctober, adding instead tw o days to
Thanksgiving break, giving students an entire
week off.
Nance rem inded student governm ent of
the 12 percent increase in the freshm an class
and said, “The 8 o'clock tim e would be like
every o ther university. It would (m ake better)
use of the class space — m ore room for
students.”
Student senator H eather R ulo was voted
out of student governm ent because of too
m any unexcused absences. N ance will
recom m end a candidate for the vacant
position at the next meeting.
S en ato r S tephens also inform ed the
student body that repairs on lots and roads in
Tower Lake start next summer. R epairs will
begin with Tower Lake parking lots and then
roads in and around Tower Lake.

Lounge. Students have the opportunity to voice their
concerns right there,” Little said.
Before student governm ent decided to have its meetings
in the lounge, it also tried several other spots, including the
Residence Hall and Tower Lake A partm ents.
Nance believes the message is getting out to students.
“Just today, we had 21 students trained for committees.
I would like to see m ore student participation. T here are a
lot m ore concerns out there than what students are
voicing,” Nance said.
O ne senator, Bill A nderson, noted at Friday’s meeting
that some students on campus were displeased with student
governm ent because of their lack of issues concerning
students who live off campus.
O ne stu den t who agrees with the feeling of no
com m itm ent to o ther students is Ethil Bouldin,25, a junior
m ajoring in history from Wood River, II.
“A lot of students don’t come to school on Friday’s and
the 2:30 time is when a lot of students are ready to go
home. Also, you have to consider that the university has a
lot of non-traditional students who have families,” Bouldin
said.
Along with meetings in the G oshen Lounge, student
governm ent also runs a weekly article in the Alestle to
keep students inform ed about issues on campus and
decisions m ade at governm ent meetings.

Keanu Reeves is a hit in 'Feeling Minnesota'
By Corey Stulce
For the Alestle
Movie review
“Feeling Minnesota”
H ere is a little known fact for the kids: Keanu
Reeves can act if he really wants.
P erhaps it tak es a quality film like “Feeling
M innesota” for him to achieve actual acting
capabilities. If so, he should stick with w riter/director
Steven Baigelman, who put together a dark, funny,
quirky film about two brothers who can’t get along.
The story goes like this: R eeves plays Jjaks who
returns to his hom etow n for his brother Sam ’s
(Vincent D ’Onofrio) w edding. Sam is- the
accountant for R ed (Delroy Lindo), the local crime
lord, and he is m arrying Freddie (Cameron Diaz),
against her will. Freddie is a gift for Sam, from Red,
who claims that he owns Freddie for some odd
reason. Jjaks has been in and out of jail for years, and
it is hard for him to break free from crime. H e
always has B en (Dan Aykroyd), the local
investigator, on his keister.
Jjaks and F reddie have sex at the w edding
reception, and then Sam ’s m other keels over dead.
A fter the funeral, Jjaks and Freddie run away
together, with Sam following. Sam kills Freddie, but
he covers it up to give the illusion that Jjaks did it.
From then on, th ere are num erous fist fights
between the two brothers. Confused? Good. It all
works out in the end.
Baigelman m ust have realized that such a strange,
convoluted story would not have w orked w ithout the

the audience, even after killing his wife, cheating and
then killing his boss, and then fram ing his bro th er for
m urder.
Sam is a dum b man, and he loves to let his fists do
the talking, but he still has some sort of charming,
sym pathetic quality sim ilar to that of Lenny from
“O f Mice and M en.”
Reeves and Diaz chew through the scenery nicely,
w ithout trying to shine, which gives room for the rest
of the ensem ble to get noticed. Lindo has played a
crime lord before, but again he does a fine job.
The best o f the sm aller p erform ances go to
Aykroyd as a dirty cop and to Courtney Love, of the
band Hole, as a waitress. A ykroyd is slick and sleazy
in this role, and he also gets his head pushed through
a headlight, which is quite hum orous. Love spends
her three scenes waiting on D ’O nofrio, who is
usually covered in a bloody shirt. She plays off him
nicely, and surprisingly she d oesn't look strung out
on heroin.
The film has a great script, but it does sometimes
get a little too violent. It’s fine to be dark, and there
are five or six fights betw een Reeves and D ’Onofrio,
© 1995 Fine Line Features/All rights reserved all played for comedy, but the scene in which Reeves
Freddie (Cameron Diaz) and Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) in gets his ear bitten off is quite amusing.. Baigelman

gives the film a very hazy, alm ost grainy look. Even
when the sun is shining it’s hard to tell, and this helps
right cast; so each part, even the small ones, were the film’s dreamy, dazed feel.
chosen very carefully. The most impressive casting
O th er than the violence, this film doesn’t have any
choice is D ’O nofrio, who usually plays small
weak areas. Even if it is an attem pt to cash in on the
character roles. His best known part to date was the
popularity of such quirky tales like “Pulp Fiction,” it
hom icidal P rivate Pyle in “Full M etal Jacket.”
D ’O nofrio is som ehow able to get compassion from is a successful effort from all involved— B+

CD reviews
“Like Cats and Dogs”
Catherine Wheel
The band Catherine Wheel is a
group that has been around for a
while, with a soft and rath er mellow
sound to its music.
Following
the
road
of
nonconform ity, the group shows
depth and contem plation in their
music.
With the release of their fourth
album, “Like Cats and Dogs,” the
group displays th eir brooding
intensity such as in “H eal 2” and
“Tongue Twisted.”
Catherine Wheel form ed in 1990
in the town of G reat Yarm outh,
England. The m em bers of the band
are R ob Dickinson, Brian Futter,
Dave Hawes and Neil Sims. The
band nam ed itself after a torture
device that dates back to the fourth
century.
It’s easy to see why they nam ed
themselves after a torture device.
Their music should be used as one.
A fter about a m inute of listening to
nothing but music and no lyrics, it’ll
start to annoy you.

Overall, it’s the music for people
who have the tim e and the patience
to sit and p onder the m eaning of
their songs. But, basically, it just
plain sucks.
“XTORT”
KMFDM
In the past, the band KMFDM has
provided listeners with a steady
stream
of
generic,
though
som ewhat likable, music.
Not anymore. In their new album,
“X tort,” the band follows a
different beat. T he addictive music
and poetic lyrics will suck you in.
Sometim es com pared to the band
Nine Inch Nails, songs like “Power”
and “ In a n e ” display the b an d ’s
unique and refreshing talent.
The CD features Chris Connelly,
Bill R ieflin o f M inistry and
Revolting Cocks, F.M. Einheit of
Einsturzende N eubauten, as well as
spoken
w ord
artist
Nicole
Blackman. The band is also on the
“ M ortal
K o m b at”
movie
soundtrack.
I don’t recom m end this if you
listen to K enny G o r B arry
Manilow. B ut if you like good
alternative music, then this is the
CD for you.

Cougars split two GLVC matches over weekend
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The S IU E w om en’s tennis team split their two
G reat Lakes Valley C onference m atches this w eek­
end in Rom eoville, 111.
R ain forced Friday afternoon’s m atch against
Lewis University indoors, but this didn’t bother the
Cougars who polished off Lewis 5-0.
A t num ber one singles, Sarah H ardim on blanked
her opponent 6-0, 6-0 and Christy Ulavege pulled
out a 6-3,7-6 (10-8) victory at two singles.
“I ’m pleased with the strength in S arah’s game,”
said head coach Bill Logan. “She seems to be

putting things together as the top player on the
team .”
“Christy showed a lot of m ental toughness in her
m atch,” Logan said. “She’s a newcom er to the col­
lege game, but she’s holding her own out there.”
Victorious doubles team s were H ardim on and
Ulavege 8-1, A nn C olter and Julie K lueter 8-0, and
Sonya W ohltman and Erica Conway 8-4.
“All of the doubles team s played well together,”
Logan said.
The Cougars w eren’t as successful in S aturday’s
m atch with St. Joseph’s College. They lost 7-2 to one
of the toughest schools in the GLVC.
Sarah H ardim on produced one of the only bright

spots of the match with another 6-0,6-0 win at num ­
ber one singles.
H ardim on team ed up with Ulavege to tally the
only doubles victory for SIU E, 8-3.
“We played some close m atches th at just didn’t
go our way,” Logan said. “St. Joe’s is a tough team .”
The Cougars travel to Indianapolis, Ind. to play
three GLVC games this weekend.
SIU E will face Indianapolis on Friday, N orthern
Kentucky on Saturday, and IU PU -Ft. Wayne on
Sunday.
“We have some big m atches coming up in the
conference, especially Indianapolis,” Logan said.
“We need to rise to the occasion and give some of
these top team s a challenge.”

SIUE athletics form
new organization to
promote participation

By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor

A new organization is looking to make some noise in
S outhern Illinois University at Edwardsville athletics.
The Cougars A thletic B ooster Association, CABA, was
established and is designed to prom ote student participa­
tion and enthusiasm for SIU E athletics. Creating an atm os­
phere of excitem ent th at has no equal at the NCAA
Division II level, the goal of CA B A is to solidify the hom e
field advantage for the Cougars with strong student support.
CA B A President Eli Savoie said students need to be
involved and show their school spirit.
“W ith the move to the G reat Lakes Valley Conference,
SIU E continues to achieve m ore in athletics every year, but
there is som ething missing,” Savoie said. “The bottom line is
we need to reduce student apathy tow ard athletics, and
CA B A is a great place to start.”
T here is no fee to become a m em ber. Once a student has
m em bership he/she can take advantage of Cougar m er­
chandise and trip packages. A m em ber also has the oppor­
tunity to win prizes at meetings, athletic events and other
functions.
“For students who say there is never anything to do, this
is a great opportunity for them ,” Savoie said. “There is

Two conference wins over
W isconsin-Parkside
and
Lewis University last w eek­
end have the S IU E volleyball
team contending in the G reat
Lakes Valley Conference.
T he C ougars dispatched
W isconsin-Parkside fairly eas­
ily 15-6, 15-3, 16-14 in their
first contest of the w eekend in
Kenosha, Wis. on Friday.
“We played w ell,” said
head
coach
Sandy
M ontgom ery on M onday
m orning.
“ I t ’s
halfw ay
through the season and w e’re
stepping up to the challenge.”
O n Saturday, S IU E had a
tougher challenge with Lewis
U niversity in Rom eoville, 111.,
but pulled o u t a 17-15, 14-16,
15-10,15-8 victory.
The n atio n ’s leading block­
er, M ichelle G ilm an, led the
C ougar attack with five of the
team ’s 16 total blocks. She
also contributed 16 kills and a
service ace.
S IU E ’s next test was a n on­
co n ference gam e against
F erris State. The five set
m atch was taken by Ferris
State.
The C ougar’s record is 10-7
with a GLVC m ark of 3-1.
“W e’ve played som e tough
com p etitio n
lately,” said
M ontgomery. “B ut the team is
coming along well. We seem
to be getting b etter and better
as our schedule goes along.”
S IÛ E will be involved in
m ore GLVC com petition this
week.

Club hockey coming to SIUE this fall
By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
H ockey fans beware. SIU E has gone
hockey.
Starting this fall SIU E will introduce
C ougar ice hockey as a club sport.
R unning at the helm of the new team
is Bill Misiak who has coached around
the area for the past six years in youth
leagues.
H e started last February checking
out the area to see if a hockey team was
needed.
“The biggest problem students right
out of high school have is finding some
w here to go to play hockey,” Misiak
said.
A nd he used that reasoning to get a
hockey team here.
The intent of C ougar hockey is to

build a successful team which instills p ro ­
fessionalism in its players.
These players are high school gradu­
ates who like to play hockey and those

SIUE Club Ice Hockey Tryouts
Oct. 5 and 6 at Cahokia, 111., at
5:30 a.m.
Registration meeting is Oct. 2
in the Cahokia Room of the
U.C. at 4 p.m.
who were not selected to play at the
Division I or II level.
Misiak said the goal of C ougar hock­
ey is to illustrate the positive benefits it

could have on the SIU E sports program
if it would be added.
Since a club sport is not a recognized
organization within SIU E it does not
receive any funding from the school.
This requires the players and program
to be self-supporting.
S IU E has established a bank account
for Cougar hockey which has the same
tax guidelines as o th er U niversity
accounts.
This allows individuals, organizations,
and businesses to m ake donations to
the ice hockey program . These dona­
tions are essential for the success of the
program .
Tryouts for the new team will be held
at Cahokia on Oct. 5 and 6th at 5:30 a.m.
Call Misiak at 692-2159 for any questions.
A registration m eeting will held in the
C ahokia Room of the University C enter
on Oct. 2 at 4 p.m.

The kickoff for CABA will be Friday, Oct. 4,

Savoie said CABA is a fun-filled group
which will bring all organizations together to
cheer-on the Cougars.
“If we get the fraternities, sororities and
o th er student organizations to join us, we can
build a trem endous hom ecourt advantage that
every school would want to have, “ Savoie said.
“CABA gives the students an opportunity to
have fun and m ake new friends,”
