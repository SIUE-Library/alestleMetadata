letter to the editor

Parking fee increases—just another
way for the university to make money

Contracts are made to be
broken—even in the NBA

Some of the reasons for raising parking sticker rates seem m ore than a little
preposterous!
To start out with, the article about SIU E having lower parking sticker prices
than a lot of other schools. So what! Because the price of gas is over $3.00 a
gallon in Europe, does that mean the gas price in the U.S. should increase 300
percent? I certainly do not think so. But that is what that article is saying in
essence.
The next thing said is that all this extra money is needed for repairs and
upkeep. Really, how did it suddenly get so much m ore expensive to maintain
parking lots and walkways? If it has, publish the cost for the last five years, then
publish the reasons for such a L A R G E increase using the D O L L A R amounts
that have changed.
The last one reason is the money is going to be used for building this, that,
and the other thing. Well, “th at” is nice, and “this” I’m sure is real good, but
why are the parking fees paying for it? Also, if the parking prices do pay for it,
does that m ean that before too long parking fees will be paying for everything
new built at campus? O ne m ore thing to ask here—if it is for building something
new, will parking prices go back down after these things are finished, or is it just
another-way for the university to make more money in the long run?
Randall L Rolle

letter to the editor____________________________________

University should sit back and
learn from Professor Hudlin
This letter is being written following some disturbing developm ents on
campus. It is written with deep concern over the lot of a dynamic, respected
and inspiring m em ber of faculty who finds himself in the unenviable task of
fighting for his job. Professor E d Hudlin is know to most of us as a professor
in the departm ent of philosophy. W hether he shall stay as such remains to be
seen.
Hudlin is undoubtedly an exemplary philosophy lecturer. He has guided
scores of students through challenging philosophy courses. It is amazing how
well he relates to students who are having difficulties in their philosophy
studies. Hudlin is a selfless lecturer who lends students sizeable portions of
his free time. I know this for a fact, I was one of a group of students who
worked with Hudlin on a philosophy course that would otherwise have been
most frustrating. T here is no doubt that Hudlin is well versed in his material.
Hudlin has given a great deal to philosophical studies here at SIUE. H e is
definitely an outspoken m em ber of faculty and one can’t help but wonder
w hether this new-found predicam ent has som ething to do with this. I have
benefitted from the vast knowledge of this interesting and lively professor
and would hate to think that some incoming student may be denied this
opportunity.
Now, Hudlin is currently under paid suspension. Wasted resources?
Definitely.
H ere is a teacher who invested a great deal of time and money in acquiring
the credentials necessary to become an instructor. All instructors at SIUE
definitely rem em ber their seemingly endless “days in the wilderness.”
W hat makes his achievement even m ore significant is the fact that he
overcame the social and academic obstacles of his time. Ask Hudlin about his
background then sit back tight and marvel. Ask him about his experiences
and sit back and marvel. There is a lot we can learn from Hudlin—let’s all sit
back and learn.

ID Center should return fees for name change
This letter is in response to a letter to the Alestle editor on M arch 19, 1996,
by Regina Youngblood in which she stated that Jim Stout should check his facts
before he draws conclusions.
The following illustrates my experience with the ID Card center at the
University Center:
Fact: I had a new ID card made and it cost me $10.00. My card was not lost,
stolen or damaged. I turned my card into the ID Card C enter because of a name
change.
If I have to pay $10.00 to have my name changed on my ID card, you should
say so clearly. If you don’t say so, you should have to return all the fees you have
collected for a name change.
That is a fact!

This letter is in response to David E llet’s com m ent on M ahm oud Abdul-Rauf.
Ellet stated that A bdul-R auf had an obligation to stand in a dignified m anner as
his contract had specified and, by following the rules, he would receive an
“am ount of money that most Am ericans will not see during their life time.”
Ellet must not understand that contracts are made to be broken, especially
when one party decides that a contract is in conflict with hum an reasoning or
issues oppression. How did this country break away from England? How was
civil rights indoctrinated in this country? How did slaves receive their freedom?
How did women receive the right to vote?
All these cases involved persons who went against laws and norms to express
hum an issues that were not popular at the time of their propagation. All these
“contracts” were broken. The breaking of contracts or agreem ents, in some
cases, is a sign of evolving from one state to another.
Chris Jackson evolved to M ahmoud Abdul-Rauf. Ideals that he stood for as
Chris Jackson no longer apply to Abdul-Rauf. A bdul-R auf will not “sell-out” his
principles for “an am ount of money that most Am ericans will not see during
their life tim e,” maybe that is why he is seen as “anti-patriotic,” apple pie has
become toxic!
On March 14, A bdul-R auf announced that he would stand for the anthem.
Instead o f pledging loyalty to the flag, he will pray for the oppressed in this
country and the world. Maybe one day A m erica will live up to its creed and
constitution, but until then, NO SELL-OUTS!
O ye who believe, stand out firm ly fo r justice, as witnesses to God, even
as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin. and whether it be
against the rich or p o o r ... (qur’an 4:135)
Hakeem Abdul-Rasheed
Jr., MSA Vice-president

editorial________________________________________________

NBA took constitutional
right away from Abdul-Rauf
In response to David E llet’s article about my editorial regarding M ahmoud
Abdul-Rauf, I just have to say, whatever.
A bdul-R auf came into the N BA as just a basketball player. G etting a
paycheck was not his only objections. He played a game he loved and just so
happened to get paid for it. But after he accepted Allah as his God, he learned
that there are more precious things in this life and that money is not
everything. That is why he contem plated retiring from the NBA at an early
age. D o you think that many other Am ericans would give up all that money for
their belief in God?
True, he signed a contract that stipulates that players must stand and line up
in a dignified posture,” and for many games he did not stand. This had been
going on for some time. Why didn’t the N BA stop this before all of this
publicity? Instead, they went to the D enver Nuggets to try to get them to
discipline him. Because he was not harming anyone, they just had him staying
in the lockerroom while the anthem was being played. But in some arenas
where the lockerrooms were not close to the stadium floor, he would go to the
sideline and either stretch or sit and pray. T hat’s where he got into trouble. But
why? Just because it’s in his contract? To me th at’s garbage.
If the N BA is so concerned about the national anthem , why is it played at
least 20 minutes before game time in some arenas? Why isn’t it played right
before the tip off and shown on television for all of America to see? If it’s so
im portant, why don’t all vendors stop selling and all fans be required to stay at
their seats and not go wandering around. A nd, shouldn’t all restroom s be shut
and locked during this time, after all, if sitting down during the national anthem
is disrespectful, then what do you call it when som eone is using the restroom
during it.
I wish A bdul-R auf didn’t decide to stand up. H e lost what every American
was born with—the freedom of expression. It’s a shame that in this world today
that money seems to rule everything. I t’s a shame that the NBA would take his
money away from him, and they really don’t have a right to do that. They are
not paying him, the D enver Nuggets are paying him.
And h ere’s som ething else to think about. I bet you that Abdul-R auf, if
given the option to sit and pray during the anthem then play without being
paid, he would’ve. It wasn’t just the money the NBA took away from him, it
was his chance to do something he loved—play basketball.

CU student files civil lawsuit over fraternity hazing
B O U L D E R , Colo. (A P) —A form er University of
Colorado student has filed a civil lawsuit against
the Phi K appa Tau fraternity and 22 of its m em bers
in connection with a hazing incident last fall.
The lawsuit was filed Friday in B oulder District
Court by M ichael “B o” M ontoya and his mother,
Connie M ather. It alleges crimes ranging from
negligence to false im prisonm ent to assault.
M ontoya and his family claim he nearly died on
Oct. 24 after fraternity m em bers tied him up and
allegedly forced liquor down his throat. M ontoya,
then 19, was a fraternity pledge seeking full
m em bership into the house.
A ttorney Stephen Justino, who is representing
M ontoya and M ather, said his clients hope to
recover dam ages from the fraternity.

“We think the conduct was outrageous,” Justino
said.
M ontoya and M ather are seeking unspecified
damages.
The lawsuit claims M ontoya was deprived of
medicine he was required to take daily and that
m em bers blocked a doorway when M ather showed
up and tried to take her son home.
M ather claims her son suffers from an adrenaline
deficiency that can be fatal if he loses
consciousness. She said she and her husband
dragged their son out of the fraternity and back to
his dorm room, where they had to force medicine
down him to save his life.
Named in the com plaint is the national Phi
K appa Tau fraternity, its CU chapter and house

corporation, and 22 of its members.
The local chapter of the fraternity has not
com m ented on the suit.
B ut throughout a police investigation, fraternity
m em bers denied the allegations m ade by M ontoya
and his mother.
Two fraternity m em bers and the fraternity’s
president on Feb 29 on behalf of the organization
pleaded no contest to m isdem eanor charges of
providing alcohol to a minor. A judge gave the two
m em bers six-month deferred sentences with 24
hours of com m unity service.
The judge also ordered the house’s m em bers to
perform a total of 200 hours o f com m unity service.

G o a h e a d a n d r o c k t h e C r a d le o f T h o r n s
I was very pleased that the band sounded
good on the album as well as in concert. COT has
a dark, m oody sound which is intensified by the
heavy, serious subject m atter. A fan of the bands
listed in the third paragraph will enjoy this CD.
Just about anybody will get a kick out of their
M otley C rue im personation.

By Lenon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
In my review of the 13mg show about a
m onth a go, I m entioned a band nam ed
Cradle of Thorns that really stole the show.
I now have the new C O T album. Download
This, in my little, sweaty, rock critic hands.
And I like it.
W hen I encountered C O T at the Galaxy,
I had no idea who they were and didn’t
know anything about their sound. The band
started playing, and by the end of their set I
was im pressed by their energy, power, and
showmanship. O ff stage, they were very
polite and willing to talk with the crowd and
“hang out.” I like that in a band.
A sticker on the album packaging calls
out to fans of Rage Against the Machine,
311, and Korn. C O T is similar to these
oth er bands, but also true to themselves.
Listeners will appreciate the fact that COT
has their own sound as well. They are not as
choppy as Rage, not as ska as 311, and not
quite as hardcore as Korn.
The album clocks in at just over an hour
with 18 tracks, as lead singer Ty Elam
rap/sings through pounding beats and crunching guitars as the band delivers
it’s messages dealing with topics of racism, TV evangelists, and developing
technology. The band takes a strong stance on a wide range of political and
m oral topics.
In the song, “Subtract,” C O T talks about guns and domestic violence.
“T here’s a m an and a wom en and a gun/ Fair is the fight minus one/ one can
think clearly and one has the strength/ one fights fairly and one has his way.”
The band d oesn’t sit back on this topic or any of the others that it tackles. Ty
gets in your face and delivers his opinions openly and honestly.
The song, “Picture Perfect,” talks about utopia, a world without prejudice.
In concert, the band introduced it as an anti-racism song. The main line of the
chorus is, “Welcome to the place/ where the color of your face/ isn’t even
noticed.”
To prove the band has a sense of hum or also, they do an amusing cover of
“Shout at the D evil” by Motley Crue. In concert, Ty was wearing an “I Love
Sunday School” T-shirt on stage. Classic.

Local Music News
Sometim es it’s not so bad w hen a band breaks
up. Uncle Tupelo split, and know we have Wile«
and Son Volt to listen to.
N ot too long ago the local band A gatha
Honey called it quits. Now, in the afterm ath, two
great bands, Vegabasin and the Geisha Men, have
em erged to help ease our pain.
I caught both bands playing at the Stagger Inn
on Friday night, and it was definitely worth the
price of admission. They were opening up for
A lto n ’s hardcore w orkhorses Back of Dave, who,
by the way, should m ake a jum p to the next level
very soon. They’ve paid their dues!
Fans o f the now defunct Sunny Day Real
Estate owe it to themselves to check out both
Vegabasin and the Geisha Men. The Vegabasin
sound is m ore rem iniscent of lighter Sunny Day, which is a very good thing.
The songs seem to weave back and forth, alm ost entrancing you as you sit back
and enjoy the ride. A band like this will be good to have in our local scene.
The Geisha M en seem to com bine the sounds of Sunny Day with the angst
and energy of the Cham paign, IL bands such as the Poster Children, Hum, and
Menthol. The result is a heavy com bination power, feedback, and fuzz that
really hits hard. The two groups com plim ented each other very well. That,
along with Back of Dave, m ade it a great night of music for only $3.
Both of these post-A gatha H oney bands are loaded with talent and
potential that, hopefully, w on’t go unnoticed for long. If there is any justice in
this world, extrem ely m ediocre local bands, like Stir, will stop signing major
record contracts so talented, deserving bands such as Vegabasin and the Geisha
M en can.
Look for both bands playing local clubs because they truly put on quite a
show. Hopefully they will stay together for a long time to come, because there
are many bands that have m ade it with a lot less talent.

The call is out for volunteers. To
call is a quest and dedication within

itself. Two SIUE students volunteer twice a w eek
to tutor kindergarten through sixth grade
students.
Portia Goree and LaShonda Sanders tutor at
the Grace United Methodist Church, located at
6011 Forest Blvd. in Washington Park, 111. The
program was started n the fall of 1995 as a way
to get kids off the streets and, in the process,
provide tutoring, leadership and role models to
kids.
Goree, a 23-year-old senior majoring in TVR
from Washington Park explains how she becam e
involved in the volunteer project.
“Initially, it was a project for my TVR 452 class
to videotape a community organization. We w ere
shooting a film asking tutors why they volunteer
their services,” Goree said. “I enjoy the one on
one tutoring. To me, it’s very rewarding. I see that
a lot of black kids are so behind in education. I
thought maybe I could help in som e way.”
Soon Goree becam e so involved that she
decided to take the time to becom e a tutor
herself. But she didn’t stop there. She took it
u p o n herself to grab as m any friends as
possible—and that is how Sanders, 20, becam e
involved.

Burges said.

“These kids

continues to tutor the kids in love,” Burges said.
“We needed help and Portia got LaShonda. And LaShonda is doing the same
thing as a sophom ore that Portia is now doing as a senior,” Burges said.
Burges went on to say that Goree and Sanders have brought the tutoring
program to life. Burges hope that the program can expand next fall to four or
five days a week.
Back on the other side Arteenet seems to have a hard time solving a problem.
Goree looks up and replies.
“She gets frustrated a lot and doesn't want to do the w ork.”
While Goree is saying this, Arteenet has her head buried in her arms,
obviously em barrassed by the whole incident. After a little coaching from Portia,
she starts to write again. With moments such as that one, Goree feels an

“Most definitely. I’ll be there saying, ‘Go Portia, Go Portia’,” Sanders said. Also, in a couple of
weeks a ceremony, will be held to honor Portia for her time and dedication with the kids.
By 5:30, after much guidance and friendship, parents and grandparents arrive to pick up the

Cougars back in action with six games in three days
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor

Melissa Wathen/A/esf/e
The Cougar baseball team will be getting down and dirty in the Great
Lakes Valley Conference with three doubleheaders this weekend.

Tennis gets
off on the
wrong foot
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor

A fter having the inclimate w eather stall
the season temporarily, the SIU E baseball
team faces the unenviable task of playing
six games in three days this w eekend when
a trio of G reat Lakes Valley C onference
foes come to town.
O n Friday, the Cougars will host Lewis
at a location that at this time is unknown.
Following Lewis into tow n will be
N o rth ern K entucky on S aturday and
Indianapolis on Sunday. Those two
d o ubleheaders will be played in
Collinsville at W oodland Park.
The No. 7 ranked Cougars, 11-4 overall
and 1-1 in the GLVC, are looking forward
to returning to action and are hoping the
w eather will cooperate.
“Hopefully the w eather will break,”
head coach G ary Collins said W ednesday
afternoon while he searched for a field to
play the Friday gam es on. “E veryone
wants to play again.”
While playing six games in three days
seems tough, Collins said he thought his
team could handle it. H e said they have
enough pitching to carry them through
w ithout wearing out any arms.
With their hom e field not in playing
condition yet, Collins said the team has
had some problem s getting the proper
preparations for games.
“None of our infielders has been able
to field a ground ball, except when we

were down south,” Collins said. H e added
that the lack of practice has led to some
defensive troubles during games.
A lthough he is concerned about his
team ’s defensive perform ance so far, he
thinks some recent changes will help the
team in the long run.
O th er than the defensive perform ance
of the team , Collins seems to be pretty
pleased with where his team stands.
H e said th e pitching has been
everything he expected and he is really
happy with the way they’ve thrown the
ball.
O n offense, Collins realizes that the
team ’s overall batting average (.310) isn’t
as high as it could be, but he is pleased
with the timely hits the guys have been
getting.
“W e’ve done a p retty good job of
hitting when we needed to, but w e’re still
not satisfied,” he said.
The C ougars’ offense has been led by
second-basem an Brian Geluck with a .442
average and third-basem an Jeff Silvey,
who is hitting .420.
Collins said that while these two have
been hitting the ball well, some other guys
are starting to hit the ball better and he
thinks that they will all be hitting much
b etter in the near future.
W ith the w eath er causing some
problems, it’s hard for the team to develop
any kind of consistency.
Collins said that when the team does
start clicking together, they can be very
good.

H alberg in another three set thriller. H e won 61, (4-6), 6-4.
G em inn won by a forfeit after the guy he
was playing storm ed off the court when he lost
the first set tie breaker 8-6.
The Cougars this year have the top three
positions filled with tough experience players
and then round out the bottom three with
young inexperienced talent. So they will have
to play good tennis in order to survive the
tough schedule they usually have.
“We had a team m eeting after the trip from
Kansas and we decided we needed to practice
harder, which consist of m ore wind sprints and
things like that. Plus we are going to try to
m ake a run at the conference title. A nd if
anything positive cam e ou t of this past
weekend then it was that,” Logan said.
The Cougars believe that with a couple
m ore matches under their belts, they could of
had a better weekend. Their first matches were
against team s w ho have already had
experience this season.
“It was a tough way to start off the season,
but seeing the enthusiasm at the late practice
last night (8:30-10-30) things look like they are
ready to change,” R eede said.
R eeded added, “Personally it’s been tough

The Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville softball team will get its first opportunity
to host a G reat Lakes Valley C onference tournam ent this weekend.
Sort of.
D ue to inclem ent w eather at the o th er GLVC schools, SIU E will host both conference
clusters at the Collinsville Sports Com plex Saturday and Sunday.
The Cougars, now 10-5 on the year, were supposed to spend the weekend in Owensboro, Ky.,
for a league cluster with Kentucky Wesleyan, Lewis, N orthern Kentucky, St. Joseph’s and
Quincy. Bellarm ine was supposed to host the other cluster with Indianapolis, IU PU -Fort
Wayne, Southern Indiana and W isconsin-Parkside in Louisville, Ky.
H ead Coach Sandy M ontgom ery said SIU E was glad to be in a position to help out the
conference in this capacity.
“I’m elated we could be there for the conference, and I’m excited to have all the
(conference) schools at one place because it seldom happens,” M ontgom ery said. “A special
thanks goes out to the city of Collinsville and its recreation district for allowing us to do this at
such short notice.”
O n Saturday, SIU E faces N orthern Kentucky at 11 a.m., Lewis at 1 p.m. and N orthern
Kentucky at 3 p.m. On Sunday, the Cougars take on Kentucky Wesleyan at 9 a.m., Lewis at 1
p.m. and Kentucky Wesleyan at 3 p.m.
This weekend is the first-ever conference action for the Cougars. Last week at the
Collinsville Sports Complex, SIU E went 4-1 in its own Cougar Classic.
SIU E canceled its Thursday doubleheader with IU PU -Indianapolis due to the weather. The
games have been rescheduled for A pril 3rd.

take three years off like 1 did and then come
back it takes a little while to get back in
condition.”
The Cougars are know getting ready for
som e conference matches. They need to make
these count if they want to m ake that run at
the title.
“We have a bunch of conference matches
coming up so we are going to have to start
working hard and 1 believe we found that out
over the weekend.,” Logan said.
The m en w eren’t the only SIU E players to
have a tough time in Kansas. The women,
coming off an 11-0 spring dropped two straight
to start off their season.
“ We played tw o pow erhouse teams.
N orthwest is ranked 18th in the nation and
W ashburn would probably be in the top 25 if
they ranked team s that high. But they are
ranked 7th in the m idwest region while
N orthwest is 5th,” Logan said.
N orthw est M issouri State blanked the
Cougars 7-0 and then W ashburn beat them 5-2.
The Cougars did get good victories from Kellie
Kane and Layla Rosenfeld in the loses.
“Kellie played great tennis at No. 3. She
played dorm good points and I am really proud
off her. A nd Layla won her match at No. 6 with
good sm art tennis. She showed a good example
of a good way to win,” Logan said.

low couch potato. Watch how one act o f kindness can lighten up the day for the
recipient!
