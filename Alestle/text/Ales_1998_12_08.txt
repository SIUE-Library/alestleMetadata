SIUE remains a bargain
BY BARBARA DUMOULIN
NEWS STRINGER
SIUE is bucking the national
college tuition trend.
The average increase in
tuition and fees around the nation
at four-year colleges and
universities is 5 percent,
according to the College Board,
an information source on college
costs.
But SIUE has increased
those costs by only 3 percent in

the last year for resident
undergraduate students and will
be substantially reducing the cost
of attendance for nonresident
undergraduate students..
Beginning in fall 1999, the
cost of tuition and fees for a
nonresident
undergraduate
student will decrease from three
times to two times the cost of a
resident student.

$6,826 per year in tuition and
fees will pay $4,888.
According to Daniel Corbett,
budget director and special
assistant to the chancellor,
SIUE’s unique budget-planning
process has helped bring about
these cost-controlling measures.
Corbett said that innovative
changes over the past several
years by the SIU Board of
Trustees have made this school
the first in the state to adopt a
planning process that both
extends for four years and limits
proposed undergraduate cost
increases to the projected rate of
increase in the Consumer Price
Index.
“We are using a four-year
budget-planning
process,”
Corbett said. “This makes us a
leader in the state. We set the
tuition for first two years and
project it for the next two years.
That allows a parent or student to
look at what the costs will be for
the entire four years.”
The CPI has increased
around 3 percent per year for the
past several years and is
projected to be about the same
next year.
The decision to reduce the
nonresident costs came about in
an effort to attract and retain both
international
and
regional
students. The board of trustees
anticipates
that
increased
enrollment will result from more
competitive costs. That will serve
to offset any negative effect on
income from the lower rates.

1700 SIUE Cougar faithful pack the gym
ALESTLE STAFF REPORT
Nobody walked away with
$25,000 or a new Dodge, but
“Pack the Gym" night at the
Vadalabene Center brought back
The Red Zone and a surge in
school spirit.
More than 1,700 fans of the
Cougars saw both the men's and
women’s team chalk up victories
over the Greyhounds from the
University of Indianapolis. The

women’s team won 83-63 while
the men scored 79 points to their
opponent’s 66. The men’s win
was the 300th career victory for
basketball
coach
John
Marganthaler.
“This was the biggest crowd
we ever had in December,”
Assistant Sports Director Nick
Adams said.
Fans were treated to more
than
winning
basketball
performances
Thursday.

Entertainment included the
chance to win a 1999 Dodge
Intrepid by sinking a 60-foot putt.
Irene Middleton was the
lucky education sophomore who
held the ticket called for the
putting contest.
Unfortunately Middleton did
not make the putt, however she
did not leave empty-handed. She
received a Bud Light compact
disc case, a Budweiser T-shirt
and a Budweiser mouse pad.

Light candle for Kwanzaa
BY TONY WATT
NEWS STRINGER
The
SIUE
English
Department will help light a
candle for the upcoming
Kwanzaa celebration.
A Pre-Kwanzaa Forum will
be at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 15,
in the East St. Louis Municipal
Building, 301 River Park Drive.
The Pre-Kwanzaa Forum
will feature a candle-lighting
ritual performed by the Soular
Systems
Ensemble.
Poetry
readings will be part of the
forum. The program will include
poet Quincy Troupe.
Eugene B. Redmond, an
SIUE English professor and head
of the Eugene B. Redmond
Writers Club, is organizing the
event marking Kwanzaa, an
African-American holiday that
begins Dec. 26.
The event is sponsored by
the SIUE Department of English

Language and Literature, the
East St. Louis Cultural Revival
Campaign Committee, the Black
River Writers Press/Quiet Time
Publishing and the Eugene B.
Redmond Writers Club.
The
candle-lighting
ceremony will include readings
of KwanSaba poetry, Redmond
said.
“KwanSaba poetry consists
of seven lines of seven words
with seven letters in each word,”
Redmond said.
KwanSaba is a cross-cultural
poetic form
dedicated to
Kwanzaa, and each poem must
address one of the seven
principles of Kwanzaa, he said.
The principles are: Umoja
(unity); Kujichagulia (selfdetermination); Ujima (collective
responsibility);
Ujamaa
(cooperative economics); Nia
(purpose); Kuumba (creativity);
and Imani (faith).

“I feel like Louie, the
Budweiser lizard,” Middleton
said. “I could have been huge.”
There was also the chance to
win $25,000 but again no one
managed to sink two of three
half-court basketball shots.
However, two students did
win tuition waivers for the spring
semester. One man and one
woman of the six who competed
during the halftime breaks sank
the ball with a layup.
No one walked away emptyhanded, thanks to area merchants
who donated coupons and
goodies, according to Jessica
Neal, public relations chair for
Student
Government.
McDonald’s, Applebee’s, Pizza
Hut, The Bagel Tree and others
were among the contributors.

Water bottles as well as hot
dogs, chips and lemonade were
handed out before the game.
There was also a dance and free
food after the games.
During the games, Cougar
cheerleaders occasionally threw
SIUE sweat shirts and T-shirts
into the crowd.
Red T-shirts and other red
clothing were much in evidence
that night as boosters cheered the
Cougars. The Red Zone, a
particularly vocal group of fans,
was loud and strong, bringing
back an SIUE tradition.
Pack the Gym night “is a
good way for the students to
come out and have a good time
while also supporting our teams,”
Sports Information Director Eric
Hess said.
According to Neal, the event
was “an exciting way to bridge
the gap between faculty and
students.”

Event raises funds for Mitch victims
BY RICHARD GEISLEN
FOR THE ALESTLE
Catholics gathered in a
Advent celebration at the
Religious Center Friday and also
helped the victims of Hurricane
Mitch.
“People there are in a very
desperate situation,” said Nassef
Girgif, director of the Catholic
Campus Ministry.
The celebration included
Scripture readings, music, dance
and presentations
of the
devastation left by Mitch.

w R oi\iq pIaces? TIhe AIe stIe is

The presentations showed
the destruction and living
conditions that the Honduran and
Nicaraguan people are suffering.
“Houses are made out of plastic
bags and cardboard boxes,”
Girgif said.
Donations were collected
from students and faculty and
$500 was raised. The money
according to Girgif will then be
split and sent to Honduras and
Nicaragua.
In addition to the Catholic
campus ministry’s efforts, Jenny

Zelaya, a graduate student from
Honduras has been collecting
items to send to the troubled
country.
Girgif was very thankful for
the efforts of everyone who
participated.
“I would like to thank the
community of SIUE for their
show of support and global
solidarity to reach out beyond our
immediate surroundings and to
be of help to the people of
Honduras in their time of need,”
Girgif said.

Food, glorious food
SIUE food services offers a variety o f delicious choices
but is it good fo r you? Or is it all just grease on a bun ?
The university has taken a
successful step in making
residential college dining more
attractive to students. The Food
Service administrators have
done a lot in the past four to five
years to increase variety and
options, but they have not really
increased the quality of the food.
The Delyte W. Morris
University Center has recently
been renovated. The Deli
Express has been relocated and
Chick-fil-A is a new addition.
The open self-service areas are
great for those students who
want to grab food quickly.
Unfortunately,
options
are
limited for the student who
requires special dietary needs,
seeks weight reduction or has
other food-related concerns.
My primary concern is that
the university offers limited
options if you choose to make a
healthy meal selection. So, I
took it upon myself to walk
around and see what my options
are on campus. First, I looked in
the Founders Hall food wagon.
To my surprise, it offers pre­
made salads, bagels and
sandwich and soup of the day.
Next, I journeyed to Peck Hall
where I found a vending
machines
for
gourmet
microwaveable meals. Then, I
walked over to the Morris
University Center. The Cougar
Den had garden burgers, beef
phillies, chicken phillies and
fried fish sandwiches.
Ann, a graduate student,
warned me about the philly
sandwich. She told me it has
more than a small family’s daily
allowance of fat. Judy, a staff

employee, alerted me about the
fish sandwich. She told me it has
grease dripping from it.
The self-service hot-food
bar had a good variety of
vegetables, baked potatoes and
grilled chicken. In the vicinity of
the hot-food bar, there was an
ample salad bar, yogurt, premade
sandwiches and bagels. The Deli
Express has a wide variety of sub
sandwiches. Chick-fil-A has a
grilled chicken sandwich that
needs more than pickles to give
it a tasty flavor.
Unfortunately, the food
wagon in Woodland Hall did not
offer the same items found in
Founders Hall; instead they had
the healthy choice of an apple or
banana.
I realize it is hard to
accommodate everyone, but I
feel there should be more
options for health-conscious and
variety-minded
students.
Southern Illinois University
Edwardsville has failed to reach
its full potential in providing a
wider variety of quality foods. I
have the option of eating oncampus or bringing my meals
from home. Unfortunately,
students who live in the
residence halls can’t cook in
their dorm rooms and are
restricted to campus meal plans.
I hope that in the near future, the
Food Service administrators will
develop equal amounts of vision
and practicality and initiate
programs to facilitate the
nutrition needs of all students.

Clalien’s Believe it w Net, Part Twc,

The Wcnst Night

BY JIM DALTO N
LIFE S TY LE S T R IN G E R
* Disclaimer: The names and
some o f the details o f this story
have been changed in order to
conceal the identity o f the
actual people involved.
II
It was about 10:30 that
evening when Denise called
me. She is one of my sister's
good friends and I’ve known
her since she was a little girl.
She always has a calm,
easygoing personality, which is
why I like her. However, she
didn’t sound like her usual
self. Her voice trembled with
fright and her sentences were
barely coherent.
“Denise, is everything
allright?”
“Jim, I need to leave my
apartment ... something’s
happened, I need to ... Can I
come over there?”
A minute or two later I
heard her car screech into the
parking lot. I hurried down the
steps and out of the apartment
complex. Her son was in his
pajamas and looked like he’d
just woke up. Denise was
holding her daughter in one
arm and the steering wheel in
the other. Her eyes were
fearfully darting around as if
trying to discover some hidden
ambush. Without a word, she
grabbed my hand and we
hustled into rny apartment.
Denise told me the whole
story. If I hadn’t known her for
so long, I’d probably call her a
liar. But, I could tell in her

eyes, in her voice and in the
way she securely held her baby,
that she was telling the truth.
“You should probably call
the police or something.”
“What the hell am I gonna
tell them? That some freakin’
thing came in to my kitchen
and started throwing stuff
around. That it tried to kill my
daughter with a floating plate.
You know what they’d think?
The next day they’d have a
goddamned social worker at
my house ready to assess my
mental state and take my
kids away.”
“Sorry, I just thought... let
me get you something for your
arms. They look pretty bad.”
That
night
Denise
eventually calmed down and
even eventually lay on the
couch, but she never let go of
Amanda. I don’t think she
slept at all.
After Billy caught the
school bus, we went over to her
apartment. The place was in
shambles and any doubt I had
about her story was instantly
erased. It looked as if a bomb
had exploded in the kitchen.
As
we
cleaned
the
apartment, her daughter slept
in her cradle which was never
more than a few feet away
from her mother. I left about
noon, but promised I’d come
back later that evening.
When I arrived at her
apartment around 6 p.m.,
everything seemed a lot more
calm. Billy was sprawled out
on the living room carpet
playing with some action
figures. Denise watched the

T rook a seat iffif the couch
and immediately the television
started rumbhngr-Nw knowing
what else to do, T g o t up and
tried to hold it steady. That’s
when 1 feir what Denise had
told me about. It was coming. I
could feel the evil entering the
room, and my stomach twisted
into a burning, nauseated knot.
Through the charred circle in
the wall, a dark form slid into
the kitchen. The television
shook more ferociously and
squirmed out of my hands. It
crashed to the floor and began
twitching like a gasping fish out
of water.
The ominous form hung in
the kitchen, bouncing up and
down as if laughing or crying.
Within the hideous mass a
female visage seemed to float
through the shadowy form. The
mouth hung wide open and
appeared to be screaming, but
the only sound in the room was
our own labored breathing.
From inside the mass a
long appendage, much like an
arm, extended from the being to
a drawer next to the sink. The
drawer shot out from the cheap
cabinetry and spilled a pile of
knives. One of the steak knives
floated up from the stack and
over to the kitchen wall.
Guided by the will of the evil
presence, it sliced into the wall
with quick, reckless slashes.
The possessed knife was clearly
forming a word and when it
lifelessly fell to the ground, the
message it left was simple, yet
terrifying. The word Amanda
in crude capital letters lay
menacingly on the wall as a
dark, bloodlike liquid dripped
from
the
newly
carved
inscription.
“Mommy, I’m scared,”
whimpered Billy who hid
behind his mother. Denise put
her free hand on his shoulder
and took a slow step to the door.
The couch was propelled
across the living room and
slammed up against the door.
Behind me, I heard all the
windows thrown shut. We were
trapped.

In a
spirit spun across
The walls, floors
ceiling began to tremble und
its power, pictures smashed to
the floor, light bulbs exploded,
shelves ripped themselves from
the wall and streams of crimson
blood poured up through the
carpet. In the distance, I could
hear what sounded like the
screams of small children.
Denise
was
clutching
Amanda with her terrified
young son crying and clenching
two small handfuls of her jeans.
“Come on, let’s get the
hell out of here!” I yelled,
grabbing a chair and running
toward the sliding-glass door. I
swung the chair as hard as I
could, but the glass only
suffered a small crack. I swung
again and the glass shattered.
Turning back to Denise, I saw
the mass swarm upon us like a
horde of enraged bees.
A reeking vomitus heat
dissipated from the murderous
demon and almost burned my
skin. It lassoed itself around
the baby’s neck and the child
began choking.
“You can’t have her!”
Denise yelled and vainly tried
to free her gagging child. I
hurled the chair at the hellish
being, but it sailed right
through it.
“Billy, run outside and
get help!” I shouted and
grabbed his shoulders and
pushed him through the
glassless sliding door.
Quickly, I looked back at
Denise who was yelling and
frantically swinging her fists.
Amanda had turned blue and
her eyes began to bulge out of
her skull. Not knowing what
else to do, I ran at Denise and
Amanda and tackled them. The
mass’s deadly stranglehold was
temporarily broken. The three
of us fell backward onto the
sharp glass fragments, which
reopened
the
unhealed
lacerations on Denise’s arms.
We helplessly lay on the floor as
the dark soul charged toward
us. For that brief moment, I was
sure I was going to die.
Denise instinctively flung
her wounded arms up for
protection and a few drops of
blood splashed upon the
creature. Like a broken vial of
acid eating through a table, her

I quickly glanced at
ise and when our eyes
met, she nodded. Without
any words, we both knew
what to do. I grabbed
Amanda from her and
sprinted toward the door.
Denise confidently stood,
empowered by the awareness
of her weapon. She cupped
her hand
against her
forearm, letting the blood
slowly pool in her hand.
The dark being retreated
and howled a shaky yelp that
almost sounded like a cry for
help. Denise leaped at the
beast and threw her vital life
fluid on the demon.
The blood ripped a
gaping hole in the repulsive
creature. The face floating
inside the mass began to melt
until it burst into an
indistinguishable ball of
flames, and
the mass
harmlessly drifted across the
room. As Denise cupped her
hand to her forearm again,
the
creature
quickly
evacuated the apartment
through the burnt hole in the
wall. The evil was gone and
the apartment was quiet.
Denise and her children
moved out of the apartment
the next day.

Epilogue

In November 1983, Vera
Storm brutally murdered her
two young children in her
Tower Lake apartment (now
known as Cougar Village).
Her eight-year-old son was
fatally beaten with a frying
pan and Amanda, her infant
daughter, was strangled to
death. When authorities
arrived at the scene, she
allegedly repeated, “They
deserved to die.”
The apartment was
closed by the university for
the following semester, but
was opened again in the fall
of 1984. This is the same
apartment Denise lived in
when she saw the poltergeist.
Despite what happened to
her and probably others,
SIUE students unaware of
what happened, are living
there this very day.
