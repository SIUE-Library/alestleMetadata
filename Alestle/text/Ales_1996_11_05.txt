Investigators may build model of
fatal car bomb
AP — Federal investigators say they will try to construct a model of
the car bomb that killed a real estate developer in a country club
parking lot in Tucson, Ariz. Gary Lee Triano, 52, who had ties to local
gambling operations and was reportedly trying to launch casinos
abroad, stepped into the 1989 Lincoln Town Car seconds before it
exploded at the La Paloma Country Club on Friday night. Triano,
whose developments included industrial parks and strip malls, filed for
personal bankruptcy two years ago, listing $40 million in debts.

A mother speaks out on SIDS and the loss of her child
(I would like to dedicate this to the m em ory of my
daughter, Alex Chanel, and my m other, R osetta
Scott, of Chicago, 111., who was with me every step of
the way. I love you.)
The m onth of O ctober is N ational Sudden Infant
D eath Syndrom e A w areness m onth. SIDS,
commonly known as “crib d eath” and dubbed the
silent killer, takes the lives of 7,000 infants a year in
the U.S. SIDS is so devastating because m ost infants
appear to be healthy prior to their deaths. Shortly
before the deaths of m any infants, they appear to
have a slight cold or a sniffle, but doctors cannot
predict that an infant will succumb to SIDS. O n the
afternoon of Oct. 9, SIDS robbed our family of a
beautiful daughter and the right to peace of mind.
Four days prior to the death of my second child,
Alex Chanel Van Lee, born Sept. 13, at 9 a.m. at St.
E lizabeth’s H ospital in G ranite City, I sat in the
living room of my Tower Lake apartm ent and read
the devastating account of a m other whose 4 m onth
old succumbed to SIDS. Im m ediately after reading
the article I went to my d au g h ter’s room and
checked her breathing. Allie (our nicknam e for her),
weighing 9 pounds and laying 21 inches,looked so
full of life and she was doing fine.
The m orning of Oct. 9, seem ed to be just another
ordinary day. I was up alm ost the entire night with
A llie because she usually slept b e tte r in the
mornings and afternoons and slept sparingly through
the night. I placed Allie on the living room sofa, on
her side, and I looked at the clock. It was 7:15 a.m. I
realized th at I was running late and I quickly
showered and got dressed for school, running back
and forth to see how Allie was doing because she
cried w henever we put her down.
My last words to her were in a babylike voice,
“Allie you have to start sleeping at night so everyone
else can get som e rest too, little m am a”.
Then I placed her in her swing, and she looked up
at me and I said to my husband, “Okay, it’s your turn

now, I gotta go.”
A t 2:50 p.m., I hurried hom e from my last class to
play with my 17-month old and my 3 and a half week
old daughters. A nd that is when my entire life
changed in front of my eyes. I picked Allie up and
she was extrem ely pale and lifeless. My eyes and
mind knew that she was no longer living, but my
heart kept saying hold on, hold on.... I called 911,
and I was instructed to adm inister CPR to Allie. My
husband was crying heavily and irying to resuscitate
her. Shortly after, the police and the ambulance
arrived. My husband went in the am bulance and my
oldest daughter and I were driven by the R esident
A ssistant of our building.
The police and doctors were so very cordial, and
w hether they know it or not, they are the ones that
kept me sane. I kept asking them if my baby was
alright and they just kept saying they were working
on her. Giving me hope in a hopeless situation.
Saturday, Oct. 13 was A llie’s funeral. I didn’t think 1
would m ake it. I was so afraid to see her lying in a
casket. A llie’s godm other was also afraid to view her.
Som eone suggested that seeing her in the casket
would give us a sense of closure. But somehow we
both got the strength.
Since A llie’s death, I have experienced every
heart-wrenching em otion known to man. I couldn’t
eat, sleep or think straight. I have constantly tried to
find fault in all of my actions. Maybe I didn’t warm
her bottles correctly, maybe I didn’t bundle her up
correctly, m aybe I didn’t hug and kiss her enoughmaybe...
A few days after A llie’s funeral, our family
received a SIDS packet from Illinois D epartm ent of
Public H ealth which addressed most of our fears and
concerns. Through reading the literature, we learned
that SIDS is not caused by suffocation, aspiration,
abuse, immunization, infections, allergies, rolling
over on the baby, pneum onia or freezing (not
enough covers).
SIDS occurs in families at all social and economic

levels. SIDS is not hereditary or contagious. Infants
betw een 2 and 4 m onths of age are m ost often the
victim of SIDS, but older and younger babies also
die of SIDS. SIDS occurs within seconds and the
infants do not suffer. Now, we find great peace of
mind knowing that Allie didn’t suffer and that she is
in heaven. T hat thought alone is what keeps me
going every morning, because 1 miss our child more
than anything in the world. I had so many dream s for
both of our daughters. I know the next day is not
prom ised for any of us, but after A llie’s death that
thought really rings in my ears.
W hen I returned to classes, some people were
sym pathetic, but there were a-handful of people that
were very insensitive. I refuse to repeat a com m ent
on, or give credence to an extrem ely insensitive
rem ark made by som eone on the bus after they
realized I was the m other of the three-and-a-halfweek-old infant that died. However, I will say that
after the rem ark all I could think was, “Boy, people
can be very cold.” B ut m ore than anything, I
co u ld n ’t believe th at som eone would let their
ignorance blind them on such a serious issue as
SIDS.
M ore than anything, I am subm itting this article
for parents, grandparents and day-care providers
who have walked into nurseries and found their once
beautiful and buoyant babies as lifeless dolls. O ur
grief is so trem endous that it can become blinding. I
didn’t think that I would see my way out, after A llie’s
death. But with the L o rd ’s help, I did.
A fter 30 years of research, scientists still cannot
find one definite cause, or causes, of SIDS. But good
prenatal care and breastfeeding also help reduce the

letter to the editor

Clinton is not the President he claims to be
O n Nov. 5, A m erica will have a very im portant
decision to m ake. Will we as a nation decide to
move in the direction of less governm ent and m ore
individual freedom , o r will we choose to move
towards m ore governm ental control? I would like
to take this opportunity to persuade the readers of
this paper to please vote for Bob Dole.
Bob D ole has a proven record of service to his
country. H e nearly sacrificed his life in World War
II and has served the public ever since. H e is a m an
of his w ord, not a politician m aking em pty
prom ises. B ob D ole understands th at the
individual, not federal bureaucracies, m ake this
country work. T hat is why he will cut our taxes by
15 percent and give families a $500 per child tax
credit. T here are many distortions, by the media,
about the consequences of the Dole proposal. Fact
is, every tim e tax rates have been cut in the past, tax
revenues increased. We often hear Bill Clinton
refer to deficit explosion while we know excessive
spending, and not tax cuts, cause large federal
deficits.
T he o th er m ajor presidential candidate, Bill
Clinton, has prom ised us m iddle class tax relief and
has never delivered. Clinton constantly brags about

how great the economy is, as if he m akes this
country work. It astonishes me how the m edia does
not report that unem ploym ent was already falling
before Clinton came into office. People seem to feel
that Bill Clinton has turned this economy around.
He hasn’t. O ur economy had already been out of
recession for 8 quarters before he came into office.
My point is that President Clinton is taking credit
for a lot of good things he has not created.
C linton also takes credit for reducing the deficit
from around $250 billion to the 1996 estim ate of
$117 billion. T here is no way this would have
h appened w ithout a R epublican Congress. In
February of 1993, Clinton proposed an “economic
stim ulus” package th at was rejected by a
D em ocratic
C ongress
as
too
“fiscally
irresponsible”. In Septem ber of 1993, President
C linton lobbied to defeat the bipartisan, PennyKasich, deficit reduction bill which would have
decreased the deficit by $90 billion over five years.
In January of 1994, Clinton proposed “Clinton
C are” which would have added at least $75 billion
to the deficit over the next six years, according to
the Congressional Budget Office.

C linton has m ade o th e r social program
proposals, such as his crime bill which included
federally funded dance classes, sensitivity training
courses and the ultim ate crime stopper, midnight
basketball leagues.
Even liberal rep o rter David B roder blasted the
various proposals by calling them a “symbol of
Clinton’s failed leadership”.
Clinton is not the president he claims to be. He
has a very liberal record and does not believe the
“era of big governm ent is over” as he claimed in his
State of the U nion address earlier this year. His
bridge into the twenty-first century is nothing m ore
than a vast array of new governm ent program s, and
quite frankly, I do not want to pay that toll. Please
vote for Bob D ole on Nov. 5. H e represents the
A m erican ideal of less taxes and less governm ental
intrusion into our lives.
“We should cut middle-class taxes im mediately
by 10 percent.”

A utom atic
deposits
save time
By D anette Watt
A ssistant News Editor
Electronic Fund Transfers
aren ’t a new concept, but it’s
f i n a l l y c a t c h i n g on.
Kim Thom as, payroll clerk
for student em ployees, said
the n um ber of students
enrolling in the autom atic
deposit program is growing.
“W e’ve had ab out 20
people enroll just from the
last payroll. O f 1,100 student
em ployees, about 200 are in
the program ,” Thom as said.
T hom as attrib u tes the
increase to b etter advertising.
She also said the response
from university em ployees is
b e tte r because they are
offered the chance to join the
program when they are hired.
W hen em ployees sign up
for EFT, th eir paycheck is
autom atically d ep osited in
th e bank of th eir choice,
saving them from having to
stand in line at the B ursar’s
office, or in a bank, to deposit it.
To join the E FT program,
students need to bring in a
blank deposit slip to the payroll
office in R endlem an (Rm
0224). If students can get it in
before Wednesday noon, their
Dec. 5 check will be at their
bank.
Thomas said students need
to notify payroll of any changes
to their account so there is no
delay in getting their check.

Modern day Shakespeare: hit and miss
By Greg Levrault
For the A lestle
A sign of intelligence to which m ost
people aspire is the ability to appreciate
Shakespeare. A n easy way to impress
intellectuals at parties is to talk about
the symbolism and subtext of any
of the B ard ’s works.
I t ’s
no t
right,
because
Shakespeare was the Tarantino
of his time, hiding high ideals
about hum anity in cheesy soap
operas and gory thrills.
S h ak esp eare’s poetry raised
his
plays
above
cheap
am usem ent and gave his stories
the popularity they now enjoy.
Director Baz Luhrmann tries to
show this in his experiment, “William
Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet”.
L u h rm an n
m ust
love
Shakespeare’s language, because
he bends over backwards to keep
the original text, and m ake it
co m prehensible to the M TV
g en eratio n.
He
sneaks
S h ak esp eare
qu o tes
into
billboard ads and bathroom graffitti.
A nd every “th ee” and “betw ixt” has
b een p reserv ed , pouring ou t of the
m ouths of gangbangers and
swatteam members.
“R + J” is Shakespeare with car chases,
gunfire, techno music and video editing.
The new R om eo and Juliet are the

children of rival m ob families in Verona
Beach, U SA , who happen to m eet and
fall in love in one night. They m arry the
next day. H ours later, Rom eo kills one of
Juliet’s gun-toting cousins, and hides out
in a trailer park.
The
story
is
p re tty
m uch

Shakespeare’s, but with a m odern setting
and speed. “ R + J” has its share of
problems. Some of the soliloquies and
speeches have been reduced to snippets
or visual gimmicks. Several of the actors,
particularly the younger ones, spout
their lines so frantically they d o n ’t seem
to even know what they’re saying. The

script has all of the original dialogue,
m aking it som etim es difficult to catch
every detail.
Today’s television-suckled audience
knows
S hak esp eare
as
a
class
requirem ent, not a writer. Few think of
how m any bodies pile up in a
S hak esp eare
playFew
appreciate the broad com edy he
threw in. Few people know he
wrote dirty jokes. “ R +J” shows
those strengths.
The “R + J” cast is strong. Some
of the younger actors seem to
scream m ore than act, while the
older cast m em bers speak the
B ard ’s lines m ore com fortably
and convincingly.
Pete Postelwaithe (The
U sual Suspects) as F ath er
Law rence, R o m eo ’s m entor,
deserves an O scar nom ination,
he m akes the lines lucid and
natu ral. L eo n ard o D icaprio
excels in the role he was born to
play. D iC aprio’s R om eo shows
all th e
aw kw ardness and
nobility,
the
hope
and
hopelessness th at is teenage
love. T here’s a sincerity and innocence in
his passion. By com parison, C laire
D anes’ Juliet was pretty shallow.
“R + J” turns the quaint play from four
centuries ago into a m o d ern ro ller­
coaster ride. W ith any luck, it should get
the
cable-ready
public
to
give
Shakespeare a second look.

Playoff hopes
doused with
GLVC losses
By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor

Todd Spann/Alestle

SIUE Bowl IV
Super Sunday lived up to it’s
nam e as the defending champion
Young Guns slipped by their arch
rivals, the Playboys 13 to 7 in SIU E
Bowl IV. A fter a quick 7-0 lead, the
Playboys failed to reach the endzone
again and watched Bill Ram sey throw
for a score and run for another. The
Young Guns have won their second
title in two years. They now have their
sights set on New Orleans as they will
represent the SIU E Intram ural p ro ­
gram in the National Flag Football
Todd Spann/A/esf/e

Tournam ent in Decem ber.

The hope for a playoff birth was doused for the
SIU E m en’s soccer team when they lost to both
Lewis and W isconsin-Parkside in conference action
last weekend.
The G reat Lakes Valley C onference’s first place
team , Lewis, defeated the Cougars 3-0 on Saturday,
in Romeoville, 111.
Lewis had an obvious size advantage which
added to their powerful offensive attack.
“They beat us on the restarts,” head coach Ed
H uneke said. “They had great execution in putting
the ball back into play. Their corner kicks were very
effective.”
S IU E continued to struggle against WisconsinParkside in Kenosha, Wis. The Cougars fell to the
No. 2 team in the conference 3-0.
W isconsin-Parkside did their dam age in a span
of eight minutes. T heir three goals came between
the 30th m inute and the 38th minute.
“We played poor soccer for 15 m inutes of the
game and they took advantage with three goals,”
H uneke said. “We played well the rest of the game,
but it just shows that against good team s you can’t
have a let down.”
The losses had an effect on S IU E ’s GLVC tour­
nam ent schedule too. The Cougars will open up the
tournam ent on W ednesday against Quincy on the
road. SIU E will be trying to avenge a loss handed
to them by Quincy earlier in the season.
“This game is much m ore meaningful than our
first game against them ,” H uneke said. “It has all
the ingredients for a great match-up. We’ve had an
intense rivalry with Quincy, so both team s should
be ready to play.”

Volleyball splits conference Going national
matches over the weekend

Women’s soccer gets the call fo r tournament

By Brett Licata
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E volleyball team split their two
G reat Lakes Valley C onference m atches
last weekend.
The first place team in the Blue Division of
the GLVC gave the Cougars a tough time on
Friday. IU PU -Ft. Wayne defeated SIU E 15-1,
15-7,15-3.
“The six hour ride didn’t help us at all,”
head coach Sandy M ontgom ery said. “This is as
bad as we have played all year.”
The second conference game was against
the last place team in the Blue Division,
St. Joseph’s.
The Cougars had an easy time disposing of
St. Jo sep h ’s 15-4, 14-16, 15-4, 16-14 in
R enesselaer, Ind. on Saturday.
“We didn’t play as sharp as we could have,”
M ontgom ery said. “We needed this m atch to

get the kinks out, and gear up for our last three
regular season contests.”
S IU E will face a tough o pponent in
W ashington U niversity tonight at the
V adalabene C enter at 7 p.m. WU has won the
Division III National Cham pionship the past
five years.
“This should be a good m atch-up,”
M ontgom ery said. “I hope that we can get
some breaks and play our game. Playing in our
building should help us a lot. We play better
when we have the fan support.”
The Cougars will finish their regular season
at the V adalabene C enter this weekend against
W isconsin-Parkside on Friday at 7:30 p.m., and
Lewis on Saturday at 2 p.m.
“I t’s very im portant that we win these con­
ference matches,” M ontgom ery said. “We have
a good chance to win both games. Beating
these team s would help us prepare for the
conference tournam ent.”

By Todd Spann
Sports Editor
The bid is in.
A t 1 o’clock yesterday after­
noon, the SIUE women’s soccer
team heard from the NCAA that
they were selected to the 1996
national playoffs.
The Cougars, 16-3-2, had to
win their last two regular sea­
son games in the University of
M issouri-St. L ouis to u rn a ­
m ent to give them selves a shot
at being invited to the N C A A
tournam ent.
The Cougars beat Ashland
in the first game of the UM SL
tournam ent 6-1 and then got
by W heeling-Jesuit 3-1 in the
second game.
“Things fell o ur way this'

weekend. Five team s were in
the h u n t and D rury lost,
Trum an State tied, and UM SL
got upset by A shland,” head
coach B rian K orbesm eyer
said.
St. Joseph’s and SIU E were
the two team s th at m ade the
tournam ent out of the five still
looking for a bid.
The Cougars will play their
GLVC foe, St. Joseph’s, in the
first round of the tournam ent
on Sunday in R enesselaer,
Ind. at 1 P.M.
St. Joseph’s record is 21-1-1.
“We respect them but we
d o n ’t hold them in awe,”
K orbesm eyer said.
The Cougars will have a
chance to redeem themselves
from an earlier 3-1 lose to St.
Joseph’s.
