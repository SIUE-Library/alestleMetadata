New program set to
help international
students in English
By Darryl Howlett
News Editor
Some help will be coming to international students this
fall. The new Intensive English Program (IEP) has been set
up at SIUE to raise scopes in English.
The program offers non-credit English language study
for international students with TO EFL (Test Of English as
a Foreign Language) scores between 490 and 549 who have
gained pre-admission approval to the university.
Michelle Estaque, who developed and will instruct the
courses, is looking forward to starting the program.
“Many universities have this type of program. Hopefully
it will increase the number of international students,”
Estaque said. “In the past the university had to turn away
students because of low scores. I’ve worked at SLU (Saint
Louis University), Wash U. (Washington University, St.
Louis) and they’ve all got their programs.”
Estaque’s work to inform the university about the new
program has been fast paced. Along with flyers on bulletin
boards around campus, she has sent memos to
administrators and faculty. Estaque has a primary goal for
the first year.
“I would like to see improvement in test scores. I would
like for them (students) to become good students in a
western style university,” Estaque said.
IEP classes are devoted to reading, writing,
listening/speaking, grammar and the language laboratory.
Each class will meet four hours per week. IEP students will
receive 16 hours of classroom instruction per week plus
four hours of supervised lab experience.
The program will also focus on creating a better
atmosphere for international students to learn more about
the culture and society in America and the local area.
“We will be going on field trips to places in the area. I
will also encourage the students to interact as much as
possible with American students and would hope that
American students would do the same,” Estaque said.
Estaque said the thrill of starting a new program is great.
“I’m really looking forward to this,” Estaque said.
The program includes a single semester tuition cost of
$2,100. Individuals in the program can also apply for oncampus housing.

Two more fires hit churches
ROCKY POINT, N.C. — Early
morning fires destroyed a rural black church in Rocky Point Monday
and heavily damaged the former sanctuary of a mostly white
congregation in Georgia.
State and federal investigators brought in specialists and a trained
dog to determine whether the blaze at Hills Chapel Baptist Church
was arson.
The Hills Chapel Fire began about 1:20 a.m. Flames destroyed
most of the building, leaving only parts of two side walls upright and
leveling a dining hall. It was almost noon before embers cooled
enough to let investigators begin picking through shovelfuls of ash.

Accused serial killer denies mass slayings
SYDNEY- Australia — An accused serial killer testified Monday
that he had nothing to do with the deaths of seven backpackers
whose bodies were found in a remote Australian forest between 1989
and 1992.
As relatives of the victims watched intently, Ivan Milat calmly
answered questions from his defense lawyer that were meant to cast
doubt on the prosecutor’s case.
The 51-year-old road construction worker told the New South
Wales Supreme Court that he did not kill any of the backpackers and
had no knowledge of the crimes.

commentary

Women should be judged on their ability not their dress size
P o in t o f V ie w

Danette W att
Some information came across the news desk
earlier this week that I thought was part of the past
by now. Contestants are being sought for the 1996
Miss Illinois Teen All-American Pageant.
“All judging is on the basis of poise, personal
interview and beauty of face and figure.” Applicants
couldn’t have been married (but can they have kids,
I wonder?).
Spare me. Why are girls and women still being
judged on the basis of their looks and charm? You
don’t see contests for men based on their looks and
“charms.”
(Well, I suppose there might be something like a
“wet shorts” contest in a bar but that’s a whole other
issue.)
The usual excuses and reasons given are that it’s a
good opportunity for girls to earn a scholarship or
other prizes. In fact, the winners of this contest will
compete for a prize package that includes a
“Personal appearance £GBtf2£t^ cash, jewelry,
luggage and more!!!”
Winners also get to be interviewed by
representatives from the TV/film industry and
modeling agencies. Many past winners “have signed
with major agencies and enjoy careers as TV and
film stars, international models and spokespeople.”
Let’s take this point by point.
First, about the poise. Isn’t poise just a way of
handling yourself in tough situations? Is this another
way to say “leadership qualities?” Then maybe we
should be thinking of other ways to give girls the

opportunity to be in leadership roles and to learn
those skills. Everyone needs to learn to handle
themselves with the public, males and females.
Ditto to the personal interview. If girls are given
more opportunities to develop confidence in
themselves and how they act upon the world, they
can handle the personal interview.
And what do they ask, “What is your favorite rock
star?” Or hopefully, more like “What are your goals
and how do you plan to get there?”
I find it very insulting for females to be judged on
their looks in a competition against other females.
This kind of nonsense doesn’t need to be encouraged
any more than it already is.
Today, girls as young as fourth grade are obsessed
with their weight and being “too fat.” These are
children whose bodies are still growing. Yet, with our
pervasive “you can never be too thin” attitude, these
girls are in real danger of going too far and crossing
over into developing serious eating disorders.
These contests also do little else but reinforce a
competition between women that foster a “one up”
feeling. How many women reading this constantly
measure themselves against other women in terms of
looks? Body image is a serious problem among
women and often women’s feelings of self-worth
depend on a few pounds.
Instead of fostering competition between women,
we should be cOSeerSSd about fostering cooperation
and cohesiveness so we can address the I *—
clI
important issues at hand: health care, child care and
job security. When women feel they are divided by
their looks, they have little energy to come together
to make their voices heard on other matters.
One excuse (or reason) often given to hold these
contests is for “the scholarship.” Well, if this is about
scholarly ability, why isn’t this a quiz show? Perhaps
we need to be looking at the broader spectrum and

letter to the editor ------------------------

Aide voices concerns over Madison
County Transit situation
better understanding and broader support for
A few things about the June 12th front-page
story on the proposed agreement between
SIUE and MCT concern me. First, answering a
question as to why those who would be
affected by the proposal were not involved in
its development, Vice Chancellor Neher said
that during negotiations between labor and
management, “it was inappropriate for the
union to involve student government.” He also
cited the “complex set of laws...and regulations
that prohibit informing the customer during
negotiations.”

The

point

is

that

the

administration should have involved the
students before deciding on the proposal and
before it began negotiations with the union. I
am very much in favor of mass transit and

this proposal.
Secondly, I am more concerned about the
communications “breakdown” and less about
who finally “leaked” information to the
students.
Apparently,
disseminating
information is classified as either “sharing” or
“leaking” depending on one’s point of view.
Finally, I hope this situation is not an
indication of more things to come. No one
benefits from a “divide and conquer” strategy
that blames unions whenever there is negative
publicity. To focus on the messenger instead of
the message doesn’t speak well of
adm inistrators

reconsidering the opportunities we give to girls so
they can excel in other ways and get that scholarship
money without having to depend on their looks.
And notice who the state winners get to talk to
about careers. It doesn’t have anything to do with
using their brains. I don’t mean to imply that being
an actress or model is a walk in the park. But let’s
face it, success in those careers depends largely on
looks.
W hat’s really sad is that these contests start with
the “Most Beauiiiui Baby” COHtest: All babies are
beautiful and every parent has the brightest, cutest
and funniest baby.
There isn’t anything inherently wrong with
wanting to be pretty and appreciated for that. But
when so much emphasis is placed on looks, to the
exclusion of skills, talent and brains, it only hurts girls
in the long run.

The phone fraud saga
continues as the University
Police conduct interviews with
the last few dozen of the 1,045
people who turned themselves
in for amnesty February 29.
Chancellor Nancy Belck
said in an interview last
Wednesday that the police
will be collecting suspects of
phone fraud for questioning
and prosecution as soon as the
last of the students under
amnesty
have
been
interviewed.

“The police have a list of
possible phone fraud suspects
and some will be obtained
through
the
amnesty
interviews, Belck said.
Belck also said that in some
cases, bringing students in for
prosecution could become
challenging due to the fact
that some of the students are
in other countries or have
graduated from SIUE.
However, the university
does intend to pay back as
much of the money as they
can, and will not pay for any
of the debt with state funds,
Belck added.

Moses shares teachings with
SIUE, Edward svi Ile community
By Ty Norris
News Reporter
Johnny Moses, of the Nootka and Spokane
tribes, shared teachings of the Si-Sf-Wiss
tradition of the Pacific Northwest on Saturday
June 15. The gathering was open to the SIUE
community and the Edwardsville community.
The event was held at the Religious Center
and included a potluck supper.
An oral I v o r ia n , respected spiritual leader
and practitioner of native healing ways, Moses
spoke about the traditions that were passed
down to him. He was raised until age nine by
his maternal grandparents, who first began to
train him in northern Nootka and Saanich
traditions.
“I feel I have been called to do this,” Moses
said. “Since 1976, I have been traveling and
educating people about the culture.”
“It is important to learn ancient ways and
teachings,” he added.
Si-Si-Wiss means “sacred breath” and the
ceremony includes a medicine circle. The
medicine circle includes four vital elements. A
bowl of water is placed in the circle and
regarded sacred because it keeps us alive.
There are candles in the circle as well that
represent the light of understanding. The
Earth is symbolized by a rock or plant and
finally pure air, which is symbolic of the sacred
breath.

for
the
amount that the university
cannot come up with to pay
the debt.
One of the consequences
that the university may face

“In a medicine circle people gather to bring
out songs, stories and perform medicine
dances,” Greg Fields, assistant professor of
philosophy, said.
“In our open circle we welcome songs from
Indian nations and all religions and
denominations,” Fields said. “We put aside all
our differences that would prevent »5 from
working to g ^^ g - We dance in celebration of
life,” he added.
TRIBE and the American Indian Science
and Engineering Society were two SIUE
organizations that were involved in the
gathering. The organizations prom ote the
advancem ent and equality of Native
Americans.
“TR IB E is a Native American support
group that educates people on the traditions,”
Julie Armbruster, president of TRIBE, said.
“We promote the advancement of Native
Americans in the sciences,” Shane Cochran,
president of the American Indian Science and
Engineering Society, said.
“Education and healing were the reasons
we wanted Johnny Moses to come and speak
here,” Armbruster and Cochran both said.
The event was sponsored by TRIBE, SIUE
Native American Student Association, United
Christian Foundation and the Red Cedar
Circle.
“I’ve had a wonderful time, the people have
been very nice to me,” Moses said.

"The Cable Guy": not just another Carrey comedy

w en Steven ta es his friend s advice, he

disconnected from the real world. He tries to break
off the friendship, but Chip won't have any of that.
So Chip gets Steven thrown in jail and even gets
Steven's own family to turn against him.
It's hard to watch Carrey not be Ace Ventura, but
he's still just as funny as the cable guy. Through a
crazy nightmare of an evil cable guy, a real-life
porno "Password" game and an ending that leaves
an opening for a part two, 'The Cable Guy" is a
riot.
At a deeper level though, the film's message is
realistic and relevant to today's society. On the
superficial level, it's about a warped isolate who has
never experienced any familial warmth. His mother
is always gone and he is left at home two feet away
from the television. Essentially, the only warmth Chip
ever does experience is that coming from the top of
the television since it's on all of the time.
Throughout the movie are excerpts of an ongoing,
sensationalized murder trial (much like that of O J.
Simpson) that no viewer dares to miss. Just when the
verdict is about to be read, the entire city's cable
goes out. The viewers are, well, they're at a loss,

For all the now grown-up kids who grew up on
"The Brady Bunch," "M y Three Sons" and
"Bewitched," it's time to get unstuck from the boob
tube and get to the movie theater. Jim Carrey as "The
Cable Guy" has a message for you.
Carrey stars as a demented cable installer in this
hilarious, satiric film directed by Ben Stiller. And the
message lies within Carrey and his cooky character.
The message? Well, it's not on how to get free cable.
Instead, it's more of a satiric message on what can
happen to those nurtured by cable television and
don't think there's anything more to life than the one
shown on television.
Carrey plays Chip Douglas (a name taken from
"My Three Sons") who doesn't really have a name of
his own. He calls himself Chip, Larry Tate
("Bewitched") and even Ricky Ricardo ("I Love Lucy").
Chip is a lonely kid raised on cable television. This
lonely kid grows up to be a lonely and demented
adult who installs cable. But this is where the tun

century London. Other characters by Dickens, such as the Artful Dodger, Fagin and Mr.

of the Communications Building. Pre-show performances, including an authentic "Punch-nJudy" puppet show will be held in the lobby starting at 7:00.
The show will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will run Thursday through Sunday, June 20-23 and

SIUE sports camps off and running

Photos by Todd Spann/Alestle

The SIUE sports department has started sports camps for the Children between the ages of seven and 18. Women’s basketball and
softball finished a series of camps for youngsters last week. Track and Field started a speed and flexibility camp this week and
baseball did the same f(ff advanced students of the game.

and delivers an RBI single. If that wasn’t enough by
the Cardinal outfielder, he again got up to bat in the

slam.
I was sitting by two Cub fans, mind you, and after
Willie hit that homerun, even they stood up and
cheered with all 27, 000 plus in the ballpark until
Willie gave us a curtain call. That was two pitches
into the next batter.
I will never forget that moment in my life. That
was the best game I have been to and I will be able
to tell my children I saw Willie play.
