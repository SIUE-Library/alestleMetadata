Emergency phones added

Help will soon be just a

of the SIUE campus.
Students may have noticed

many of the tall, brown
emergency phone stanchions
being erected in Cougar Village
and in several parking lots. More

be placed on portions of the bike

“It’s not an issue of more

Buzz, buzz - wasps in the books at Lovejoy
BY SASHA MASTROIANNI
NEWS STRINGER

Jill S le \e n s/A le stle

A new emergency phone in parking lot E.

The Lovejoy Library is
being invaded. Dead bodies can
be seen scattered about on the
second and third floors.
At least 20 carcasses were on
the carpet in one area of the third
floor Monday. O thers were
resting quietly inside the plastic
lighting cover.
Still, there are survivors.
-Some were flitting back and
forth, trying to propel their weak
bodies off the carpet.

Although it may sound like a
scene out of an old horror film,
it’s not. This is the time of year
when pests move indoors to find
shelter from the worsening
weather. Wasps, lady bugs, ants
and flies are seen inside buildings
when the weather cools off.
Here at SIUE, wasps are
gaining access to the library by
slipping through cracks.
In some places, large groups
of them can be found. Lighting
and windows seem to be their
favorite hangouts.

Student directed play “Pterodactyls” to open this Thursday at Metcalf
BY LISA GULICK
NF.WS STRINGER
“Pterodactyls,”
a
play
written by Nicky Silver, will
make its debut Thursday through
Sunday at the James F. Metcalt
Theater.

“It is an absurdist dark
comedy,” director Bryan Miller
said. The play deals with
marriage, AIDS, fear, the demise
of a family and, mainly, denial.
“We are hoping to have a
good response,” M iller said. He,
along with the cast and the crew

have been working on the play
for approximately six weeks. The
play has been advertised on
“Show Me St. Louis” and fliers
have been distributed. Miller said
he is very excited about the
debut.
M iller is a senior theater

major at SIUE. Miller chose to
direct “Pterodactyls” because he
wanted to direct a play by Silver
and admired the directing style of
the original production. This will
be the first play M iller has
directed.
“It was something I wanted

to do for an accomplishment and
for the experience,” Miller said.
M iller had to generate a
budget, publicity and a staff, then
present the entire concept to the
Student Experim ental Theater
Organization.

The pesky critters seem to
make it into the building and

“It’s a seasonal thing,”

Chemistry major Terri Haas
was aware of the winged invaders.
“One time they flew by my
head. I got up and moved and I
tried to be quiet,” she said. “I’ve
only seen them once.”
Mike Riether, a psychology
major who visits the library a few
times a week, wasn’t aware of the
problem.
“Definitely that would keep
me away. I hate wasps. I’m scared
to death of being stung by them,”
Riether said.
Another student expressed
little concern.
“I was aware of the wasps,”

electrical engineering student
Makin Hamzah said. “It didn’t
bother me so much. I was getting

Hamzah said he studies on
the third floor because it is usually
quiet “until they were buzzing on
the glass. Then I killed two of
them,” Hamzah said.
Some students didn’t seem to
be as aware of their surroundings.
“I haven’t noticed it yet,”
mass communications major
Tynisha Jones said. Jones was
searching for books on the first
floor, where there has been little
evidence of the invaders.
Pest control representatives
in the area said that without
knowing the type of wasp and
where they are nesting, it’s hard to
know when they will leave the
library.
In the meantime, students
should be aware o f their
surroundings and they may want
to carry fly swatters.

other services as required.
If someone feels threatened
or is in im m ediate danger,
pressing the emergency button
will contact university police, but
also the stanchion will produce
sirens, whistles and other noises.
University Police Lt. Regina
Hays said that in this situation,
the closest officer will be
dispatched
immediately.
Depending on the locations of the
phone and the officer, response
time can be anywhere from a few

seconds to a minute.
Vanzo said that SIUE was
one of the first institutions to
install emergency phones.
“People are o f two opinions
about having emergency phones
on a campus,” Vanzo said. One
group thinks “the phones are an
indication of a bad or dangerous
campus. Others feel that having
the phones shows a commitment
to protecting the students on that
campus. The phones at SIUE
have been very well accepted.”

Letter to the Editor
Election column was
right on target
To Ms. Belton: Great
election editorial, particularly the
paragraph near the end where you
say that “young people are
flighty.” You are exactly right.
W hen I went to W estern
M ichigan University
as a
freshman in 1983, my father told
me that “by the end o f your
freshman year, you should come
home espousing communism and
socialism as the best political
system s; by the end o f your
sophom ore year, you should
embrace capitalism only; by your
junior year, existentialism; and
by graduation, be a believer in
democracy.”
He was only a little sarcastic
(being a totally liberal college
professor himself, it wasn’t until I
was 30 years old before I could
understand his lexicon), but his
point was that our education
needs to be all-encompassing,
widely diverse and challenging.
All college should really do
is provide us a foundation from
which to continue self-study and
education. My own view is that
we need to read a lot (time) and
we need to read a lot (diverse
topics) Good luck, keep fighting
the good fight.

Belton for about two years now.

hardworking, intelligent, kind,

Danielle is handling the

Students are voting
To vote or not to vote? That
is a good question. According to
my own random poll of SIUE
students, out o f 32 students
questioned, 21 did not vote in the
recent election. However, 11 of
the 32 students did. Plus, most of
the students who confessed that
they did not vote are first-year
students here. They pointed out
that they were still registered to
vote in their hometowns but not
in Edwardsville.
A significant num ber of
college students, while they may
not be in the majority, do vote. It
is an atrocity to this generation of
new voters to proclaim that none
of the citizens attending SIUE
vote.
As a junior in the M ass
Communications Department, I
am insulted! I w ould like to
represent those college students
who are not “flighty” or “selfabsorbed,” as a recent Alestle
column said. I take great pride in

the ability to have a choice
regarding who will lead my
nation and my life.
On Tuesday, Nov. 3, I drove
to the polls and eagerly voted. I
then attended a political victory
party that evening. I had
researched each candidate and
their positions on the issues for
this election. I cannot allow this
degrading opinion o f all college
students to go unchallenged!
More than two decades ago,
many 18-year-olds demanded the
privilege to choose who would
decide to send their fathers,
brothers, family and friends into
the Vietnam War. These young
adults proclaimed, “If we are old
enough to go to war, then we are
old enough to vote,” according to
Colleen Ashbaker, age 41.
I realize that many students
on this campus and others do not
vote. But many others like myself
do. Let’s not be forgotten. I w on’t
stand by and be generalized or
grouped into a false category of
nonvoters.
As a student and an
enthusiast of politics, I have
interviewed many politicians and
political candidates who have, in
fact, shown an interest in my
well-being and opinions. Frank
W atson, Illinois state senator,
scheduled time to talk with me
within one day of my call to him.
I often rely on Jack Lampen,
Clinton County Board member,
to keep me up to date on the
county’s affairs, not only for
classes, but also as a taxpayer
who would like to stay informed.
Also, I have an appointment with
my city’s mayor to discuss a city
ordinance that has recently been
amended.
I am hardly uninvolved in or
ignored by my governm ent
officials. It is true that some of
my fellow students do need to
realize that our governm ent
affects all of us in many aspects.
Instead of condoning this lack of
interest and demeaning the young
adults of this campus, we, the
voters, should do something to
change it.

My recent column about hair apparently confused
MLa few people. I wrote about something painful and
t t g P V f l personal. I didn’t want my hair to get any more attention
than it already does, but 1 wanted people to understand
Danielle *10W suPer*'c' a' beauty standards are in our society.
Belton
A lot of what I wrote was sarcasm about society
and criticism of myself. I do not like the fact that
something as little as hair means so much to me, but a lot o f women
must have the same problem because the hair care industry is a
multibillion-dollar business.
Some people, many people for that matter, are infatuated with
hair. Besides signifying what passes for beauty in some circles, hair
also has various cultural significances.
Most of us, particularly the women, remember the girl in high
school with the perfect hair. A head full of shiny, perfect blonde hair
that bounced when she walked and was soft when she curled it
around her little finger. She was what thousands o f television ads
and magazines covers told us women should want to be. She was
Loni Anderson, Marsha Brady, Melanie Griffith, Marilyn Monroe
and Meg Ryan. Madonna even named a tour after her bleached tress.
Of course, that perfect hair did not just happen. You had to have
money to buy the best shampoos and money to get it styled and cut
by professionals. Some of it may be natural, but a lot of it was
maintenance. Even Marsha Brady was shown brushing her hair a
hundred times before she went to bed at night.
Why, why, why?
Why do women wear hats when they have bad hair days? Why
do commercials say foolish things like, “To get control of your life,
you have to get control of your hair”? (For the more dreaded version
of that, replace “life” with “man.”) Women live in a “Maybe she’s
born with it, maybe it’s Maybelline" world where beauty can be
bought at Walgreens for $4.95 and surgically enhanced for a few
thousand more.
Trying to fit in can be a dehumanizing and tedious experience.
If I want my hair to bounce in the breeze like the American hair
archetype, I have to spend $55 and seven hours at the hair dresser.
With all the hair supplies I own including curling irons and blow
dryers, my head o f hair is worth more than $100. There are days
when I would just rather be bald. But then I’d risk being treated like
a freak. Did you ever notice how people react to bald women?
People are frightened o f them. They think such women have cancer
or some contagious disease. They never think maybe that woman got
tired of spending more than $ 1,000 or more a year on her hair.
Men sometimes can’t hide from the hair fetish. Men do go bald:
black men just shave it all off and white men comb it over till they
can’t comb it over any more. Some bald men accept their baldness
and could care less what others think; other men hold on to their hair,
or what’s left of it, for dear life.
The difference is, bald or not, men are still accepted. Baldness
is seen as just a part o f aging with men. With women, it is seen as
abnormal along with having frizzy hair, overly curly hair or limp,
thin hair.
A current television commercial (arid I’m pretty sure it’s trying
to sell shampoo) features a tall, very pretty blonde woman strutting
down the street and swinging her hair to the Isley Brothers’ hit,
“W ho’s That Lady.” Everyone from firemen to dogs stare at her,
singing the chorus as she goes past.
I find the ad disturbing, and not because a toy dog is singing an
Isley Brothers classic. Here is a woman and all she is a head of hair.
All anyone cares about is the hair in that commercial. And what does
that say?
It starts with your hair, then your weight and then every part of
a woman’s anatomy is up for sale.
Beauty for sale - you too can have a piece o f the American
dream, and it’s just a good cream rinse and a hair rclaxer away.

BY A N TO IN ETTE BERNICH
LIFESTYLE STRINGER
Somewhere between body piercing and
normality lies som eone who compliments both
worlds.
Jennifer Nicole Ball reaches both worlds in
her own unique way. Ball, a 21-year-old
freshman at SIUE. did not have to think twice
about getting her tongue or navel pierced. To
her, that symbolized her youth and freedom. It
was a way of making herself unique from
everyone else.
In addition to the piercings, Ball has two
tattoos. On her lower back is a purple and black
circular printer’s mark she found in a book.
“I liked the way it looked,” Ball said. The
other tattoo, a tribal symbol o f serenity, is
around her bellybutton.
Ball is not all tattoos and body piercings,
however. She graduated from Addison Trail
High School, which lies outside of Chicago, in
1995 and decided to join the military. Her father,
Thomas, was in the A ir Force years before Ball
was bom, but that did not influence her decision
to join the Army.
“I chose the m ilitary because I knew
eventually I would be going to college and the
Army would pay for a lot of my tuition if I
joined. My dad was ju st really happy that I
decided to go into the service,” Ball said. She is
currently signed up for four years of National
Guard duty.

S T IC K M A N

A l e s t l e

T uesday, N ovem ber

10, 1998 ♦

Ball was stationed in Fort Richardson,
Alaska for ^vo years. Her greatest
accomplishment is graduating from basic
training because ‘'a lot of people I started with
didn’t finish. It made me feel great that I could
survive something that was so physically
demanding.”
Another of Ball’s accomplishments is
helping to build a cultural center on Kwajalein
Island in the Marshall Islands. “We built it from
the ground up. I used my own two hands. It was
amazing to see pictures of the center as we were
building it and then see the finished project
because I knew I was a part of it. I built it.”
Ball’s college career started when she got
out of the Army. She is currently interested in
nursing because she wants to help people and
“get away from the monotony o f doing the same
thing every day.”
Eventually, Ball wants to get married and
have two children — a boy and a girl. But for
right now, she is content with school and “doing
fun things while I am still young enough to do
them .”
These fun things include sky diving, scuba
diving and plenty of soccer. Ball describes
herself as sarcastic, funny and sincere. “But I am
too quiet when I come into a new situation. That
is probably the only thing that I would want to
change about myself.”
“I want to be happy and successful in all
that I try to accomplish.” Ball said. “So far, I
have not let myself down.”

ADAM HANDLER DOES IT AGAIN
BY SHERI M cW HIRTER
LIFESTYLE EDITOR
Bobby Boucher, played by
Adam Sandler, is a socially
inept 31-year-old from the
swamps of Louisiana. He is
home-schooled and sheltered
by his overprotective Mama,
played by Kathy Bates. His
only contact with society
comes from his job as a water
boy for a college team where
the players relentlessly make
fun of him and his coach
doesn’t let him fight back.
This all changes when
Bobby gets a new coach,
played by Henry Winkler, who
lets him stand up for himself.
Bobby finally unleashes years
of pent-up rage and is
transform ed into the most
devastating tackier on the team.
Now Bobby has to learn how to
play football and go to college,
all behind Mama’s back.
The
movie
opens
by
introducing the audience to
Bobby Boucher, the slow and
stuttering water boy that only
M other Teresa w ouldn’t have
laughed at.
Unfortunately, the audience
can predict every event in

gets from the original football
team, and later from the second
football team he works for, the
audience is either laughing
hysterically or trying not to cry
because they feel incredibly sorry
for the poor sap.

Boucher falls in love with
the frightening Vicki Vallencourt,
played by Fairuza Balk, despite
M ama’s orders not to associate
with girls because “they the
devil.” The series of episodes
with Vicki also keeps the
audience rolling.
All in all, the movie is
incredibly
predictable
but
insanely funny. Adam Sandler
managed to do it again. “The
Waterboy” definitely lives up to
the
standards
of
“Happy
Gilmore,” “Billy M adison” and
“The Wedding Singer.”

SOME SECRETS WILL HAUNT YOU FOREVER

“My music collection
because it keeps me
company on those lonely
nights.”
-Tom Plunk,
Sophomore, Art

“My Mark McGuire
rookie card because I’m
a fan and it’s worth
some dough now.”
-Travis Volz,
Senior, Mass
Communications

“My CDs because I can’t
live without my music.”
-Keke Walker,
Sophomore, MIS

Som eone
is dying for
a secoli'
chance

“My library of reference
books because they are
largely responsible for
who I am today.”
-Alesia Dugan,
Senior,
Anthropology/History
