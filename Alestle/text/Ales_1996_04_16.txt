“ My purpose is to cut down on the num ber of lives

from gun violence,” B rady said.
B rady suppo rts legislation enacting waiting periods
and registration policies for gun ow nership. However,

think th ere are things we can do to save lives,” Brady
said.

Creationism vs. Evolution: Teachers should
teach both and let the students decide
There has been a recent resurgence of debate betw een the Biblical-based
theory of creationism and Charles D arw in’s theory of evolution. In Tennessee,
the state in which the famous Scopes M onkey Trial took place 71 years ago, the
State Senate is considering a bill which will allow a teacher to be fired for
presenting evolution as fact. Also, R epublican presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan brought up the issue of teaching evolution by remarking, “I think
(parents) have the right to insist that Godless evolution not be taught to their
children ... ”
The theory of natural selection proposed in the Origin o f Species 140 years
ago alleges that life on E arth began with simple microscopic organisms, and
through the process of m utation, in which those organisms with the most
environm entally adaptable traits survived to pass their traits on to future
generations, some of these organisms eventually evolved into the hum an species.
The intelligent-design theory proposed in O f Pandas and People alleges that
earth ’s history is a record of catastrophic intensities of natural processes
operating within natural laws, and that hum an beings w ere created in full hum an
form possessing a spiritual nature, which is a supernaturally created entity
distinct from biological life. O f the two theories, the natural selection theory is
better supported by existing scientific evidence.
Like all theories, both the natural selection theory and the intelligent-design
theory have their problems. For the intelligent-design theory, the idea that the
earth is about 10,00 years old is contradictory to the existing scientific evidence
found by geologists, which indicates that the earth is about 4.5 billion years old.

For evolution, the idea that a complex organization like n atu re began as a
series of accidents seems too coincidental, even though it is supported by existing
scientific evidence.
O ne possible but unlikely solution to the problem of creationism vs. evolution
is to teach both and let the students decide which theory is best. However, in
1987, the U.S.. Suprem e C ourt, declared that a 1981 Louisiana law requiring the
teaching of creationism along with evolution was unconstitutional. The Suprem e
C ourt held that the intent of the Louisiana law was to teach religion as science,
a breach of the separation of church and state.
Many evolutionists contend that evolution should be taught as fact in school
because, although it is only a theory and it is possible that it might eventually be
overturned by a new theory which better explains the facts, it is still the best the
best current theory to explain existing scientific evidence. M any evolutionists
also point out that there is massive am ounts of supporting scientific evidence for
the theory of evolution. As long as the debate betw een creationism and
evolution continues and the controversy prevents teachers from teaching how
life on earth was created, students all over the country will miss out on an
im portant part o f their education.

If SIUE needs a live mascot, then
it needs to re-examine its values

Think before you do

You know, it really is a shame that the live cougar mascot was a security problem for public
appearance purposes. It’s a shame that our school is no longer unique in caging up a live,
breathing, feeling animal for the purposes of prom oting school spirit and unity among
students. It’s also a shame that the school no longer provides a unique symbol for the campus.
All of the concerns and problem s posed by owning a live cougar were just too much for our
University to afford. Concerns such as the high cost of insurance for the cougar guard and the
poor condition of the cage, which could have possibly posed a security problem. All of these
problems that ham pered the university’s owning a live cougar mascot were about money,
money, and more money. Never once did 1 hear about the inhum ane treatm ent incurred upon
the animals. Never once did I hear about the lack of natural habitat for Chimega and Kyna, the
cougars that were kept at SIUE. N ever once did I hear what the caged condition did to the
psyche of the cougars.
Instead I heard of public appearances made with Kyna under restraints. I heard of both
cougars being de-clawed, and having filed fangs. I heard of two cougars sharing a small,
divided, dom ed cage. Sure, the cougars were probably taken out for exercise. But how often?
For how long? Sure, Chimega and Kyna probably didn’t mind one bit having their fangs filed
and claws removed. Sure, a cougar in bondage probably makes for a happy cougar.
If SIU E needs a live mascot to be known, if the school needs a live cougar to build school
spirit for its human students, and if it also needs a live animal to prom ote unity among students,
then I think SIU E also needs a serious re-examination of its values and supposed public image.
Perhaps SIU E needs new priorities instead. Priorities like the school’s purchase of some more
pretty trash can covers instead of m ore recycling bins. Priorities like a three-fold increase in
parking fees instead of a three-fold increase in student services. Priorities like additional
officers to hand out an even m ore absurd num ber of parking tickets instead of SIU E planning
more campus activities to keep students here and help eliminate the commuter-college image.
Although the school’s spirit is broken, I am sure that our campus can find a way out of the
deeply troubled times of settling for a weak, costum ed mascot versus a real, caged mascot.
Long live hum ankind’s constant dom ination and subjugation of the wild and ignorant natural
world. Long live my right to use nature as I choose with no regard for the consequences. Long
live capitalism and false-consciousness. Long live manifest destiny!
Chris Manners
Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC)

I hate stupid people. Not necessarily people with a low
intelligence level, but people who don’t use the common sense
that God gave a horse.
For example, last Thursday when the sun was actually
shining and everyone was running around in their shorts and
sandals, three men sat on the benches in the Quadrangle and
threw nuts at a squirrel in a tree, trying to knock it down.
I know they were trying to knock the squirrel down
because one intelligent gentlem an screamed, “Hey, let’s knock
that squirrel out of the tree!”
I had been sitting maybe ten feet away on the lawn when I
heard the brilliant exclamation and looked up just in time to
make eye contact with one of them who was getting ready to
hurl another nut at the animal.
He wittingly replied, “Look, that chick is watching us.”
Okay, first of all, I am not a chick. A chick, according to
W ebster’s Dictionary, is any young bird or child. I am neither. 1
am a woman, a young woman and I am to be referred to as a
woman. I don’t go around saying, “Hey there, duckling,” to
men, so why am I a chick?
Second of all, why in the world would someone want to
knock a squirrel out of a tree? I m ean, we are in college,
supposedly through puberty and the childish stage w here we
burn ants with a magnifying glass, so what is the problem ?
Mr. Squirrel was minding his own business, gnawing on an
acorn and doing what squirrels do. There was no need for
anyone to try and harm him in any way. So why try?
If they had wanted to pass time, they could have read a
book or had an intelligent (or even a not-so-intelligent)
conversation. At least they would be doing something a little
more constructive and a lot m ore age appropriate.
My point of this whole article is this: Think before you do.
It doesn’t take that long, just a few seconds to say, “Hey, do I
really need to knock that squirrel out of that tree?” I am sure
that you will be a lot happier—and a lot less stupid-looking to
those around you.

Several SIU E students felt that the event was a
step toward building a bigger event for upcoming
years.
“ I think it was a very successful event. I hope next
year we receive full participation from the nine
black G reek organizations,” Student Body Vice
President Fabian Wright said.
O thers felt the show brought up the appearance
and visibility of SIUE.
“I think it (the show) was a stepping-stone to
som ething better. It was a step towards m ore G reek
and African Am erican unity,” John Smith, a 21-yearold senior m ajoring in television/radio, said. “ I hope
there will be a bigger participation to help put this
school on the m ap as far as being a social and
learning environm ent.”
SIU E faculty who also took part in the event
agreed with the success of the step show. C onnon D.

C am pbell, coordinator for G reek Life, gave his
assessm ent on the show.
“The operation went great. Perform ances were
very good, very enthusiastic. I ’ll say one thing: it’s
certainly got people interested in next year. I hope to
have a bigger and b etter show next year.”
O ne of the judges for the contest. D errick Wright
of University B ookstore, com m ented on the talent
of the show.
“The organizations out there perform ed very
well. Also, for next year, we need to have m ore
G reek organizations stepping and m ore advisors
judging,” W right said.
Steven Sperotto, director of Kimmel Leadership,
was very im pressed with the entire aspect of the
show.
“1 thought it was a wonderful effort for our
campus community. It provided G reeks to showcase
their talents. It also developed spirit and unity,”
S perotto said.

University Restaurant:
E s c a p e fro m

t h e ru s h o f t h e c a fe te r ia

By Ja im e Pow ers
For th e A lestle

On the second floor of the
University Center, your home away
home, there is a place where you
can escape from the rush of the
lines in the cafeteria.
The University Restaurant
provides a niche where students,
faculty, staff and guests of the
university can enjoy table service
ambiance in a relaxing
atm osphere. The restaurant
features an "all you care to eat"
salad bar, along with daily lunch
specials and a luncheon menu. The
restaurant is open from 11:30 a.m.
to 2 p.m. for those who wish to
take a break from studies or
escape from a busy day of
meetings.
The recently renovated
restaurant features new carpeting
and wallpaper and personalized SIUE drinking glasses. In
an effort to create a more contemporary look, tablecloths
were removed and vases of flowers were added to the
tables.
Kerry Boudoures, the assistant Food Service director,
said, "The purpose is to have a place where students feel
comfortable."
The menu at the University Restaurant offers a variety of
food choices. Besides the popular "unlimited" trips to the
salad bar, options include a University Burger and
vegetarian entrees. All the items are at prices ranging from
$3.40 to $4.95, and the restaurant is part of the meal plan
packages. Quests of the restaurant may pay by cash, check
or credit card.
The waiters and w aitresses are all student employees.
Boudoures says she feels the restaurant is beneficial to the
them.
"The restaurant is a good work atm osphere where
students receive experience dealing with people," she
said.
The University Restaurant seats approximately 150
people, which makes it a great place for small lunch
meetings. In the past, the restaurant has held alumni
dinners, award banquets and has sponsored events by the
Comedy Club.
ki order to attract newcomers, the restaurant held a
Disney Day where the magic of Walt Disney was celebrated
during lunch. For St. Patrick's Day, the restaurant offered
festive food in honor of the Irish tradition.
April is the "Month of Great Cheesecake" in the
University Restaurant. During the month, a different
cheesecake will be offered each week, including chocolate
chip, am aretto, oreo, raspberry swirl and blueberry.

In addition to these activities, the restaurant offers a
catering service available to students, faculty and staff.
The University Restaurant is also open during the
summer. The sum m er menu is a "help yourself" buffet
that includes soup, salads and sandwiches.
The Food Service
administration wants the
restaurant to be a place
where students can go
anytime.
Boudoures adds, "The
philosophy of the
restaurant is to provide
a fine dining service,
including waiters and
waitresses, to
students."

Go back to the school house that rocks
By Lcnon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
Early in the semester, I reviewed an album
full of songs by bands covering cartoon themes
and tunes from the shows. If you were one of
those kids w ho w atched cartoons every
Saturday, then you probably knew most of
what was on the disc. Now there is a perfect
com panion piece for all of your G eneration XProzac m em ories— the disc titled School
House Rock! Rocks.
For those who d o n ’t know, School House
Rock was a series of educational shorts played

on television Saturday mornings that started in
the early 70’s. Congress passed a law stating
th at netw orks w ere req u ired to provide
educational program m ing for children. ABC
responded with forty-one songs dealing with
m ath, history, gram m ar and science. W hen the
law was reversed in the m iddle 80’s, the
netw ork quit running the spots. It wasn’t until
recently that the shorts where put back into the
Saturday cartoon rotation.
F ifteen o f th e forty-one songs are
represented on this album, and there is not a
bad one in the bunch. It starts off with the

original them e, and then goes into Deluxx Folk Implosion’s
version of “I ’m Just a Bill.” A lthough different than the
original, it definitely has a style that you will love.
Blind Melon gives us their rendition of “Three Is A Magic
Num ber,” and it may be the best song they have ever done. This
song is true to the original, and brings the m em ories flooding
back.
The interpretations where the bands exercise their “artistic
expression” are good. A lthough not sounding like the originals,
the songs are fun and not by any m eans ruined. Pavement gives
us a wonderful version of “No M ore Kings”— listen for Bob
yelling and screaming in the background. Moby takes the song
“Verb: T h at’s W hat’s H ap p en in g ” and brings it into the
electronic age like only M oby can.
O f the renditions that are true to the originals, “Unpack Your
A djectives” by D aniel Johnson is the winner, and probably the
best song on the album. “Electricity, Electricity” by Goodness is
good, and Biz M arkie (no, h e’s not dead) doing “The Energy
Blues” is great.
This is an album that will put a smile on your face and a
bounce in your step. If th at’s not enough of a reason to buy this,
a portion of all proceeds from sales go to the C hildren’s
D efense Fund. They are a nonprofit research and advocacy
organization that pays attention to the needs of poor, needy and
disabled children who don’t have the power to vote, lobby or
speak out.

For those of you who want the original songs, not covers, you
can wait for the box set, due out soon on the Kid Rhino label,
which will contain all forty-one tunes. T here are four videos
with all of the original episodes, along with an official guide
book. You can have it all and be transported to another place,
anytime you want. Like I’ve said before, it’s always Saturday

T rack h o sts S I U E R e la y s
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor

Jeremy Paschall/A/es//e

Jenny Hagel and the rest of the Cougars split four games over the
weekend to move their record up to 31-11 and second place in the GLVC.

The C ougar track team hosted the
SIU E Relays this Saturday at Olympic
Stadium and just as the title reads,
relays were the main attraction of the
meet.
SIU E is mainly a long distance team
but is in the process of becoming a full
fledged track program . As of right now,
they have a few sprinters and a couple
field event competitors.
But like always, the C ougar’s main
events were usually the ones that take
m ore than a m inute to complete.
Starting things off for the Cougars
was the m en’s distance medley, in which
SIU E took first place with a time of 10
minutes, 55 seconds. This was thirteen
seconds faster than the second place
finishers
from
O livet
N azarene
University.
The Cougars finished second in the
1,600-m eter relay falling behind
Florissant Valley by 22 seconds. SIU E
had a time of 3:33.
O n the w om en’s side of the race,
S IU E also took second behind
Florissant Valley with a time of 4:20.
Then the m en and wom en raced in
the 3,200-meter relay with both the
Cougars’ team s taking top billing. The
m en outran their closest opponent, St.
Louis University, by 29 seconds and the

w om en b eat O livet N azarene by 8
seconds.
The Cougars also had some strong
individual perform ances Saturday.
Travis R oundcount in the 1,500-meter
run finished second with a time of 4:06.
R o u n d co u n t was ju st two seconds
behind Tim Flam er who was running the
event unattached from any school. In
the sam e race, Jason G ass finished
eighth.
The women had some good runs in
the 1,500-meter run as Jacqi Vazquez
took second in the event and team m ate
Libby Mullivain followed right behind
with a third place finish. Vazquez had a
time of 5:21 and Mullivain finished at
5:37.
Like always, th ere are some
exceptions to the norm. The normal
being long distance running for SIUE,
but in this case L aquetta D obbs took
fourth in the 100 yard dash with a time
of 13.53 seconds.
In an o th er medley, the wom en
finished third in the 1,600-meter sprint
m edley just seconds behind Greenville
College who took second.
S IU E ’s A ndrew M iller finished fifth
in the 3,000 m eter steeplechase with a
time of 11:15.
The Cougars will again host an event
this coming Saturday when all of the
G reat Lakes Valley C onference comes
to com pete for the top spots.

Baseball regroups with four wins
Softball misses opportunity
to take top spot in the GLVC
By Eli Savoie

Sports Reporter
The SIU E softball team started their w eekend in Kenosha, Wisconsin
with two tough losses to the num ber one team in the G reat Lakes Valley
Conference, but regrouped by taking two games from St. Joseph’s College.
The Cougars played well on Saturday against W isconsin-Parkside in
their first two games.
A 6-3 loss to the R angers in game one saw Bridgeton, Mo., native Kim
M essinger go 2-for-3 at the plate and Christy Perry of Edwardsville hit one
out of the park.
Freshm an Jessica Silbe’s record on the m ound fell to 13-7 for the
season.
The second game was even closer as SIU E fell by the score of 6-5 to
Parkside.
Collinsville’s Jennifer Smith supplied the offense by going 3-for-4 with
a hom e run.
Junior M ichele Sucich and M essinger both contributed with one hit
each.
D eanna Smith lost only her fourth contest of the season.
“I think that we are a b etter team than Parkside,” said head coach
Sandy Montgomery. “We just didn’t get the breaks. We didn’t play as sharp
as we should have.”
Cold w eather was a factor in the doubleheader against St. Joseph
College on Sunday afternoon. The Cougars braved the elem ents to win
both gam es against their GLVC foe.
SIU E defeated the Lady Pum as 8-0 in the first game with some help by
J. Smith and Y orke’s two R B I’s a piece. Sucich also added an RBI single
along with Perry and Thorp driving in a run each.
Irf game two, the Cougars continued the battering with a 3-1 victory.
“We came out strong in both games,” said Montgomery. “These were
the coldest conditions that I have ever seen for a game, but we handled the
w eather well.”
Perry drove in two of the Cougars three runs as she went 2-for-2 and
team m ate Sucich contributed w ith.an R B I single in the third inning.
SIU E is currently 31-11 overall and in second place in the GLVC.
The C ougars play next in a d o u b leh ea d er to d a y ' with IU P U Indianapolis at the SIU E field at 4 p.m.

A noticeable change has taken place
in the dem eanor of SIU E head baseball
coach G ary Collins from last week to
this w eek, and the reasons for the
change are obvious.
The Cougars went on the road over
the weekend and not only ended a sixgame losing streak, but brought hom e a
m odest four-game winning streak after
sweeping doubleheaders from Lewis
and Wisconsin-Parkside.
The Cougars avenged a pair of early
season losses with Saturday’s sweep of
Lewis at R om eoville. T he C ougars
com bined som e solid pitching with
timely hitting to come away with an 8-5
extra-inning victory in the first game
and a 7-4 win in the nightcap.
O n Sunday, the C ougars’ offensive
attack continued to roll as they
pounded out 21 hits in the two games on
the way to a 7-4 win in game one and a
7-2 victory in the second game that
com pleted a perfect weekend.
“We finally decided we just needed
to play,” Collins said
M onday
afternoon. “There was no pressure on us
so we just relaxed and played.”
Collins said the first game of the
weekend was the key to the C ougars’
success for the entire trip.
“We came back in that first game and
ended up winning in extra innings,” he
said. “That got everyone pum ped up for
the rest the w eekend.”
In that crucial game, the Cougars
trailed 5-1 with only two innings to play,
but th at’s when the offense woke up.
The Cougars put two on the board in
the sixth to cut the lead to two.
The Cougars then sent the game into
extra innings by collecting another pair

of runs in the seventh with some help
from the Flyers. First, Lewis pitcher
D erek H art hit M ark Burris to start the
inning and an e rro r allow ed John
Spotanski to reach. W ith two outs,
Angel Santiago delivered a clutch single
to drive hom e the tying runs.
In the first extra inning, the Cougars’
offense continued to pour it on as they
put three m ore runs on the board for
the final margin of victory. The eighthinning rally was started by a Brian
G eluck hom e run and capped by a Ryan
Crawford tw o-run double.
Eric M umma, who went the distance
on the m ound for the Cougars, picked
up his fourth victory of the season.
Two-out hits like Santiago’s key hit
were som ething that Collins was happy
to see. H e said it was nice to get some of
them for a change after seeing how the
team has struggled to get timely hitting
the past couple of weeks.
In S atu rd ay ’s second gam e, the
Cougars led from start to finish as they
jum ped out to a 7-0 lead and eventually
held on for the win. Sophom ore Jeff
R idenour upped his record to 4-4 as he
threw his fifth com plete game of the
season.
Santiago once again led the offense
as he collected three m ore hits and two
RBI. Briggs also had a good showing at
the plate, going: 2-for-3 and driving in
three runs.
Sunday, the Cougars continued their
fine play against the R angers of
Parkside.
In the first contest, freshm an hurler
Jason G uest allowed only six hits and
one earned run as he picked up the
victory to move to 5-1 on the season.
The Cougars used a balanced offense in
