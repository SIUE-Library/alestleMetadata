Reginald Jones to
E x e r c is in g v o t i n g r ig h t s speak at SIUE campus
on problems facing
the inner cities
■ BY THOMAS
BANHOLZER
FOR THE ALESTLE

Jill StevenslAlestle
On Tuesday and Wednesday all students were able to choose who th ey want to
represent them by voting for student governm ent officers. This voting booth was
located in the University Center next to the Information Center. The electees will take
office in the fall o f 1998 and continue into the spring o f 1999.

“Why Puff Daddy is a
Capitalist? Learn How Free
Markets Can Save Our Inner
Cities!” will be the topic of
discussion as Reginald Jones
speaks about the*problems facing
the inner cities. Illegitimacy, free
market
capitalism,
racism,
poverty and big government will
be some of the topics explored.
Jones will be speaking in the
Maple-Dogwood Room in the
University Center April 15 at
7:30 p.m. This event is presented
by the SIUE College Republicans
and the Young A m erica’s
Foundation, and is funded in part
by student activity fees.
“We are proud to have
Reginald Jones as our first
speaker. He is the epitome of the
American dream and highly
knowledgeable
regarding
political issues,” Jamie Currier,
vice president of the SIUE
College Republicans, said.
In the ‘80s, free enterprise
and rap were under heavy fire by
the media and America. Today,

Reginald Jones
however, there is an American
who ties free enterprise and rap
into a fiscally conservative
message to talk to young
Americans about the advantage
of a free market economy.
Reginald Jones is that American.
Mr. Jones came from a modest
background. Growing up in
South Bronx, Mr. Jones came
from a less than opportune
background. He makes no
excuses for his past and is rather
proud of it. His father, a
sanitation worker, and mother, a
secretary, taught Jones that hard
work is necessary to make it
through life.

Volunteers needed for Earth Day Project in the Gateway area
■ BY ALICIA M.
MIDDENDOR
NEWS STRINGER
A typical day for many SIUE
students involves going to class,
going to work, eating, sleeping,
doing homework and having
a little free time to spend
with friends, relaxing and
participating in a favorite
pastime.
Well, why not spend some of
that free time volunteering during
Earth Week, beginning April 20?
The Gateway A rea Storm
Sewer Stenciling Project is an
educational project funded by a
grant from the U nited States
Environmental
Protection

Agency Region V that strives to
educate the entire community. In
hopes
of
creating
public
attentiveness
and
action
concerning pollution, the project
combines
the
energy
and
excitement of local elementary
and middle school children with
that of volunteers. The Gateway
Area Storm Sewer Stenciling
Project strives to educate the
people of Madison and St. Clair
counties on the excessive
amounts of non-point source
pollution in the area. Being a
non-point
source
pollution,
environmentalists are unable to
attribute the pollution to one
individual source. Therefore,
since the source of pollution can

not be pinpointed, the problem
becomes a community problem
that
requires
community
solutions. In order to resolve the
problem, the community must be
educated as to the range of
pollutants that can contaminate
the local atmosphere, waterways
and groundwater. Such pollutants
are pesticides, coolants, paints
and oil products that run off of
roads, parking lots, farm fields,
lawns and roofs.
Volunteers are needed to
walk with the local children and
supervise each child as he or she
stencils a storm sewer in the area
during Earth week.

National Association of
Black Student Social
Workers to sponsor “old
school” talent show
■ BY DOREEN VAN
LEE
NEWS STRINGER
Is time moving too fast for
you? Well, take time to slow it
down by taking a trip into
the past.
The National Association of
Black Student Social Workers
(NABSSW ) is sponsoring a
talent show tonight at 7 p.m. in
the Cougar Den. The theme of
the talent show is O ld School
Jams. Regina M outon, president
of NABSSW, said that this show
is one of the organizations first
grand scale events of the year.
“We have a num ber of
other activities that we are in
the process of working on for
this school year but this is
indeed one of the biggest events
w e’ve put together so far,”
Mouton said '
Kelsia
Johnson,
vice
president of NABSSW said she
is looking forward to a great
turnout for the talent show. She

As a result, the stencils will
aid as warnings to the community
of the correlation between people
and environmental quality. This
then educates the community as
to its responsibility to natural
habitats, sewers, drinking water
and its downstream neighbors.
M ost importantly, in order
for the 120 schools from 18 cities
and towns, such as Alton,
Bethalto, Wood River, Granite
City, Fairmount City, Caseyville,
E. St. Louis and C ahokia in
Madison and St. Clair counties to
participate in the
project,

urges anyone to come out and
enjoy the great talent which is
lined up.
Sandra Scott, secretary of
NABSSW, said that NABSSW
is an organization with a student
membership o f diverse cultural
backgrounds and anyone is
welcome to participate.
“Our
organization
is
interested in show casing a
variety of talent on and around
the SIUE campus,” Scott said.
“We have various acts from tap
dancers to poets slated to appear
in the talent show. There is no
formal
audition
but
a
prospective perform er should
arrive an hour earlier.”
Scott
said
everyone’s
support for this event would be
greatly appreciated.
Admission for the show is
$3.
Prizes
will
include
certificates
and
trophies.

volunteers are needed. SIUE
students, faculty and local
community members are needed
as volunteers to participate with
the local children to make
this area-wide awareness project
a success.
Volunteering can be an
interesting, exciting and a
rew arding
venture.
This
volunteer program does not have
any requirements. If you would
like to volunteer, you do not have
to have a scientific background in
environmental studies; all you
must have is an interest in your

and
in

Jones’ character also largely
was affected by the late Bishop S.
McDowell Shelton who armed
him with the morality he has
today. “He (Bishop Shelton) said
to never use my race as an excuse
for failure. As a son of God, I was
entitled to success. But it would
not be given to me. I would have
to fight for it,” Jones said.
Self-sufficiency, however,
has been Jo n es’ reason for
success. Jones’ political ideas are
a mix of Libertarian and
Republican views.
Reginald Jones began his
career as a writer. However, a
phone call to the “Rush
Lim baugh Show ” began his

hosts his own show on the

called
“Grassroots Live.”
“Reginald Jones is so great
because he has risen from a
less then privileged back­
ground,” Matt Gross, president of
the SIUE College Republicans,
said. “It is so easy for Mr. Jones
to provide exam ples of iiow
big government and taxes have
harmed inner cities because
he has seen these examples
firsthand.”
“I am a b o u t fre e d o m ,”
says Jones. “Freedom to me

Jesse Jackson and Farakhan don’t

said Jones.
Reginald’s speech also will
include the history of rap, which
had its beginnings in his own
neighborhood, and how it has
affected
his
political
and
economical beliefs.
Jones will be the first

Now you are getting Letters to the e d i t o r --------------------------------Featuring letters from all around campus with some point, counterpoint on
sleepy, very sleepy some
Clinton/Corey criticism and then Corey Stulce’s response.
I’m a chronic sleeper. I need eight to nine hours of
sleep a night to function normally. Without sleep, I lose
control of all ability to stay awake in class. I fall asleep
in almost all o f my classes, no matter how interesting or
how boring. I'm just tired.
Danielle
Many college students are just tired, but some
Belton student's exhaustion seems a little worse than others. 1
sympathize with anyone who is stressed out by college.
Some (mostly our parents), say that the reason we are so tired is that
college students don’t manage their time very well and they don’t
make wise choices. That may be true in some aspects, but the whole
truth would be that most college students simply do too much.
Many college students here are trying to juggle a college career,
a job, a social life and maintain their sanity. I currently have
eighteen hours worth of classes, and I work 22 hours a week plus I
have a close network of friends that I have a hard time saying “no”
to, because I like them so much. There have been many times I’ve
come home from the Alestle office at night around 10 p.m., planning
to read one of my assignments then go to sleep, instead I find myself
at my friends’ apartment engaging in conversation and playing
spades till three in the morning. Bad judgement, perhaps. As I am
writing this I am periodically falling asleep, only to jerk myself
awake again.
Then, I find m yself making plans to sleep the entire weekend,
and I end up getting no sleep on the weekend for one reason or
another. Life is exhausting. I tell myself I’m going to manage my
time better, but I don’t have enough time to manage my time, and I
never get around to it.
It is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world. There is hope.
We could all drop out of school perhaps. Maybe w e’ll all enroll
in a beauty college, maybe we could all be managers at M cDonald’s.
OK. I am being a bit sarcastic, but the fact is, if you have a truly
American mind-set about success and work, you believe in doing
too much in hope that you’ll be able to rest better and easier later.
It’s the American way. I actually kind of like the more laid-back
Latin culture where, if it’s not life threatening or work related —
come late, leave late, take a nap in the afternoon. So perhaps from
now on, no students should schedule classes at two o ’ clock. Let’s
all take a 30 minute to an hour nap. I actually prefer the library
myself for taking a midday nap.
Now, if perhaps this column seems to be less edgy or less
political than others, it’s because I have a headache and also because
I'm having a little trouble finding out what bothers other students,
and not just what bothers me. So read the following below and send
me your response.
Though I try to stay abreast of current topics, I often find myself
at a loss for ideas for my editorial column. If you feel that there is a
pressing issue pertaining to campus life here at SIUE or the lives of
students and faculty in general that are being ignored, write your
question or comment to me at the Alestle. Your idea or question will
be run, along with my article, and I will write an editorial pertaining
to your issue.
E-mail your questions, comments and responses to
dbelton@siue.edu, or write them down on a piece of paper and
drop them off at the Alestle office on the second floor of the
University Center.

Bedroom Politics
Although I sincerely hope
that Corey Stulce was joking in
his Rants & Raves column on
Tuesday, 1 think it is my
obligation to respond.
Mr. Stulce seems to believe
that President Clinton’s current
sex scandal is no big deal. He
dismisses President C linton’s
actions by saying, “Without the
occasional run through the lilies,
he would be on edge. President
Clinton would have to get
satisfaction
elsewhere,
like
picking fights with defenseless
countries.” Mr. Stulce also seems
to think that men who abstain
from sex or rem ain loyal to
wives and girlfriends
are
“sexually frustrated.”
I hope the Alestle readers do
not think that I believe infidelity
should be illegal. However, I do
believe that it is wrong and I will
stand against it. Although I “tsk
tsk” those who treat women like
dirt, that does not mean I need to
“get a hobby” or mind my own
business as Mr. Stulce asserts. 1
hope the Alestle readers do not
seriously believe that it is ok for a
man to look a woman in the eyes
and tell her that he loves her only
to fool around behind her back.
If you want to “avoid that
breakdow n” by “hanging a
banana out of your posterior” as

Mr. Stulce suggests, simply
refrain from getting married. A
woman should be treated as a
lady, not a floozy.
This investigation is not
meant to punish our “sexually
satisfied” president for fooling
around. There are other issues
such as perjury, obstruction of
justice and sexual harassm ent
that need to be addressed. Until
those issues are resolved, the
investigation should continue.
Matt Gross
President,
SIUE College Republicans

Mr. Stulce’s response
To put your mind at ease, Mr.
Gross, of course I was joking in
my column on Tuesday. I don’t
think infidelity is right, but I
also don’t think that the private
life of our president is any of our
business.
If we were more paparazzilike at the Alestle, we might want
to look into your life, Mr. Gross.
You are the president of the
college Republicans. Do we, as
students, have a right to know
what you do after leaving campus
for the day? Would you like to
have every acquaintance of yours
interviewed and every little thing
you do scrutinized? W hat might
we see? What could be contorted

as sleazy or wrong? How clean is
your conscious? Have you ever
done anything you’re ashamed
of? Anything naughty? W hat
would you like to hide, Mr.
Gross? We could find it all out.
Inquiring minds want to know.
You see, that is my point.
The people in the world today are
too obsessed with things that
aren’t their business. If there
were a tabloid paper based
entirely on the lives of each and
everyone in the world, I think
people would be a lot less nosy.
No, I don’t think the sex
scandal is a big deal. Not in
comparison to the real problems
plaguing our nation. It’s time that
we stop listening to every loon
with a vendetta to discredit
Clinton. He’s ours, like it or not,
until the new century. Let him get
back to work.
1 don’t mind having my
words taken very seriously, or for
people to draw their own
meaning from them. But, by God,
I don’t want people to take them
so seriously. I am not an authority
on anything. I’m just a man with
a computer who likes to put a few
words down.
Don’t get me wrong, I want
my opinion on all matters to be
heard, just taken with a grain
of salt.

House majority leader rips 'shameless’ Clinton
COPPELL, Texas (AP) — House Majority Leader
Dick Armey says that if he were facing the same sexual
misconduct allegations as President Bill Clinton, he
would resign.
“I believe he’s a shameless person,” Armey told about
50 government students Monday at Coppell High School.
“If it were me that had documented personal conduct
along the lines of the president’s, I would be so filled with
shame that I would resign,” he said. "This president w on’t
do that. His basic credo in life is, ‘I will do whatever I can
get away with.’”
Armey’s remarks were some of the harshest yet by a

top Republican since a U.S. judge dismissed Paula Corbin
Jones’ sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president
last week.
Armey continued his attack Tuesday, saying it was a
matter of personal responsibility, “a value all parents try
to instill in their children, as a crucial element of good
character.
“I stand by my rem arks, which reinforced the
importance of personal responsibility. I could not let these
children think this president is a good role model,” he said
in a statement.
Since allegations surfaced that Clinton had an affair

with a White House volunteer and encouraged her to lie
about it, Republicans have generally been restrained in
their criticism, although many have said the president
should resign if the allegations are proven true.
Deputy White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told
The Dallas Morning News that the president was "entirely
focused on doing the job that the American public sent
him to Washington to do.”
“The strongest economy in history, falling crime rates
and welfare rolls dropping to record-low levels do not
allow the president to contemplate any suggestions from
Mr. Armey,” Lockhart said.

Israel on high alert following new shooting in Jerusalem
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel
was on high alert for new
disturbances today after police
shot and killed a Palestinian
driver they said ignored an order
to stop at a Jerusalem checkpoint.
Protests broke
out late
M onday
in
several
Arab
neighborhoods of the city after
the shooting o f M oham m ed
Salaimi, a 25-year-old driver.
Jerusalem Police Chief Yair
Yitzhaki said police flagged
down Salaimi’s van because they
suspected it was stolen. When the
van didn’t stop, they chased it
through the city, then opened fire.
The shooting was justified
because the van “broke through
two checkpoints and ram m ed
several vehicles, including a

police car,” Yitzhaki
told
Israel Radio.
Yitzhaki said the police aimed
for the wheels o f the van but —
because they were firing from a
speeding car hit the driver. The
Justice Ministry is investigating
the incident.
A ministry spokesm an said
today
that
Salaim i
was
apparently trying to evade
police because he did not have a
drivers license.
In a separate incident, police
said
they
arrested
two
Palestinians near the scene of the
shooting with a Beretta handgun,
a toy pistol, a stocking mask
and handcuffs.
Following the shooting, which
took
place
in
the
Arab

neighborhood of Kalandia, Arab
residents stoned police cars and
buses, burned tires and threw
a firebomb.
The dead m an’s family told
Israel Radio that he was on his
way to visit his wife.
Also today, Ham as leaders
stepped up their criticism of the
Palestinian Authority, which
cleared Israel in the March 29
killing of the group’s chief
bombmaker.
Abdel Aziz Rantisi, a Hamas
leader in the Gaza Strip, said the
group rejected the Palestinian
A uthority’s
findings
that
bombmaker M ohiyedine Sharif
had been shot by a rival Hamas
member who tried to cover up the
slaying by disfiguring the body in

a bomb blast.
The Palestinian Authority
announced its findings Monday.
Hamas, however, continued to
blame Israel ajid said it would
make good on threats to carry out
revenge bombings in Israel.
Rantisi said he believed Sharif
was killed in an effort to stop the
activities of the Hamas military
wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
Izzedine al Qassam “continues its
investigation, not only to prove
that Israel is involved, but to find
out who are the tools who carried
out this crime,” he said.
Rantisi had insinuated earlier
that the Palestinian A uthority
might have been involved in
the slaying.
He demanded today that the

Palestinian Authority set up an
independent
com m ittee
to
investigate Sharif’s killing.
Israeli
Prim e
M inister
Benjam in
Netanyahu
said
M onday
that
the
Sharif
investigation proved that the
Palestinian
A uthority
was
capable of fighting terrorism and
that it must continue its efforts.
In response to Hamas threats,
Israeli security forces have been
patrolling markets, malls and bus
stations in Jerusalem and other
cities, and tightening controls at
West Bank roadblocks.
Israel was expected to seal
off the West Bank and Gaza
Strip before the start Friday of
the w eeklong Jew ish holiday
of
Passover
to
prevent
possible attacks.

Voluntary declarations of homosexuality increasing
W ASHINGTON (AP) —
Defense
Secretary
W illiam
Cohen
has
ordered
new
guidelines to explain and enforce
the Clinton adm inistration’s
policy barring the pursuit and
harassment of homosexuals in
the military.
“Some commanders haven’t
gotten the message,” Cohen said
in a N ational Public Radio
interview Tuesday.
“I have tried to make it very
clear that we want this policy
fully and fairly im plem ented.
That means there’s to be no
pursuit, there’s to be no
harassm ent, and if it’s taking
place, it’s something I’m very
concerned about,” Cohen said.
The “don’t ask, d o n ’t tell,
don’t pursue” policy was initiated

in 1994 amid great controversy,
attempting to strike a balance
between prohibited homosexual
conduct in the m ilitary and
attempts to maintain the privacy
of those who choose not to
declare their sexual orientation.
M eanwhile,
the
Defense
Department released a report
showing the number of people
discharged for hom osexuality
climbed from 850 in 1996 to 997
last year. The lowest number
discharged was 617 in 1994,
while the highest in recent years
was 1,998 in 1982, the report
said. That high number amounted
to 0.095 percent of the total force.
The report also said that 80
percent of those discharged for
homosexuality in 1997 had made
a statement that they were

*

homosexual. More than 80
percent of those discharged had
less than four years of service,
the study said.
“In the most common case, a
discharge under the homosexual
conduct policy involves a junior
enlisted member who makes a
statement declaring his or her
homosexuality to a commander,
supervisor or peer relatively early
in the m ember’s first term of
service,” the report stated.
The secretary said he does not
believe the new figures indicate
that harassment is on the rise.
The report argued that
the policy was being fairly
and properly enforced, Cohen
noted, but he added, “It’s
conceivable, and it’s possible,
that some commanders haven’t

gotten the message.”
Those who do engage in witch
hunts, Cohen warned, will
themselves “be the subject of
their own investigation” and
potentially charged with sexual
harassment.
The report said without
elaboration that in only three
cases had the policy not been
properly enforced.
Critics of the policy said
Cohen would not have issued the
directives, if indeed the policy
was being properly enforced.
“The policy itself is not being
followed dow n the chain of
command and the core problem
of anti-gay bias goes completely
unaddressed,” said a statement
issued by Winnie Stachelberg,
political director of the Human

Rights Campaign, a national gay
political organization.
“The
policy is not working because
com m anders in the field are
continuing to ask and pursue,
hunting down gay service
members unabated.”
Some of C ohen’s other
recommendations include:
Military commanders should
consult with their superiors and
military legal authorities before
embarking on investigations of
suspected homosexuals.
Authorization
for
investigations
in
situations
dubbed “coming-out” cases must
be approved by the service
secretaries.
Commanders and investigators
need more training
about
the policy.

Cops who pleaded guilty to corruption are fired
WEST NEW YORK, N.J. (AP) — Three police
officers who admitted taking bribes in what prosecutors
have described as the most pervasive police corruption
ever exposed in New Jersey have been fired, officials said.
Detective Lt. Alexander L. Oriente, Detective Sgt.
Carmine Gaeta and Officer Manuel Gonzales were fired
effective immediately at a disciplinary hearing Monday,
Public Safety Commissioner Sal Vega said.
None of the men appeared at the hearing. Oriente
and Gonzales had been suspended since they were arrested
Jan. 13.

Oriente’s father, retired Chief Alexander V. Oriente,
and other officers were charged in January with taking at
least $600,000 in bribes and kickbacks to shield a
prostitution ring, illicit liquor sales and illegal gambling
operations in their town, just across the Hudson River
from New York City.
The elder Oriente pleaded guilty March 16 to a
single count each of racketeering and conspiracy to
defraud the IRS by failing to report $80,000 in bribes on
his income tax returns. His son admitted to a single
extortion count for taking money from the owners of an

G onzales adm itted accepting paym ents totaling
$2,166 from the city’s towing service for each ticket he
wrote that resulted in vehicles being towed.
Gaeta, who had applied for a disability retirement
March 1, pleaded guilty March 19 to two counts, extortion
and failing to report income from an illegal gambling
operation in W est New York. The 20-year veteran
admitted he failed to report bribes from Boardwalk

Father says Arkansas shootings suspect was molested
NEW YORK (AP) — The 13year-old boy accused o f killing
four students and a teacher at his
Arkansas school said he was
sexually molested while growing
up in Minnesota, according to his
father and his attorney.
Mitchell Johnson claimed he
was abused when he was 6 and 7
years old, his attorney, Tom
Furth, said in an interview
broadcast Monday night on ABC
News’ ‘"20-20.”
Mitchell and Drew Golden,
11, each face five counts of
murder and 10 counts o f firstdegree battery in the M arch 24
shooting outside a middle school
in Jonesboro, Ark.
Furth and M itchell’s father,
Scott
Johnson,
described
Mitchell as angry about the abuse
and rem orseful
about the
shootings. They said he had

received death threats.
Scott Johnson said he only
learned last week about his son’s
alleged abuse, two days before
the
interview,
which
was
recorded Sunday. The attacker
was “'a family member of the
day care where he was placed,”
Johnson said.
At the time, M itchell lived in
Grand Meadow, Minn., a small
town about 95 miles south of
M inneapolis.
His
parents
divorced and he later moved to
Jonesboro with his mother.
“M itchell Johnson is very
angry about some things that
have happened to him in his
past,” Furth said. “And he’s 13
years old, and he doesn’t know
how to handle some of these
things and he do esn ’t know
how to cope with some of
these things.”

• N either Furth nor Johnson letter was addressed.

Mitchell’s grandfather, Buster charged with molesting a 2- or 3Johnson of Spring Valley, Minn., year-old girl while visiting

Asked what he could say

“This is totally new to me,” about the incident, Johnson said
only: “That his actions were

Scott Johnson also read a letter he to the authorities.”
“I thought he would get help,”
said Mitchell wrote three days
ago. It was unclear to whom the he said.

The record o f that case is
closed because M itchell is a
juvenile.
If Mitchell is found guilty of
the school killings and sentenced
to a detention center, he likely
would be released at age 18.
Furth said M itchell’s family
fears for his life. Some letters
said Mitchell wouldn’t make it
out of a detention center alive,
Johnson said.
“1 have a very unpopular
client in this country, and that’s
because people don’t know the
answer to why (the shootings)
happened,” Furth said.
Johnson said he didn’t think
five years of detention was
enough, but when asked what
would be enough, he said:
“I don’t have an answer for
that. What is enough for five
lives? I d o n ’t think my son
should die.”

Husband still reeling after accusations w ife killed for a child
CHICAGO (AP) — Adriana
Mejia longed for a child.
And even though her husband
had his doubts, he kept quiet — at
first — when the 22-year-old
woman brought home an infant girl
she said was newborn, and a 3-yearold boy she said she was watching
for a woman she met at the hospital.
He knew how badly she
wanted a child. Then Rosauro Mejia

saw the news reports. A couple had
been slain and their two children
abducted.
“T can’t believe it even now,”
Mejia, 23, said Monday through a
Spanish-English translator. “I didn’t
see it coming.” He took the boy
to police.
Authorities said Mrs. Mejia
spotted Jacinita Soto and her baby
girl March 27 at a health clinic and

followed her to learn where she
lived. Mrs. Mejia paid $600 to
Arturo DeLeon-Reyes to help her,
and he in turn recruited Gabriel
Solache,
a
family
friend,
prosecutors said.
The next day, police said, the
three broke in on Mrs. Soto and her
husband, Mariano, a factory
worker, and stabbed them to death.
Then they took the couple’s

two children.
“They agreed that they would
do whatever they needed to do to
get a child, and that included
killing,” prosecutor Adrienne
Mebane said while a translator
whispered in Spanish to the three
defendants.
Police believe Mejia had no
knowledge of his wife’s plan.
Circuit Judge William Wood

ordered Mrs. Mejia an5 her two
alleged accomplices held without
bond. All three were charged
Sunday with first-degree murder,
kidnapping and home invasion.
All are illegal immigrants from
Mexico, said Gail Montenegro, a
spokeswoman for the

High school sophomore allegedly
compiled “hit list” of students
W EST LAFAYETTE, Ohio
(AP) — A Ridgew ood High
School sophom ore
has been
accused o f compiling a “hit list”
of students and teachers.
Schools Superintendent Victor
Cardenzana said he suspended
the unidentified 15-year-old for
the remainder of the school year
on M onday because, after last
m onth’s killings in Jonesboro,
Ark., “no one can treat this as
a prank.”
“I did my job and got him out
of here. It is my responsibility to
provide a safe environment for
kids,” Cardenzana said.

Cardenzana said the boy is
accused of creating the list of
about a dozen names using a
school computer the day after the
M arch 24 Arkansas attack in
which authorities say two
schoolboys shot and killed four
students and a teacher.
High school administrators
learned about the list from other
students, Cardenzana said.
He said the list was recorded
on a computer diskette which was
found in the boy’s possession.
The diskette contained the names,
the reason each person was on the
list and “how he was going to get

M ejia said he and his wife
had talked about having a child
and was happy when she said
she was pregnant. Prosecutors
said she had been diagnosed as
infertile last year.
“She was a good person,”
M ejia said. “I d id n ’t see
it com ing.”
It was the second tim e in less
than three years police say a
frustrated m aternal instinct
soured into a gruesom e murderkidnapping in the Chicago area.

In N ovem ber 1995, home
invaders broke into a suburban
apartment, killed a little girl
and then shot her m other in the
head, slit her throat, ripped a
fetus out of the pregnant
woman’s uterus and walked off
with the infant along with an
older boy, who later was killed.
A 1-year-old was left alone
amid the carnage. Jurors have
recommended a death sentence
for a woman convicted of the
crime; trials are pending for
two others.

involved with illegal video gambling.
“These men are corrupt police officers who have caused
immeasurable damage to the department, our community and the State
of New Jersey,” Vega told The Jersey Journal of Jersey City. “I believe
it’s important that such corrupt officers be immediately removed.”
Another retired officer has pleaded guilty; five suspended officers
and one retired officer await trial; four civilians have pleaded guilty
and 11 other people await indictment or trial.

it done, and also where they
lived,” Cardenzana said.
The superintendent was one of
those on the list.
“It didn’t make me feel
strange,” Cardenzana said. “But
I had a bomb threat at my
house on March 31. I can’t tie
the two events, but it bothered
my family.”
The diskette was turned over
to West Lafayette police, who
confirmed they are investigating.
Police Capt. Randy Walsh
declined com m ent, citing the
teen’s status as a juvenile.
Assistant C oshocton County
Prosecutor Pat W illiams today
said his office was investigating,
but he declined further comment.
Cardenzana said classes at the
school have not been affected by
the discovery of the list.
“It’s business as usual here.
Everything is quiet. We are
providing a safe environment to
the students and staff,” he
said today.
Cardenzana said he discussed
the incident with the boy’s father.
“The student definitely needs
some help,” he said.
West Lafayette is 75 miles east
of Columbus.

captured footage that told the tale of the destruction in
the heartland of America. “R oger” went on to
be the highest grossing non-concert documentary
in history.
“The Big One” is superior to “Roger” in terms of
focus. The film begins with M oore’s cross-country
book tour, and veers to the field trips he made
to down-sized corporations that affected people all
over America.
One of the first stops is a book signing in St.
Louis. Moore made his first detour from the tour to
Centralia, 111., where the workers at the Payday candy
factory were about to lose their jobs. Moore spoke
with the departing workers, and made attempts to get
inside the factory on it’s last day open. Unfortunately,
company representatives were reluctant to make a
statement while his cameras were on.
Moore was back in St. Louis last month for a
screening of “The Big One,” and he spoke to some of
the Centralia workers who attended.
“My dad didn’t live with this kind of fear ... The
■ social contract then was, if you worked hard and the
company did well, he did well. That was it, right? The
American dream. And now, up in Centralia, you work
hard, the company prospers, and you lose your job.
That’s the new equation,” Moore said.
Moore’s biggest break and one of the film’s
highlights is the appearance of Nike CEO Phil Knight. For
some odd reason, Knight agreed to do an interview with
Moore with the cameras on. Moore attempted to get Knight
to travel to Indonesia to visit one of Nike’s factories.
Workers there are as young as 14 and get paid 40 cents per
hour. Knight declined.
Moore had hoped Knight was different than many
of the CEOs he had been after. “Underneath the veneer
of hipness lies the same “no amount is enough” greed
and disdain for working fam ilies that one finds in
Knight's older, buttoned-down, clean-shaven colleagues,”
Moore said.
After the film was screened, Knight attempted to have
Moore take two portions out. Moore declined, but said he
would add a scene of Nike breaking ground on a shoefactory in Flint. Ground has yet to be broken.
Miramax will give half of the profits of “The Big One”
to the people of Flint. $100,000 has already been advanced.
“I set out to make a funny, entertaining and hopefully
enlightening movie about what I saw on my trip across
America. Ultimately I hope it will give people a chance to
have a good cathartic laugh, and know they’re not alone,
that however good things are for corporations, most
Americans are just like them, still working longer hours for
less pay, still living in fear of being downsized ... I hope
that people leave the theatres laughing and shaking their
fists, not in despair, but in outrage,” Moore said.
“The Big One” opens at the Tivoli Theatre in
St. Louis tomorrow.

Everybody has an Oscar Madison or a Felix

Neil Simon’s ‘‘Odd Couple II”; not only can you

together, but you can escape for two hours from your
Felix or Oscar.
Thirty years ago, the original “Odd Couple”
debuted with Walter Matthau as Oscar and Jack
Lemmon as Felix. Felix had just been kicked out of
his house by his wife and he moved in with pal Oscar.
Felix is a picky neat-freak and Oscar is a laid-back
slob. They spend much of the movie verbally abusing
one another, but staying friends in the long run.

the latest ones have had the two bickering at each
other “Odd Couple” style. Is the magic still there?
Yes, and no. Those who enjoy the curse-laced
bickerings of the duo will be pleased with the sequel,
but die-hard fans of the original, and Simon
afficionados, may be a bit disappointed.
The story opens with Oscar living in California
semi-retired. He gets a call from his son who tells
him that he is marrying Felix’s daughter. Oscar and
Felix are reunited and they plan on traveling to the
wedding together. Of course, it’s no easy trip and
they end up getting arrested three times.
The story is decent, but the sharp wit of Simon

Batters up fo r Cougar ball

Cougar pitching is “bread and butter” for SIUE baseball
■ BY JASON TRIPLETT
STAFF REPORTER
The Cougar baseball team is
definitely capable of producing
runs, but head coach’Gary Collins
is convinced pitching is still the
team’s bread and butter.
After a five-game home stand
in which SIUE took on two
conference
contenders,
the
Cougars had won four out of the
five games and manufactured 41
runs. The 4-1 loss to the
University of Missouri-St. Louis
on April 1 is what has coach
Collins worried.
‘'We can’t keep producing the
runs we have consistently,”
Collins said. "Our pitching is
coming around, I think, and
hopefully we can start supporting
our pitching with our hitting.”
In the homestretch, pitcher
Ryan Cox threw two full games
and senior Rob LaMarsh pitched a
complete game.
“I felt like Rusty Sarnes,
Ryan Cox and Rob LaMarsh all
had good stuff through the
stretch,” Collins said. "They
didn’t look fatigued, and going
the distance gives positive signs
of improvement.”
Without strong pitching, the
Cougars could get finessed out of
a few games. Collins believes that
good pitching can overrule strong

hitting any day. In the loss to
UMSL, Shane Brannan held the
Cougars to five hits, fanned eight
SIUE
batsmen
and
held
the home team to just one run.
This type of performance could
leave Collins’ team reeling,
especially going deeper into the
season.
The
Cougars
are
averaging 13.7 runs a game and it
has brought the Cougars to a 21-8
record this season.
In the four other games of
last weeks series, SIUE played

like the productive run-scoring
machine
from
which
it
occasionally veers. In the second
game
against
UM SL
last
Thursday, SIUE put the bats in
harmony and tallied 13 hits in the
11-2 victory. Home runs by center
fielder Mark Briggs, pitcher
LaMarsh and a five run fourth
inning for the Cougars set UMSL
back in their GLVC South
Division 2nd place seat until they
meet again.
After a thirteen hit game

against UMSL, the Cougars came
back for an encore performance.
In the doubleheader on Saturday
against
the
GLVC
South
Division’s third ranked Kentucky
Wesleyan College, the lucky hit
number again was 13. Second
baseman Mark Bugger hit a
perfect 2-2 while Briggs and
shortstop Mike Robertson each
went 2-4 from the plate in the 102 first game victory.

Briggs,
LaMarsh and catcher Ryan

Collings kept KWC in check
through nine innings in Sat­
urday’s second game. In addition,
four .500 or above performances
by the Cougar bats made the
9-5 victory too much for KWC
pitching
tandem
of
Matt
Fitzsimmons, who pitched six
and two-thirds innings, and
Chris Skeeters who finished up
the game.
Left fielder M ason Horne
helped SIUE to two 5-run innings
by tagging a home run with three
RBIs in Sunday’s 10-3 series
closer. Jason Seivert went 3-4
from the designated hitter spot
and has been on fire lately.
“M ark Bugger and Jason
Seivert have been leading lately,”
Collins said. “Mark is playing like
a veteran, not a freshman, and
Seivert leads the team in batting
average.”
Collins is hoping to round out
the Cougars by improving in the
lacking areas. SIUE faces two
more conference foes this
weekend and travels to the
University of Wisconsin Parkside
on Friday and then to St. Joseph’s
College on Saturday.
“I
have
seen
some
improvement
in
pitching,”
Collins said. “Our fielding isn’t
exactly where I like it. We need to
see if we can get better to balance
our game.”

Solid pitching helps Cougar softball get job done, team
improves record to 29 - 15 after win over Missouri-St. Louis

Sports Column: Triplett ponders, “Sports greats or sports greedies?”
■ BY JASON
TRIPLETT
STAFF
REPORTER
If I was paid
m illions
of
Jason
dollars to put a
Triplett
round
inflated
b all through a
hoop, hit a tightly wound ball
with a wooden stick, or make a
p
i
e
c
e
of pigskin fly through the air
into a team m ate’s arms, I would
treat my body and my career
like the golden meal ticket that

it is paid to be.
In the past few years, more
professional athletes have faced
drug, assault and other charges
while they are being paid for
their image, their body and their
mind. O f course, I am not
including all o f the athletes in
professional sports when I say
that they aren ’t taking their
careers
seriously.
But there are those who know
what kind of money they make,
know the reasons why and still
abuse the very source of their
substance.
A professional athlete’s
image is one that, depending on

the athlete, can be a huge benefit
or burden. It doesn’t matter if an
athlete wants to be a role model
or not. They are not role models
by their own choice, but by the
fans choice. A fan chooses to
idolize someone, the idol doesn’t
choose the fans.
Image is such an important
part of some athlete’s lives that
it has the population thinking
some athletes are superhuman.
Take
M ichael
Jordan
for
instance.
His
accum ulated
w ealth
from
his
many
endorsements earned Michael his
own clothing company. It has
been said that Michael can fly.

Image is everything.
A professional athlete’s
body is the key to his paycheck.
If a superstar’s body doesn’t
work then what good is the
superstar? How can an athlete
use drugs and still expect his
body to be up to par. He/she
can’t. Drugs put your body at a
deficiency somewhere whether it
be mentally, physically or
chemically. In my opinion, an
athlete needs improvement from
college to professional play, and
the use of drugs hinders the
athlete’s ability to improve.
Professional sports have

become mentally challenging in
the ‘90s. W hether to make a pass
or not, to hit the gap or hug the
line, to take the shot or give it up.
The mental game is as important
as the physical game and you can
get into som eone’s head as easily
as you can hurt their body if they
aren’t in the finest shape.
Come on guys. What you
did in college is what you did in
college. You get paid to play a
game. The least you can do is
respect it. A profession is called
professional because you live it.
That’s why it isn't called a job.

UMN football player pleads innocent to charges
A LBU Q U ERQ U E,
N.M.
(AP) — Ryan Taylor, one of the
best defensive players on New
M exico’s bowl team last season,
pleaded innocent to charges he
hit and choked his girlfriend.
Taylor did not attend a hearing
Monday before M etropolitan
Court Judge Theresa Gomez. His
attorney, Frank Sedillo, entered a
not guilty plea on his behalf.
The 21-year-old sophomore

spent Sunday night in jail on
charges of aggravated battery and
false im prisonm ent and is
currently free on a $12,500 bond.
According to a police report,
Taylor’s girlfriend said she and
Taylor began arguing after they
left an Albuquerque dance club
early Sunday m orning. The
woman told police that Taylor hit
her with an open hand while she
was driving and later at Taylor’s

apartm ent “choked her five
different tim es.”
The woman called police after
leaving Taylor’s apartment and
going home.
Reached
by
telephone
Monday,
Taylor
told
the
Albuquerque Journal, “ I’d love
to tell you all about it, but
I can’t.”
Lobos coach Rocky Long said
Taylor has been placed on a leave

of absence but rem ained a
m em ber o f the team. Long
refused to discuss what he
would do if the allegations were
proven true.
“I think every situation is
different,” Long said. “He told
me he was going to plead
innocent. You have to let the legal
system
work
to
a
final
conclusion, and you have to
make a judgm ent on each

individual case.”
Taylor played defensive end
last season and led the Lobos and
the Western Athletic Conference
in sacks with 11. He was a leader
on a New Mexico team that won
the M ountain Division of the
WAC
and
went
to
the
Insight.com Bowl, losing 20-14
to Arizona.

Wizards players Howard, Weber investigated on sexual assault allegations
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Juwan H ow ard and Chris
Webber, both former standouts at
Michigan, are being investigated
for an alleged sexual assault
against a woman during a party at
H ow ard’s suburban M aryland
home, authorities said Monday.
Investigators
at
the
M ontgomery
C ounty police
department searched the homes of
the two teammates after a woman
detailed the allegations in a call to
authorities early Monday, police
spokesman George Luddington
said. No charges were filed.
Police also are interviewing
people at the party who may have
witnessed the alleged incident.
Billy Martin, an attorney for
Howard, said on WTTG-TV in
Washington no w arrants were
pending for his client. Howard
described the allegation as “a big

rfto L L y w o o d

distraction” and told the station
“I ’m speechless about it.”
Following a Monday morning
practice, Webber told WUSA-TV
in Washington that “no police
have contacted m e.”
Both players, members of
Michigan’s Fab Five teams that
made consecutive NCAA finals
appearances, are in Chicago,
where the Wizards are scheduled
to play the Bulls on Tuesday
night. Luddington said authorities
would probably w ait for the
players to
return
to
the
W ashington
area
before
interviewing them.
Webber was arrested Jan. 20
by police in Prince G eorge’s
County, Md., another Washington
suburb, and
charged
with
speeding, assaulting a police
officer
and
possession
of
marijuana. He is awaiting trial.

Rams, Bears eye Cardinals’ NO. 3 pick but question its cost
PHOENIX (AP) — St. Louis
and Chicago covet the Arizona
C ardinals’ No. 3 pick in the
coming draft but d o n ’t like
the price.
The Cardinals gave up their
second-place slot to San Diego
last month in exchange for the
third, plus a second-round pick,
a No. 1 in 1999 and two players.
The Rams, who pick sixth,

and the Bears, who pick fifth,
confirmed they have approached
the Cardinals about a trade,
though the Cardinals declined to
comment, The Arizona Republic
said Tuesday.
But Rams coach
Dick
Vermeil said he doubted the
Cardinals really w ere very
interested and certainly would
be so only on their terms.

“M oving to the third spot
looks like an improbability to
me because of the asking price,”
Vermeil said. “We used a third,
fourth (and seventh) last year to
move from No. 6 to No. 1, and
they want much, much more
than that for us to move from six
to three.
“I believe personally they
don’t want to trade, but if they

get what th ey ’re asking for,
they’ll do it,” Vermeil added,
though he w ouldn’t say what the
Cardinals had demanded.
Both the Bears and the Rams
have their eyes on Florida State
defensive end Andre Wadsworth
— as do the Cardinals.
Bears officials said they also
have discussed a trade with the
Rams. If the Rams move up that

one slot, they expect to draft
Penn State running back Curtis
Enis, the Republic said.
M eanw hile, the C ardinals
said Monday they have signed
punter Scott Player, who had
brief stints with the New York
G iants and the New York
Jets since being cut by the
Cardinals after training cam p
two years ago.

Mayor, county judge urge negotiations for new arena
HOUSTON (AP) — The
Harris County-H ouston Sports
A uthority
should
begin
negotiating with the H ouston
Rockets on a new arena for the
National Basketball A ssociation
team, two top officials say.
Mayor Lee Brown and Harris
County Judge R obert Eckels
urged
M onday
that
the

negotiations
be
pushed
follow ing a m eeting with
Rockets owner Leslie Alexander.
Alexander and an entourage
of supporters met separately
M onday with Brown and
Eckels in hopes of getting a
referendum before county voters
this August.
Both leaders
said
that

A lexander’s timetable may be
too optimistic, but both said the
sports authority should begin
negotiating a deal with the team.
Brown said he will spend the
“next few days” speaking with
people in the com m unity to
determ ine if the referendum
would pass.
“Obviously, (a referendum )

could be done that quickly —
that’s not the issue,” Brown said.
“You want to make sure that
when we do it, it’s a successful
vote of the public.
“My sense is that the people
of Houston love the Rockets just
as I love the Rockets, and they
want the Rockets to be
competitive with a new arena.”
‘I don’t know any reason why

Knee injury may end football
season for FSU’s Kendra
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP)—
Dan Kendra, Florida State’s
starting quarterback, may be lost
for the 1998 season after tearing
the anterior cruciate ligament in
his right knee in an intra-squad
scrimmage.
The injury leaves Florida state
with only one healthy scholarship
quarterback, sophomore Chris
Weinke. Sophomore Marcus
Outzen was knocked out of spring
practice last month when he
separated his right shoulder.
Florida State coach Bobby
Bowden said Kendra, a 22-yearold
junior,
will
undergo
reconstructive surgery Thursday.

Doctors will determine then how
long he’ll be out.
“I’m just disappointed as
heck,” Bowden said Sunday. “I
had really hoped it wouldn’t be
that bad.”
Kendra, a prized high school
recruit three years ago out of
Bethlehem, Pa., was injured when
he was tackled by linebacker
Bradley Jennings in the third
period of Saturday’s spring game.
The 6-foot, 240 pound, Kendra
was poised to take over the
starting slot after throwing for
1,006 yards and 12 touchdowns as
Thad Busby’s backup the past
two years.

Kendra and Weinke were not
given any special treatment
Saturday and found themselves
dodging one of the nation’s
toughest defenses.
“We really think that’s the only
way they can get better,” Bowden
said. “It’s a game of risk. I’m so
sorry it happened to Dan.”
After Kendra’s injury Bowden
immediately put a green shirt
on Weinke to ensure he wouldn’t
be hit.
Kendra already has used a redshirt year and the injury may cost
him one of his two remaining
years of eligibility.
