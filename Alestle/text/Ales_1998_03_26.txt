he found the fair a little
disappointing because he felt
that it was geared m ostly at

National STD’s Awareness Month is dedicated to HPV
■ BY RENEE D.

NEWS REPORTER
As April is National Sexually
Transmitted Disease Awareness
Month, the American Social
Health Association is urging
people to become more educated
about all STDs, especially human
papillomavirus (HPV), an STD
that is very common yet often
undiagnosed due to it’s lack of
symptoms.
“Because
HPV
is
extremely com m on and often
symptomless,
education
is
essential for early detection and
treatment,” said Linda Alexander,
ASHA president and chief
executive officer.
“That is why we are
dedicating this year’s National

SAVAGE_____________
from page 11

It sounds pretty frightening.
Yeah, and the paper boy, that’s true. All of
it. It’s so sad.
What a demented childhood.
Yeah, but I got to make a movie out of it.
So, what makes you so savage?
You know what, there’s not much. I’m
pretty pathetic, and a huge wuss. When I was
a kid, I was playing soccer, and I kicked a kid
in the teeth. I didn’t mean to. For some reason
someone called me that. Then all the kids
started calling me that.
It stuck, when I was probably eight years
old. When I started making movies, I thought
it would help people not confuse me with
other Steve’s, like Spielberg.
What do you think of the attempts to
revive the wacky ‘80s comedy like Adam
Sandler tries to do?
Oh, I think it’s so funny. Did you see “The
Wedding Singer?”
Yeah.
Did you think it was really hysterical?
I thought it was really funny.
Okay, I was really loving it, and I had just
seen “Happy Gilmore.” ... You want to think
in your little sick world that you're ahead of
your time by doing those kind of stupid things
that I got destroyed for doing.
My first review was in “People” magazine
by Peter Travers, w ho now works for
“Rolling Stone.” And I open this thing up, and

A l e s i l e

I was having the happiest year of my life. It
was a dream come true. I was 24, I had just
met with all these great people ... Peter
Travers basically said, “If you see Savage
Steve Holland, please kill him because he’s
better off dead.” And it just went on. It was
like I made “Caligula.”
W hen you released “One Crazy
Summer,” were you worried that people
might construe it as a sequel?
In some ways it kind of was. We did
“Better Off Dead,” and I had the most fun I
ever had in my life. I got together the same
crew and pretty much the same cast, because
we were just so happy.
W hen we were making “Better Off Dead,”
we were out in the snow and the rain. But,
everyone was happy. So, I said, if everything
works, I was going to take everybody to my
favorite place which is Nantucket Island, and
w e’re going to make another movie, and I
didn’t even have a script.
Have you thought about doing another
project with John Cuscak?
John’s not very happy with me. He hated
“Better Off Dead” to be honest with you. I
just never understood it, but he hated it. And
this is a really sad story, but I’ll tell you.
I think John’s about the coolest guy that
lives. Shamefully, when we screened “Better
Off Dead” for the same people who were
making “One Crazy Summer,” we were on
day one of shooting. John just walked out and
said, “That was the worse piece of sh*t movie
I ’ve ever seen.” He didn’t even watch it. He

T h u rsd a y , M a r c h 26, 1998 ♦

watched like fifteen minutes of it. He was just
miserable during “One Crazy Summer.” He
was in it, but he wasn’t really in it. It’s so sad,
because I think “Better Off Dead” is one of
his best things
I didn’t know how much it bothered him
until he told me, and then it was like a
girlfriend breaking up with you ... I had this
career heart bubble thing that was protecting
my heart and when John said, “Fu*k you, I
hate you!” that popped. I was like a wet
sock with meat in it for a summer. It’s
really pathetic.
Do you have a favorite type of gag that
you like to use?
Oh my God, I’m so embarrassed, but I
think anybody falling out of screen getting
hurt is really keen. That just never seems
to fail.
How did your interest in animation
start?
I always did that because making films
was so expensive... I had three cats that die in
a row. One jumped out of a hotel room
window. It was horrible. Then about two
weeks later I got another one, and a hawk
took it. It was flying away, and you could
almost hear it say, “I can see my house from
here.” Poor little kitty. And the third one was
Eek, and he drank this antifreeze from my car.
And he was just lying there in this cute little
cat position hard as a rock
So I made this little Christmas story about
him and went to the guys at Fox. ... I didn't
have to eat out the dumpster anymore.

I’ve been told one time or
another that 1 w asn't pretty

cool enough (whatever that
means) to make it. I was told
by several people I would
become pregnant and drop out of
college. I was told I was wasting

they were crazy. All the people
who said those things were at

I know that stress comes in

hardly anyone was writing
editorials for the page. I was (and
1 am still) carrying a full course
load, and the long nights that
often
result
from
little
encouragem ent from others,
doesn't seem to be helping the
paper And as strong as I think I
am, I don’t think I would have
made it without the people that

if I wanted to quit, they told me
that I wouldn't quit for anything
in the world. And they were
right. I love this far too much
to quit.
I never could quit anything. 1
was always the person that had to
get thrown out. If I made up my
mind to be somewhere, I was the
person that was staying.
And just when I thought I
was going to go insane, many of
my fellow students told me that
they were actually reading my
column and enjoying it. I was
shocked. I never really expected
anyone to pay it any mind, but
several people have proved me
otherwise.

Letters to the editor
Ignored Harmony

Saving Our Inner Cities

It is a shame that at the past three
Pathways to Harmony programs there has
been, at the most, only two members of the
school body present. This program is
offered for students so they may learn to
celebrate the similarities and differences
that exist within each one of us. It is
terrible that a program which is supposed
to help students learn to live in harmony
has been so poorly supported by the same
people that cry for change.
The only way that people are ever
going to learn how to get along as a human
race is for them to make the effort to
change. This first step can be made if
students support a program that is geared
toward teaching them that we are much
more similar than we ever are different. If
you look around this campus you will find
that success comes when people work
together.
A student that is aware of cultural
backgrounds is better able to deal with the
ever-changing diversity occurring within
this country. A student that gains this
knowledge while in a campus setting will
be better prepared for continued success
upon graduation. I urge every student to
think about who he/she will be working
with once their career has begun. Chances
are it will not be a person just like you. The
time to prepare is now and SIUE gives you
the opportunity...the next step is up to you.

College students and professors
frequently express concerns over the
deplorable conditions found in many of
America’s inner cities. Although many
members of academia agree that problems
exist in large cities, there is little
agreement over possible solutions. Some
propose that increased governm ent
expenditures and social program s are
the only ways to reduce poverty,
racism and crime. Others (m yself
included), think that most government
programs are detrimental to society in the
long run and that individual determination
is the key to success.
On Wednesday, April 15 at 7:30 p.m.,
SIUE students faculty and members of the
general public will have the opportunity to
hear how freedom can save our inner
cities. Those who attend a lecture by
Reginald Jones entitled, “Why Puff Daddy
is a Capitalist,” will hear how the current
United States tax code encourages people
to trade hard work for the dole. Attendees
will also learn other examples of how
government programs and regulations are
causing more harm than good for inner
city residents.
In addition to providing a discussion
of the causes of inner city strife, Mr. Jones
will also advocate free market solutions to
the aforementioned problems. Mr. Jones
will present his views regarding the
positive effects of tax cuts and reductions
in government regulations, which prevent
America’s poor from joining the work

wealth. If inner city residents are to use
their intellect and ability to becom e
successful, our nation must work to move
the governm ent imposed barriers that
prohibit and encourage people from
finding and maintaining employment. This
country should concentrate a great deal of
effort toward reducing taxes, minimizing
incentives to avoid work, and ending
regulations that stifle innovation. Although
the ultimate key to success is individual
perseverance, public officials must make
major policy changes if our inner cities are

Parking made simple
For years I have read commentaries
on the current situation involving parking
here at SIUE and dismissed them as being
diatribe without offering any solutions to
the problem. During the cold snap we had,
I spent many frigid moments debating how
the nniversity could improve parking
relations with the students and came up
with the following suggestions.
Get rid of the color coded lots. Make
all the lots “first come, first serve.” To
begin with, science and art majors have to
walk across a county to get to their
buildings. Sure, on lovely spring days this
might be fun, but when it is cold, rainy.

The Alestle is published on Tuesdays and Thursdays
during fall and spring semesters, and on Wednesdays
during summer semesters. For more information, call

snowy or sleeting (or all of the above),
it blows.
If the coler coded lots stay, put the
staff in the red lots. As with most
consumer oriented businesses, the faculty
and staff should have to park in the farthest
lot from their building. Hell, we are
paying the faculty and staff’s salary and
paying for our tuition. If parking services
insist on the color coded lots, everyone
should have to enter a lottery to get one of
the better stickers.
There will be the people (mostly
parking services) who say that these ideas
are impossible. To begin with there will be
lost revenue because stickers for the better
lots cost more. With my “first come, first
serve proposal” it would be easy to
average the sticker prices out and simply
raise the cost a few dollars. It hasn’t been
a problem raising sticker prices $20 at a
time, what would a few extra dollars cost.
Another lost revenue source would be
the money generated from parking
violations. This one is easy, fire your ticket
givers or reassign them to a more fruitful
task, such as beating anyone that tries to
paint the defenseless rock in the middle
of campus.

Grandparents find three girls dead in bed
DALY CITY, Calif. (AP) —
A m other used duct tape to
suffocate her three little girls,
leaving two notes discussing her
plans and then taking a non-lethal
dose of prescription drugs, police
said today.
“She suffocated those three
kids,” said police Lt. Steve Lowe.
“She did it to them one at a time.”
Megan K. Hogg, 25, was
booked into jail M onday evening
for investigation of three counts
of homicide, then was taken for
psychiatric evaluation, sheriff’s

Sgt. Steve Shively said.
Hogg was being held without
bail in the deaths of Antoinette
Marden, 7, Angelique Roberts, 3,
and Alexandra Hogg, 2, whose
grandparents found their bodies
at about 6:30 a.m. Monday.
Lowe said authorities are
devastated by the incident.
“It takes about five minutes to
suffocate someone,” Lowe said.
“Multiply that by three.”
Fire and em ergency crews
rushed to the scene, carrying the
girls to the front lawn one by one

and trying without results to
revive them.
Hogg was found unconscious
and was taken to Seton Medical
Center. Police declined to say
why she had been hospitalized,
but San Mateo County Coroner
Bud Moorman said that she was
treated for an overdose of several
prescription drugs.
Rescue crews initially said the
girls, whose bodies showed no
signs of trauma, appeared to have
died from carbon monoxide
p o i s o n i n g . But pol i ce

investigators quickly disputed
that report, saying the deaths
were suspicious.
“A preliminary determination
by our investigation indicates
there might be foul play,” police
Sgt. Matt Bushong said Monday.
Results of autopsies were
expected later in the day.
Moorman said Monday he was
“puzzled” as to the cause
of death.
“It could be anything,”
he said.
He said the color of the bodies

was normal, w hich is “not
consistent” with asphyxiation or
carbon monoxide poisoning.
As officials rem oved the
bodies from the home, friends
tried to comfort distraught family
members.
“There’s a lot of crying right
now,” said one neighbor, who
identified herself as Michelle. “It
makes you a little scared. Three
little girls — I’ve got two little
kids of my own.”

Chicago tra n s it companies seek grant to provide help
CHICAGO (AP) — Two
Chicago-area
m ass
transit
companies are seeking a federal
grant to help connect welfare
recipients with job opportunities.
Most welfare recipients, who
are being thrust into the job
market by the federal welfare-towork law, live in inner-city
neighborhoods, according to an
analysis
by
the
Urban
Transportation Center at the
University of Illinois-Chicago,

and as many as 75 percent of
them don’t have cars. Two-thirds
of the metropolitan area’s job
openings are in the suburbs.
So Pace, the suburban bus
company, and the Chicago
Transit Authority teamed up to
apply for a $5.4 million federal
grant that would finance special
CTA passes and a fleet o f Pace
vans to help welfare recipients
get to work.
“What businesses tell us is

that they want to hire individuals
who are ready to go to work, are
qualified and can get there,” said
Mary Pepperl, president of the
Workforce Development Council
o f N orthern Cook County, a
private industry group that tries
to connect em ployers with
workers. “They don’t care if they
are former welfare recipients.”
If the federal grant is
approved, the CTA would
subsidize trips to and from work
for former welfare recipients in

their
second
month
of
commuting. Those who stay on
the job for six months would get
free transportation for a month.
Pace hopes to use the money

Florida executes
man for murder
of police officer
STARKE, Fla. (AP) — Leo
Jones, who had challenged the
constitutionality of Florida’s use
of a 75-year-old electric chair,
died there today for the sniper
murder of a police officer.
Jones’ attorneys objected after
the fiery death of another inmate
in March 1997. The problem had
led to a nearly yearlong halt in
executions in Florida, which
ended Monday. Jones’ execution
was the second of four scheduled
over nine days.
There was no visible flame
today; Jones was pronounced
dead at 7:11 a.m. He was
condemned for the 1981 slaying
of Thomas Szafranski, who was
shot in the head while sitting in
his patrol car in downtown
Jacksonville.
“In the hearts of all us, it’s
long overdue,” Thomas Pialorsi,
who was president o f the
Jacksonville Fraternal Order of
Police when Szafranski was shot,
said Monday.
Jones, 47, confessed to the
shooting, but he later said the
confession was coerced by police
who beat him.
In his appeals, he noted the
statements of a dozen people who
said another man had confessed
to the killing. Jones’ appeal for a
stay to the Florida Supreme Court
and a separate appeal to a federal

judge were rejected Monday.
Serial killer Gerald Stano died
Monday for the murder of a 17year-old girl from Port Orange in
1973. He had confessed to
41 killings.
Judy Buenoano, 54, the
“Black Widow,” is scheduled to
be executed next Monday for the
murder of her husband. Twentyfour hours later, the state plans to
execute Daniel Remeta, 40, for
the 1985 fatal shooting o f Mehrle
Reeder, a convenience store clerk
in Ocala.
Remeta also has two murder
convictions in Kansas, which he
is currently trying to have set
aside in an apparent attempt to
escape the death penalty in
Florida. The Kansas case stems
from a 1985 crime spree which
included the killings of two men
after they
were
abducted
in Levant.
After flames up to a foot long
burst from behind the mask
covering the face o f Pedro
Medina, last year, electrocutions
were halted in Florida for failed
appeals and a debate on whether
use of “Old Sparky” was cruel
and unusual punishment.
In 1990, a sponge in the
headpiece caught fire during the
death of Jesse Tafero. That also
led to a tem porary halt in
executions.

Arbitrator clears officer a third time in riot
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP)
Police Officer James Knight did
nothing wrong when he shot and
killed a black teenage motorist,
touching off disturbances in fall
1996, an arbitrator ruled.
And because Knight did not act
improperly, he should not have
been suspended for 60 days, the
arbitrator said.
The decision by George Ives,
made public Monday, means the
city must give the patrol officer
two months’ worth of back pay.
And the discipline notice in
Knight’s personnel file must be
removed.
“I now hope that this matter can
be placed in the past for me, for
the citizens of St. Petersburg and
for those who judged me without
knowing all of the facts,” Knight

read from a prepared statement at
his attorney’s office.
This was the third time Knight
has been cleared in the Oct. 24,
1996 shooting, which sparked
burning and looting in swaths of
predominantly black south St.
Petersburg. A second night of
unrest broke out Nov. 13 after
Knight was cleared by a grand
jury. The U.S. Department of
Justice also has exonerated him.
The
National
People’s
Democratic Uhuru Movement, a
frequent critic of the city’s police
departm ent,
criticized
the
arbitrator’s
ruling.
Omali
Yeshitela,
the
m ovem ent’s
founder, said it was another
indication “the system does not
give much value to black life.”
“It’s simply a means by which

F R JE E E v e n in g s Jk W

the system has sent the message
out to the police, and anyone
else, that it is perm issible to
kill young black people,”
Yeshitela said.
Knight shot and killed TyRon
Lewis, 18, after the 1980 Pontiac
LeMans that Lewis was driving
was stopped for speeding. The
doors were locked, Lewis
wouldn’t come out, and Knight
couldn’t see through the darkly
tinted side windows.
When Knight stepped in front
of the car to get a better look
through the windshield, Lewis
jerked the car toward him several
times, at one point knocking

Defense seeks mistrial in sex torture case
NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for a Columbia
University microbiology student accused in a sex torture
case demanded a mistrial because of the judge’s alleged
hostility.
Defense lawyer Jack Litman asked Acting Justice
William Wetzel on M onday to declare a mistrial “given
the increasingly hostile attitude your honor displays
toward me in front of the jury.”
"That motion is denied,” Wetzel responded. “I’m not
going to hear that.”
The alleged victim was testifying Monday about
ambiguous e-mail messages she had written to defendant
Oliver Jovanovic when defense lawyer Fred Sosinsky told
the judge she was lying and that the prosecutor knew it.
Sosinsky was referring to her replies to questions about
whether any o f her e-mail messages showed an interest in
sadomasochistic sex or bondage and domination games.
She said they did not.

The alleged victim, a 22-year-old senior at Barnard
College, was the- first witness against 31-year-old
Jovanovic, a doctoral candidate she met in an America
Online chat room.
Jovanovic is on trial in M anhattan’s State Supreme
Court, charged with kidnapping, sodomy, aggravated sex
abuse and assault o f the woman in his apartment
following their first date Nov. 22, 1996.
Sosinsky asked Wetzel to allow the defense to crossexamine the woman about e-mails and aspects of her sex
life that the judge so far has excluded from the trial.
Wetzel denied the request.
The judge has ruled that many of the e-mails between
the alleged victim and Jovanovic, and material about the
woman’s sexual history, would violate the state’s rape
shield law if admitted as evidence.
Wetzel warned defense lawyers that he would find
them in contempt of court if they mentioned anything in

open court that he has decided is protected under the rape
shield law.
“Is it your honor’s ruling that a witness can get upon
the witness stand and intentional lie in front of the jury?”
Sosinsky asked. He asked Wetzel to hear his petition in
open court and the judge ordered him into chambers.
Under Litm an’s questioning, the woman said she
waited several days after the experience with Jovanovic
before seeking medical attention.
She said she did not protest when Jovanovic ordered
that she remove her clothes, and did not complain when
he tied her to a bed before what she said was 20 hours of
sexual torment.
Before she escaped, the woman testified, Jovanovic
tied her up, dripped hot candle wax on her abdomen and
genital area, bit her breasts until they bled, and beat and
probed her private parts with a nightstick.
The defense says everything that occurred was by
mutual consent.

Teacher who continued in classroom despite cancer dies at 38
SAUK RAPIDS, Minn. (AP)
For one o f his last public
outings, Dennis Frederick went
to the girls’ state basketball
tournament to watch the Sauk
Rapids-Rice High School team
play. The elem entary school
teacher told people he did not
want to miss the game.
“He was very inspirational
for the kids,” said Greg Vandal,
the superintendent for Sauk
Rapids schools.
Frederick gained national
attention when he continued to
teach after he got sick with
cancer. He died early Monday

morning at St. Cloud Hospital.
He was 38.
At Pleasantview Elementary
School, where Frederick taught
third-graders,
teachers
and
students
mourned,
making
buttons in Frederick’s memory.
“Certainly it was a sad day for
all of us; there’s no doubt about
that,” said Jean Clark, the
principal. “But w e’ve spent many
months preparing for this. We’ve
been grieving for Dennis for a
long time.”
Frederick, who grew up in
Chisholm , developed
colon
cancer in 1996. By May 1997, it

had spread to his liver and
doctors gave him six months to
live. Despite the prognosis, he
returned to his classroom last fall.
“He said to us from the very
start, if you don’t think I should
come back, I won’t come back,”
Vandal said. “Dennis gave us far
more than we’ve ever given him ”
Frederick was assigned a new
class last fall, along with a co­
teacher. He quit teaching in
November but continued to visit his
pupils and fellow teachers.
“I hope I’ve taught them a lot,
that you can be sick and still carry
on,” Frederick said last fall.

During one tearful school
discussion about his illness, a student
asked if he was afraid to die.
“Not right now,” Frederick
answered. “Since this cancer has
happened, it’s brought me closer
to God. And I know, for it says in
the Bible, that if you have a
relationship with Jesus Christ
you’re going to go to heaven.”
Though ill and in pain,
Frederick had said the last few
months of his life werejthe best.
“I’m as happy in my life as
I’ve ever been,” Frederick said.
He thought he would die in
November, but he held on in part

to watch the Sauk Rapids-Rice
High School g irls’ basketball
team play.
He entered the hospital for the
last time last Wednesday.
“I’m ready,” Frederick said
two weeks ago.
He leaves behind his wife,
Sandy, and two sons, Sam and
Andy.
His funeral is scheduled for
4:30 p.m. W ednesday at the
Mississippi Heights school.
Later this spring, students
plan to plant a tree in the
elementary school courtyard in
Frederick’s memory.

three times through the glass, hitting Lewis in the arm and chest.
The administration o f then Police Chief Darrel Stephens said
Knight violated department policy by failing to keep him self out

Concerns rem ain over proposed Army use o f fo re s t
LEESVILLE, La. (AP) — Plans to dig foxholes, set off
smoke bombs and have troops practice cross-country
vehicle maneuvers in Louisiana’s only national forest
need more study, environmental groups, recreationists and
landowners say.
The Army and U.S. Forest Service agreed to give them
more time, extending the deadline for public comments
about the Kisatchie National Forest proposals until
April 30.
Fort Polk wants to do more training on 45,000 acres in
the southernmost portion o f the forest’s Vernon Ranger
District, southeast of Leesville.
“As our only national forest, we must be very careful
with it,” said Bill Robertson, president of the Louisiana
Audubon Council. “The forest is only 600,000 acres total.
We think there is a cost to allowing the military
training in terms of decreased public access and natural
resources.”
The proposal lists five alternatives, including no
increase in training. The one preferred by the Army
and Forest Service w ould allow increased training
without live ammunition on a seasonal basis, among

other restrictions.
At all other times, the acreage would be open to
the public.
Noise levels and the impact on roads, soil, public
access, water, vegetation, safety and the endangered redcockaded woodpecker concern private landowners,
environmentalists and outdoor enthusiasts.
The option favored by the Army and Forest Service
takes pains to address those concerns, the agencies said at
public meetings this month.
“We don’t want to own or control the land,” said Col.
Ray Fitzgerald, Fort Polk deputy commander. “We want
to use it at certain times of the year.”
Parts of the area would be closed up to nine times a
year for military exercises of several days each, he said.
The Army would not close any public roads or remove
any plants.
Hillside bogs and other environmentally sensitive
areas would be marked and protected and noise buffer
zones observed, Fort Polk officials said.
“Basically, we need expanded use of this area to
provide more meaningful training for the units that train at

our Joint Readiness Training C enter,” Fort Polk
spokesman Dan Nance said.
Supporters of the expanded training include Leesville’s
business community, which notes the economic impact of
Fort Polk, and the G overnor’s M ilitary Advisory
Commission. Fort Polk employs more than 5,000 people.
“We do support Fort Polk. It is the No. 1 employer in
this area ... And its payroll affects not only Vernon Parish
but the entire state,” said Michelle Dowden of the Greater
Vernon Chamber of Commerce in Leesville.
“We do appreciate Kisatchie National Forest and the
tourism it brings. But we believe Fort Polk can be
accommodated without a negative impact on the forest.”
No decision has been made. In addition to the standstill
option, two give priority to the military and two, including
the one preferred by the Army and Forest Service,
emphasize multiple uses.
The Army and Forest Service will analyze all public
comments before making a recommendation to the
Kisatchie National Forest supervisor, who will have the
final say.
That decision is expected in June.

Panel rejects appointing prosecutor to probe police misconduct
NEW YORK (AP) — The
force formed after the alleged
police
attack
on
Haitian
im m igrant Abner Louim a has
rejected a proposal to have an
independent
prosecutor
investigate police m isconduct
cases, a panel member said today.
The 33-m em ber task force
instead recommends that a new
level of more highly paid patrol
officers be created and that a
monitor be appointed to review
the efficiency o f brutality
com plaint investigations, said
M ichael
M eyers,
executive
director of the New York Civil

Rights Coalition.
The task force’s final report is
being printed and distributed this
week. Meyers said he and New
York Civil Liberties Union head
Norman Siegel plan to issue a
dissenting report at a news
conference Wednesday.
“My view is that the majority
report is tepid,” Meyers said in a
telephone interview today. “The
difference between the majority
report and the minority report is
black and white. My view is that
the majority report is in fact a
whitewash.”

Times, which reported the panel’s
findings today, the report also
recommends requiring officers to
live in New York City and
increasing the punishm ent for
officers guilty of brutality. The
task force’s suggestions do not
have the force of law.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
appointed the panel after the
alleged attack on Louim a in
August and asked it to come up
with
recom m endations
that
would curb acts of police abuse.
But by mid-December, some task
force members, including Meyers
and Siegel, were accusing

Giuliani of abandoning the panel
and breaking prom ises about
funding and staffing.
Meyers said he, Siegel and
others pushed to recom m end
creating a special prosecutor’s
office at the state level — a
proposal opposed by Giuliani and
the police department. Such an
office would have the authority to
investigate allegations of police
corruption and brutality.
“The theory is that police
are too close to prosecutors,”
Meyers said. “People don’t have
confidence in the ability of local
prosecutors” to investigate police

misconduct.
He pointed to the fact that
Brooklyn
D istrict
Attorney
Charles J. Hynes welcomed a
federal takeover of the Louima
case. Four officers are charged
with beating Louima and two of
them are charged with sexually
assaulting him in a police station
bathroom. A fifth officer is
accused of helping cover up
the attack.
Federal takeover o f the
prosecution
shows
“there’s
something wrong with the local
prosecution of police,” Meyers
said.

\ h (k h c Q u e f t i v h *
iy Cncy Glutee

Savage
Steve
Holland
(pictured above with a drawing of
one of his menacing “cute and
fuzzy bunnies”) helped define the
‘80s teen comedy with wacky
flicks like “Better O ff Dead” and
“One Crazy Summer.”
His offbeat style, and addition
of demented anim ation, made
his films cult classics. Not
to mention they both starred
John Cusack.
Recently, H olland created
the animated program “Eek the
Cat” for the Fox network. On
Sunday, Savage’s latest effort,
“Safety
Patrol,”
will
be
showcased on “The Wonderful
World of Disney.”
The film, starring Leslie
Nielson, Curtis Armstrong and
“Weird” A1 Yankovic is equally as
wacky as H olland’s previous
forays into film.
What kind of comedies did
you watch while you were
growing up?
Woody Allen was my favorite.
Yeah, I’m not proud, but I just
love that stuff. It made my dad
laugh, and my dad was just a
crabby lawyer. So, if he would

laugh, I thought, “I’ve got to do
that kind o f stupid comedy.”
“Airplane.” ... Do you like that
kind of stuff?
Yeah, I like off the wall. It’s
good to relax to.
It is. W hat’s funny is, I made
“Better Off Dead” based on an
almost all, I know it sounds
absurd, true story. And, before
that I did this movie called “My
11-year-old Birthday Party,”
which was a true story about
when I had my 11-year-old
birthday party and nobody came,
except this really mean drunk
clown that called me “Mr.
Popular.” And he got really, really
drunk and he tried to pick up my
mom. It was just a hateful thing.
My sister would ring the doorbell
and go “Mom, they’re here.” And,
of course, nobody was there. And
so, I made this really sad movie,
and it went to this comedy festival
and everybody thought it was the
funniest movie ever made. And I
thought I was onto something if I
talk about my miserable love life
in “Better Off Dead.” And that’s
how I got that movie made.

Instead of heading to Florida
or somewhere else sunny for
spring break, twenty students and
four staff from SIUE volunteered
to travel to Vinita and White Oak,
Okla. to participate in the
Alternative Spring Break Service
Learning project with the Loyal
Shawnee Indian Tribe.
According to Warren Hawks,
business manager of the Loyal
Shawnee Tribe, the project’s goal
was to teach volunteers about
social, econom ic and cultural
issues
through
work
and
interaction with the tribal
community.
The student volunteers’ work
consisted of cleanup at the tribal
headquarters,
school,
and

The group also helped paint the

Nearly 25 years of song writing and performing
will be show cased Saturday, when Chris
Williamson and Tret Fure come to St. Louis. An
“Evening of Favorites,” chosen by fans will be
performed by the duo at Westport Playhouse.
Williamson and Fure have recorded nearly thirty
albums betw een them and their second
collaboration together, “Between the Covers,” was
released to acclaim last year. They have been
performing and sharing their lives together for over
fifteen years. T heir songs are full of spirit
and humor and have been lauded by fans like
Bonnie Raitt.
Raitt said their latest album was “a beautiful
celebration of Chris and Tret’s love for each other.
The deepening o f their commitment and artistry is
an inspiration to me.”

important lesson learned was that
of the Shawnee struggle to attain
everything they have today.
“We tried to teach the students
appreciation for the hard work we
do here,” Hawks said. “We’ve
had to work for everything and
we value those things more
because of the hard work to get
them.”

s e e SHAWNEE, page 2

Williamson began recording music in 1964, and
her record, “The Changer and the Changed,” is one
of the biggest selling independent releases of all
time. Williamson started an all women’s music
label, Olivia, in a time when women did not have
much power in the music industry.
Fure began her musical career at an early age,
writing songs for and touring with Spencer Davis.
She had a self-title release on MCA and opened for
such big name acts as Yes, Poco and The J. Geils
Band. Fure eventually left the mainstream industry
for the independent world of women’s music, where
she first met Fure.
Reserved seats for the event are available for
$22.50 at the Westport Playhouse box office. The
show begins at 7:15 p.m. with the St. Louis duo,
Girls with Guitars, opening. The show is being
produced by Amy Doll and Linda Serafini from
KDHX’s show “Out and Open.” The concert is a
benefit for KDHX and The Center.

W hat’s the deal
with the cougar?
‘I hope they don’t hurt
the kitty.”
-Charlene Adair
Fr., Art Education

LIFESTYLE EDITOR

Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta
attempt to fill theaters this weekend with
the 20 year re-release o f “Grease. ”

Could it be that a 20-year-old musical about ‘50s
high school life could push box office phenomenon
“Titanic” from its happy perch? That question will
be answered this weekend when “Grease” slides
onto movie screens across the nation.
Some might say this is unlikely, since highprofile films like “The Man in the Iron Mask” and
“Primary Colors” failed at sinking the mighty
ship. But, “Grease” has something they did not:
proven clout.
When first released in 1978, “Grease” earned
over $340 million worldwide. That doesn’t compare
with “Titanic’s” $1 billion dollar take. But in 1978,
the average movie ticket price was $3, and today’s
tickets cost about $7.
Fans have never grown tired of the music, either.
The soundtrack to “Grease” has sold over $20

million since released, and $1.2 million o f those
have been in the last two years.
O f course, “Grease” is available on home video.
But, so was “Star Wars” when it was re-released last
year, and it went on to gross over $130 million.
“The freaks who love ‘Grease,’ really love
‘Grease,’” said Dana Dresch, an SIUE senior.
The film also appeals to young people, who are
more likely than others to see a movie more than
once. Repeat viewing is a key to a film ’s success.
“Titanic” will most likely get a boost from its
large showing at the Academy Awards. But,
“Grease” has one other plus. It’s running time is
only about two hours, while “Titanic” runs about
three hours, fifteen minutes. “Grease” can be shown
at least twice more on one screen per day.

from page 10

So, do you find that your
movies are a kind of therapy for
yourself?
Absolutely, but I’m in film
jail now of course, because of
those movies. But, I sure had fun
doing them.
What exactly is film jail?
Well, that’s when you make
movies that aren’t successful and
you lose all your friends and
people are mean to you.
That's not good.
I know. That’s okay. I’m in jail
rehab right now. I’m in a halfway
house. But, I think I’m gonna
get out.
W hat’s with the penchant
you have with casting Curtis
Armstrong?
Oh, I just think he’s so
wonderful. When I was doing
“Better Off Dead” I had this
character of my best friend in
junior high school named Charles
Dumar. I saw Curtis in, oh God,

the Tom Cruise movie...
“Risky Business.”
Yeah, “Risky Business.” And I
said, “Oh my God, that’s exactly
like my friend Charles, except he
was older. Obviously, Curtis was
not going to play a high school
guy. So I put in the line where he
says, “I’ve been going to this
school for seven-and-a-half
years.” ... He’s cracked me up ever
since. For good luck, even though
I’m in film jail, I put him and
Taylor Negron in everything.
You say he’s your good luck
charm, yet you’re in film jail.
Did you ever think he might be
your bad luck charm?
That’s a really, really good
point. But, I don’t want to take the
chance. So, in “Safety Patrol,” I
got rid of Taylor and we’ll see
how that goes.
You say your characters are
based on real people. What do
the people in your life think of
those films?
No one’s mad at me. My
parents were a little shocked,

because the mom and dad in
“Better Off Dead” are my mom
and dad. My sister, in “One Crazy
Summer,” is that little girl. And
most of my friends are pretty
honored by it, even though its silly
stuff ... No one sued me or
anything, so I look at that as
pretty positive.
So who are Ricky and his
mother based on?
Gosh, you know what, if they
live where you are, I’m gonna die.
There was this kid across the
street from me ... God it’s gonna
be mean, but I gotta go for it. The
guy was the biggest dork who
ever lived. Oh gosh, I’m gonna
die. But, his name was Ricky
Smith, and his mom was Mrs.
Smith. And the thing was, she had
a daughter who was really foxy
and a slutty kid and it was the
most fu*ked up family in the
world. And they were our
neighbors and we loved them.
Because, they had to nail her door
shut and he was out crocheting.
He really crocheted.

“Dark Rapture,” the first full-length production
from the Non-Prophet Theatre Co. will debut
this weekend.
The play by Eric Overmeyer has a noir feel,
reminiscent of the popular crime dime novels of
the ‘40s.
The story involves Julia Gaines, a woman
ensconced with mystery concerning a fire, $7
million and a husband who may or may not be
deceased. Other oddball characters are added to the
mix, including terrorists, hitmen, femme fatales and
of course a lounge singer.
The Non-Prophets prom ise to keep their
quirky brand of hum or present throughout

their latest effort.
“Dark Rapture” is directed by SIUE theatre
instructor, Robert Mitchell, and the cast features
students from the university, as well as Non-Prophet
managing director. Kristen Wylder.
The play opens today and will run through
March 29, and then April 9-11. All performances are
at 8 p.m. Admission for “Dark Rapture” is $10,
except for tonight’s show which is a benefit for St.
Louis Children’s Hospital Burn Center. A donation
of $5 is suggested.
The show will be held in St. Louis at

Two Cougar wrestlers take All-American honors
■ BY BRIAN
ANDERSON
SPORTS REPORTER
The NCAA Division II
National Wrestling tournament
held in Pueblo, Colo, proved
to be a good grand finale for
the Cougars.
SIUE entered this rugged
tournament unranked in the
Coaches Top 20 poll, but came
away 18th out of 39 teams. North
Dakota State University was the
tournament champion while its
neighbor, South Dakota State,
finished second.
SIUE’s Jesse Montez, Titus
Taylor and Steve Brown were
only three of 40 w restlers to
gather from all over the country
with one common goal: to place
in the top eight and earn AllAmerican honors.

Sophomore Titus Taylor
found himself in the seventh
seed after not being ranked all
season and felt the pressure.
“I knew this tournament
was going to be real tough and I
was very nervous, but I just
knew I was one of the top
wrestler’s in my weight,” Taylor
said of the pressure packed
NCAA tournament.
Taylor opened the tournament
with a 13-10 victory over
Mike Mitchell, but fell to the No.
5 seed and returning champion
Greg Jackson of San Fransisco
State University, 7-3. Taylor
rebounded and decisioned Klaus
Alberts 9-6 and pinned the
No. 5 seed Troy Barbush to set
up a rematch with No. 2
Greg Jackson.
Taylor narrowed the margin
but lost 5-2 to finish fourth place

is the first to admit he is not

Cougar baseball swings to No. 6 in nation
■ BY BRETT LICATA
SPORTS REPORTER
A good showing in Ft. Myers,
Fla. over spring break and solid
Great Lakes Valley Conference
wins helped the SIUE baseball
team to a No. 6 national ranking.
The Cougars kicked off their
spring break with a pair of wins on
March 14. SIUE started with a
three-run first inning against North
Dakota State University and never
let up. Jesse Bugger homered
while pitcher Rob LaMarsh had 15
strikeouts to picked up the 5-1 win.
Against Stonehill College, the
Cougars went down 3-0 after the
first inning, but SIUE stormed
back to tie the game 7-7 in the top
of the ninth. In the top of the tenth,
pinch-hitter Jason Sievert sent a
three-run shot over the fence to
give SIUE the 10-7 victory. Jason
Guest struck out four in getting the
win.
Mark
Briggs,
Mike
Robertson and LaMarsh also went
deep
for
the Cougars.
On March 15, SIUE held on for
a 5-4 win over the University of
North Dakota. A three-run seventh
inning put the Cougars up by three

before North Dakota managed to
score two in the bottom of the
ninth to make it close. Ryan Cox
was the winning hurler and Guest
recorded his second save of the
year.
The following day, SIUE could
only manage a split in a
doubleheader with Stony Brook
College. The Cougars had only
five hits and couldn’t cross the
plate until the ninth inning.
Robertson and LaMarsh each had
a couple of hits in an 8-1 loss, but
SIUE came back with an
overwhelming 15-0 win in the
second game. The Cougars banged
out 16 hits and held Stony Brook
to only five. Junior Pete Kleeman
hurled 10 strikeouts and recorded
the shutout victory. The offense
was spurred by Mark Bugger, who
went 2 for 3 with a home run and
three RBIs. Sievert, Briggs and
Jesse Bugger each had a two RBI
game.
Following a loss to Rockhurst
College in their final game in
Florida, the Cougars dove into
GLVC action over the weekend.
Lewis University made the trip
down to Edwardsville on Sunday
for a doubleheader. SIUE came out

swinging with a five-run first
inning which proved to be enough.
Jesse Bugger went three for four
with three RBIs and LaMarsh
contributed two hits and two runs
scored. Cox pitched the complete
game striking out five.
SIUE poured on the offense
again in the second game against
Lewis. LaMarsh, Sievert and Mark
Bugger each had three hits and
combined for 10 RBIs in a 16-3
victory. LaMarsh also pitched six
innings
to
record
the win.
Aaron Rakere pitched seven
and a third innings of five hit ball
for SIUE to pick up the victory
against Western Illinois University
on Tuesday. Briggs, Robertson and
Mark Bugger all took the ball out
of the park in a 7-5 downing of
Western Illinois.
Results
from
yesterday’s
doubleheader with Oakland City
University weren't available by
press time. Pending the outcome in
those games, SIUE will have
added to their 14-4 record.
The Cougars will travel to
Louisville, Ky. this weekend
for
three
games
against
Bellarmine University.

S tudents, alum s jo in S tanford fin a l fo u r ce leb ratio n
STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — The surprise is over. Now
comes the anticipation of Stanford’s first Final Four
appearance in 56 years.
Scores of people turned out Monday at the Stanford
box office, snapping up tickets to this weekend’s Final
Four games in San Antonio in the aftermath o f the
Cardinal’s last-minute rally past Rhode Island in Sunday’s
Midwest Regional championship.
“If you’re Duke or North Carolina, Kentucky, you kind
of assume you’re going to go every few years. For
Stanford, this is almost a first-time thing and everyone is
going crazy,” student David Flemm ing said after
spending $100 for a ticket to the semifinals and title game.
Stanford overcame a six-point deficit in the final
minute to defeat Rhode Island 79-77 and advance to
Saturday’s meeting against Kentucky, which needed a
stirring comeback of its own to beat Duke 86-84 in the
South Regional final.
“We went from a feeling of, ‘Oh, no, we’re going to
lose this gam e,’ to a feeling of absolute elation,” Stanford
forward Mark Madsen said. “And Arthur Lee is the guy
who made it happen.” Lee extended the Cardinal’s season
by scoring 13 of his 26 points in the last 2:04.

While Stanford’s women’s team has six Final Four
trips and two national titles in the 1990s, the men’s team
endured a 47-year NCAA tournam ent drought after
winning the title in ‘42.
Though Stanford has gained entry six times in the last
10 years, “Somebody would have thought you’re a lunatic
if you said five years ago that Stanford would be in the
Final Four,” Flemming said.
Etheridge said the championship push by the men’s
team helped ease the sting of the Stanford women’s firstround ouster by Harvard, which became the first No. 16
seed to beat a No. 1 seed when it eliminated the Cardinal.
“I guess that’s the counterpoint to all this,” Etheridge
said. “Losing in the first-round was pretty rough
for them.”
The m en’s team and coach Mike Montgomery arrived
home late Sunday night to a boisterous welcome from
some 200 people gathered outside Maples Pavilion, the
school’s basketball home.
The players joined other students in taking the day off
Monday before resuming preparations today for their
meeting with Kentucky. The team is scheduled to leave
for San Antonio on Wednesday.

The players and coaches weren’t the only ones caught
up in the emotional roller coaster.
“When we were down six points with 59 seconds left,
I figured it was over,” said Matt Etheridge, a financial
analyst at Stanford who also plans to attend the Final
Four. “So I walked into a store, was there for a few
minutes, and came back out to the car. The game was still
going on and we were up by one point. It was just very
exciting, a tremendous accomplishment.”
Many students were away on spring break and there
were few tangible signs around campus indicating the
school was in the Final Four. But the athletic department
and its ticket office were inundated.
Stanford received an allotment of 3,500 tickets to the
Final Four and for now, students, alumni, season-ticket
holders and boosters were being given priority to
purchase them.
“The phones have been non-stop since we opened this
morning. Business is very brisk and it’s very exciting,”
assistant athletic director Bob Carruesco said. “It was just
a phenomenal game and the Final Four is something very
special. This is kind of unchartered ground for us, so you
just go through it and enjoy it as you go along.”

Road wins are precious for a team trying to get into the playoffs
PHILA D ELPH IA (AP) —
Road wins are precious for a
team trying to get into the
playoffs, and th a t’s what the
Detroit Pistons got.
Despite struggling in the early
part of the season and firing
coach Doug Collins in February,
the Pistons can see a playoff spot
in the distance.
“It’s good to get a road win,”
said Grant Hill, who finished 17

points and 11 rebounds in the 9479 victory over the Philadelphia
76ers at CoreStates Center. “It is
really important to win these
games so we can m ake the
playoffs.”
Pistons
guard
Jerry
Stackhouse, who came to Detroit
from Philadelphia in December,
also has playoffs on his mind as
the Pistons pulled within 2 1/2
games of eighth-place Orlando

and Washington in the Eastern
Conference.
“We are on a roll and we are
right where we want to be,” said
Stackhouse, who finished with 15
points, including 9-for-9 from the
foul line. “If we can keep it going
and do what w e’re supposed to
do, we will be there in the
playoffs.”
Current Pistons coach Alvin
Gentry likes what he sees of

duo missed 11 games. Coleman,
who missed eight games with
a sprained ankle, had 25 points
and 13 rebounds, while Smith,
who sat out three games with
an abdom inal strain, scored
10 points.
“I was shocked because I had
no idea they would play,” Brown
said of Coleman and Smith. “I’m
glad it means enough for these
guys to try and play.”
Smith was especially hoping
to play on Monday. He was tired
of sitting out.
“I wanted to get back before
five games went by,” said Smith,
who had refused the opportunity
to go onto the injured list.

“I think w e’re playing well

Kentucky fans seek ticket to heaven
LEXINGTON,
Ky.
(AP)
First-year Kentucky coach Tubby
Smith knew the right person to
call about getting his team ready
for the NCAA Final Four - Rick
Pitino.
Smith succeeded Pitino as
coach of the Wildcats last May,
inheriting a program that won the
national title in 1996 and finished
runner-up last season. He reached
Pitino, who is now w ith the
Boston Celtics, by phone in
Chicago on Monday.
Pitino’s advice was to try to
control the environment the team
will be in, keep the players
focused and make sure they
understand their goals and “be
businesslike because they’ll have
plenty of time for fun after it’s
over with,” said Smith, who was
Pitino’s assistant at Kentucky

from 1989-91.
While Smith has never been to
the Final Four as a coach, he took
Tulsa (1994-95) and Georgia
(1996-97)
to
the
NCAA
tournament, with three advancing
to the round of 16. He has a 10-4
record in NCAA play.
“The preparation is where
you’re most concerned because
it’s a unique situation and the
atmosphere around the Final
Four is so different,” said Smith,
who sends his team against
Stanford (30-4) in San Antonio
on Saturday.
Smith believes beating Duke
86-84 in the South Region final
on Sunday, rallying from a 17point deficit in the final nine
minutes, will help his team
heading
into the
national
semifinals.

“We feel like w e’re playing
pretty well, especially a comefrom-behind game that will give
us confidence going into the
Final Four,” he said on Tuesday.
“We were off yesterday. Our guys
look fresh now. Obviously,
they’re excited about going.”
While this is Smith’s first trip
to the Final Four as a coach, it’s
familiar territory for m ost of
his players.
Five of the W ildcats were
members
of
the
national
championship team in 1996, and
seven players on the current
roster played on the team that lost
in the finals to A rizona last
season.
“I was very fortunate we had
talented players returning and the
program was in good shape,”
Smith said.

Harry Caray’s widow to sing his Playoffs
trademark song at home opener from page 14
MESA, Ariz. (AP) — Harry
Caray’s widow
will
lead
spectators in singing “Take Me
Out to the Ball Game” at the
Chicago Cubs’ home opener, the
team announced.
The song was a trademark for
Caray, who sang it during the
seventh-inning stretch at Wrigley
Field. The popular broadcaster —
known as much for the phrase
“Holy cow!” as the song — died
last month in California.
To carry on the tradition, the
Cubs said Monday they plan to
use various “guest conductors”
throughout the 1998 season,

leading off with Dutchie Caray at
the April 3 opener against the
Montreal Expos.
Current Cubs broadcasters,
former players, friends and
family of the late Caray are
among those scheduled to sing,
the team said in a statement
Monday.
Audio tapes of Caray will also
be used on occasion.
Cubs players will wear
commemorative
patches
featuring a caricature of Caray on
the sleeve of their home and road
uniforms during the 1998 season.

remaining in the fourth.
Coleman twice pulled the
76ers within seven, the last time
on a jumper that made it 82-75,
but the Pistons went on a 8-2 run
to extend the advantage to 90-77
with 2:21 left.

Allen Edwards, Cam eron
Mills, Nazr M ohammed, Jeff
Sheppard and Wayne Turner
were around in 1996, but only
Edwards and Sheppard played
against Syracuse in the final.
“It’s special but the last two
years were just as special,”
Edwards said of going back for a
third consecutive season. “It’s
fun. We still have a goal in mind
and that’s winning another title.”
Sheppard was redshirted last
season, while newcomers Jamaal
Magloire and Scott Padgett along
with Turner started in the
championship game.
“They’re going to be a big
help to all the newcomers like
m yself,” Smith said o f the
veteran players.
He said one of the biggest
decisions
he
made
after

becoming coach was naming the
seniors Sheppard, M ills and
Edwards as tri-captains.
“I think by their actions, deeds
and work ethic, which they have
shown all year long,” he said of
their contributions this season. “I
think leading by example is the
best way they help.”
Sheppard said the W ildcats
have embraced Smith’s concept
of unselfish play all season long.
Kentucky (33-4) takes an 11game winning streak into the
national semifinals.
“W e’ve won some close
games and lost some tough
games,” said the senior guard,
who leads the Wildcats with 13.3
points a game. “We know we
have to play as a team. That’s
how we win. We understand
that’s the only way we can win.”

The 76ers had come back
from a 16-point deficit to pull to
within four, 64-60, after three
quarters. Coleman had 11 of his
points in the period. Notes:
@ Coleman took the roster spot
of Kebu Stewart, who was
placed on the injured list due to
tendinitis in the left knee.
Stewart has played in 11 games
this season, averaging 2.8 points

and 2.4 rebounds. ... The 76ers
continued to struggle against the
Central Division, dropping to 617 this season and 9-43 since the
1996-97 season. ... The Pistons
have started 14 different lineups
this season, with no one starting
every game. ... Philadelphia’s
nine first-half field goals were a
CoreStates Center low.
