Back to School Survival Guide

New year presents
Student body president offers ideas
fresh opportunities for for spending spare time on campus
students, newspaper

I f you’re joining us for the
first time, welcome. I f you’re
returning, welcome back.
It’s a brand new year. As
cliché as that may sound, it
couldn’t be truer for the Alestle.
This Back to School Survival
Guide is designed to provide
students the basic tools they need
to succeed at SIU E. It is also our
opportunity to show die new face
o f the Alesde: new topics and a
new design for a new year.
Right now, the Alesde is in
the midst o f a recruitment drive.
We are searching for students
who are eager to lend their talents
to our publication.
We need talented designers
to assist in producing various
sections o f the newspaper. We
need technology-sawy students
eager to assist with our Web site
as we prepare to expand our
online edition to encompass
various forms o f media. O f
course, we need writers - strong
writers. I f you have a way with
words, a knack for interviewing
and a motivation to succeed,
come talk with us.
This newspaper isn’t just for
mass comm m ajors; it’s for
everyone. O f course, the majority
o f our staff comes from the mass
comm department, but we also
have staff members studying
everything from graphic design
to political science to criminal

justice. The Alestle is happy to
employ any qualified, dedicated
student, regardless o f major.
Most importantly, we are
here for you, the reader. Even if
you have no interest whatsoever
in working for the Alestle, we
hope that you still understand
your vital role in our publication.
Do you know o f something
happening on campus? Let us
know!
Do you have an opinion you
want to share with the campus?
Write a Letter to the Editor!
Do you have questions,
comments or concerns about the
paper? By all means, talk with us
about it!
We’re available from 8 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. in Morris University
Center, Room 2022. Feel free to
stop by any time. I mean that
very sincerely - our paper is your
paper and you’re always welcome
here.
If those hours don’t work for
you, I’m available 24 hours a day,
seven
days
a
week
at
alesdeeditor@gmail.com.
Our
Web
site,
www.thealestle.com,
also
provides a medium for readers to
express opinions through polls,
article comments and letters to
the editor. Some exciting changes
are in store for our Web site in
the future, so keep your eyes
peeled!
The
sem ester
is
just
beginning, but we’re already very
excited about what the Alestle has
to offer this year.
So, again, welcome. We
hope this Back to School Survival
Guide will provide you with the
information you need to get this
semester o ff to a good start.
Remember, this is a brand new
year - for you, for me, for the
Alestle. Let’s make it count.

Back to School Survival Guide

Chancellor invites students to become involved at SIUE
Welcome to a new year o f
excitement and opportunity at
SIUE! You are here to build on
your education and experiences
o f the past and to pursue learning
a vast wealth o f knowledge
available
through
higher
education. Years from now, you
will likely find that fall brings to
mind memories o f textbook
shopping, new friendships and
rewarding classes. Whether you
are a new or returning student,
commit to making the most o f
your time on campus.
As students, you will benefit
from our excellent academic
programs, our faculty and staff
committed to providing you with
high
quality
educational
opportunities
and
our

harmonious campus climate that
encourages open dialogue and
mutual
respect
among
individuals
with
different
backgrounds,
cultures
and
perspectives.
Citizenship,
excellence, integrity, openness
and wisdom comprise our
university values and guide our
work day in and day out. These
values are so important to SIUE
that you will be reminded o f
them every time you see the large
banner in the Morris University
Center.
As in other worthwhile
endeavors, the outcome is often
proportional to the investment.
This is true both in your
academic and extracurricular
activities. There are numerous

opportunities to get involved in
the life o f the university.
For example, there are
frequent faculty and student
exhibits in the Art and Design
Building and in the MUC. There
is also the Arts & Issues series
and
a
wide
variety
of
organizations, associations and
clubs to broaden your university
experience. The Student Fitness
Center is home to a variety o f
exciting recreational programs
and, while every day is a great
day to be a Cougar, this is
especially true on days with
scheduled athletic events students are admitted free!
Another
important
opportunity for activity and
involvement during your college

experience is to stay informed
and offer your opinions on
campus issues. An excellent way
to do this is by reading the
campus newspaper, the Alesde.
The name is a combination o f
Alton, East St. Louis and
Edwardsville and highlights the
unity o f SIUE’s three educational
branches. The Alestle is one
vehicle through which the entire
campus communicates. Don’t
hesitate to weigh in on topics o f
interest.
The fall semester signals a
renewed
opportunity
for
investment in the future. I am
pleased and excited to welcome
you to SIUE, a university that is
on the move and quickly gaining
national recognition. Best wishes

>

for a successful and fulfilling
academic year.
Go Cougars!
Vaughn Vandegrift
Chancellor

Vice chancellor challenges students to achieve success at SIUE

Dear Students:
Welcome to the SIU E
community! This is an exciting
time in your life. As a student,
you will be introduced to many
new and different ideas and
experiences;
you
will
be

challenged to think logically and
creatively
about
difficult
questions and you will be asked
to discuss the answers to these
questions. Join in the discussions,
you have much to offer.
From my perspective, here
are some valuable points to
assure your success as an SIUE
student:
First and foremost, invest the
time and energy necessary to
achieve good grades.
Most
academicians
recommend a minimum o f two
hours studying outside o f class
for every hour o f class. Attend
class regularly and make sure you
know
your
instructor’s
attendance policy. Be on time and
be prepared for every class
meeting. Sit in the front o f the

classroom! Follow your syllabus
and make sure that you are
organized
and
that
your
assignments are completed in a
timely manner. I f you need help,
talk with your instructor or
adviser so he or she can direct
you to die best source o f help.
Second, resolve conflicts,
differences and disputes by
thoughtful discussion.
Civility is a cornerstone o f
our academic community; you
are expected to act and behave
accordingly. At times you may
disagree with fellow members o f
the academic community. Part o f
your college experience is
learning to resolve disagreements
in a fashion that is in keeping
with your role as an educated
member o f the SIUE academic

community.
Third, get involved in
student life.
There
are
numerous
opportunities available to you to
become involved in activities and
services beyond the classroom.
Check
out
the
student
organizations on campus; they
need
your
participation.
Consider doing volunteer work
related to your academic major or
participate in the social and
recreational opportunities on
campus. All o f these activities
give you the chance to interact
with your fellow students, faculty
and staff and serve to enrich and
broaden your education.
Fourth, and lastly, take care
o f yourself.
Achieve the balance between

what is required to succeed at the
university
and
the
other
obligations o f family and work.
Occasional stress is a normal part
o f a student’s life. H ow you cope
with it, in a constructive manner,
will make all the difference for
you. Make lifestyle decisions that
are in your best interest.
Again, I welcome you to
SIUE. I look forward to meeting
you on campus and hope you
find your university experience
both rewarding and memorable.
Sincerely,
Narbedi R. Emmanuel,
Ph.D.
Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs

Relaxing in the Morris University Center
From Cougar Lanes to Center Court,
the MUC provides a one-stop shop for students
by Aaron Sudholt
Alestle News Editor

Looking for food or any
other service at SIU E can lead
you to one o f the several different
locations on campus where
students, faculty and staff can
find a bite to eat, have a good
time or even get a haircut.
The
Morris
University
Center has several different
businesses
and
universityoperated stores located within its
walls. Students who need
something either related to their
university life or anything else
can usually find it there.
“This is a home away from
home,” M U C D irector Mary
Robinson said. “ We try to
provide for (students’) out-of­
classroom needs.”
Food is the most prominent
feature o f the M U C, with five
non-SIUE businesses on the first
and lower floor o f the building.
Pizza
Hut,
Chick-Fil-A,
Starbucks, Auntie Anne’s and
Taco Bell all offer fast food and
snack options.
The MUC is open Monday
through Saturday from 6:30 a.m.
until midnight. On Sunday, it is
open from 1 0:30 a.m. until
midnight.
Other food areas not
affiliated
with
third-party
businesses have traditional food
offerings. A deli, noodle and
pasta counter, a grill and a general
food area designed to offer
home-style foods each have
places in die lower level o f the
building.
Students do not have to go
to the MUC to get food all the
time, however. The Woodland
Hall Cart and the Bluff Hall Cafe
are both available for those
wanting food before classes in the
morning or after classes at night.
The Skyvvalk Cafe is on the
walkway between Founders and
Alumni Halls' third level and
connects the two buildings. It
offers drinks and prepared food
during operating hours.
Serving Cougar Village
residents is the Commons
Building,
which
provides
common services as well as food
for Cougar Village residents.
Mailboxes for all Cougar
Village residents are in the lower
level o f the Commons Building,
along with mailboxes and a
stamp machine on the upper
level. Residents can mail letters
here and can receive packages at
the front desk on the upper level.
Also provided are laundry
facilities and a computer lab.
The Commons Grill offers a
small grocery store for residents

at the Cougar Lanes, along with bowling and a video arcade.

as well as a grill area where
residents can buy sub sandwiches,
hamburgers or fried chicken,
among other selections.
However, those on meal
plans can only receive their 60-40
discount on items prepared at the
grill and not those in the grocer)'.
For example, a freshly grilled
hamburger will receive the
discount, but a box o f cereal or a
bottle o f soda will not.
The 60-40 discount is only
given to residents on campus
who buy a meal plan. Those
residents are given a balance
usually worth about 40 percent
o f their original payment, and
then they receive a
discount so that
the items they buy
from either the
MUC food areas
or
from
the
Cougar Village
Commons Grill
have
costs
reduced to about
40 percent o f
their original price. For example,
a $6 item will be reduced in cost
to about S2.40.
Items in the University
Center and non-food MUC
stores are not covered by the
discount. A S I. 10 bottle o f soda
will remain $1.10, even though
the meal plan account already has
a balance that has been reduced

60 percent. The bottle o f soda is
160 percent more expensive than
if you bought one covered by the
60-40 plans sold in another store.
Bottles o f soda bought in the
MUC food court are covered by
the 60-40 plan, for example.
The M UC also offers a
recreational facility - Cougar
Lanes.
Cougar Lanes offers 16
bowling lanes with an electronic
scoring system. Cougar Lanes
also has an arcade, as well as
billiards and table tennis.
The bowling rate for
students is S1.25 per person.
Faculty, staff and alumni rates are
$ 1 .50
from
M onday
to
Friday and $2
on weekends.
Public rates are
$1.75
during
weekdays and
$2.25
on
weekends. All
bowling shoe
rentals
cost
$1.25 per game. For both
billiards and table tennis it costs
$3 per hour and for the public
$3.60 per hour.
In addition, the MUC has a
bookstore located just inside the
entrance and is closest to the
Stratton Quadrangle.
“We’ve got the bookstore
where (students, faculty and

staff) can get books and their
reading,” Robinson said.
The University Bookstore
offers selections for out-of-class
required reading plus recreational
reading books, magazines and
class supplies, such as pens,

notebooks, blank Cds, as well as
SIUE merchandise.
Bookstore hours are 8 a.m.
to 6:30 p.m. Monday through
Thursday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Renter’s insurance shields campus residents

Need some extra protection?
Renter’s insurance may be just
the thing to ease your worries.
Living on campus is full o f
new experiences: meeting new
people, buying new stuff - almost
a whole new way o f life. But with
this new way o f life also comes
new risks.
University Housing Director
Michael
Schultz
strongly
encourages students who live on
campus to consider renter’s

insurance.
“ Students are not required but they are strongly encouraged
- to have renter’s insurance or
check to see if they are covered by
their parents’ hom eowner’s
policy,” Schultz said.
For those who are not
covered under their parents’
policy, or who opt to have their
own plan, there are many

options. Schultz recommends
one company in particular
because o f their longstanding
tradition o f helping students.
“We
recommend
one
company on our Web site, but
(students)
can
also
get
(insurance) at any insurance
company like State Farm,
Allstate, etc.,” Schultz said.
The recommended company,
National Student Services Inc.,

has been providing affordable
insurance to college students for
nearly two decades. Their
“ Student Personal Property Plan”
is recognized at over 1,000
colleges and universities across
the United States.
With this plan, students
living both on and o ff campus are
covered for a full year. With a
minimum deductible o f $25, the
cost is less than $40 a month.

With a higher deductible, the cost
goes down to around $30 a
month for $2,000 in coverage.
The plan protects students’
belongings from fire, vandalism
and even theft. Examples o f
things that are protected are
clothing, electronic equipment,
jewelry, computers and bicycles.
However, there are special
provisions that apply. For
example, personal property is

covered inside a vehicle as long as
the automobile was locked and
there is evidence o f a forced entry.

Rendleman Hall has many campus services
by Katherine Jung
Alestle News Stringer

Rendleman Hall is the
university’s
central
administration building and is
home to many offices students
will need to visit on • a regular
basis.
Perhaps the office that gets
the most traffic is the Student
Service Center. Located in room
1309, some o f their services
include class registration and
changes, and transcript requests.
It is also where students receive
their Cougar ID cards that are
needed for a variety o f services on
campus.
Regular hours for the Service
Center during fall semester are
8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through
Thursday and 8 a.m. to 4:30
p.m. Friday.
Another important office to
know in case the unfortunate
should occur is Health Sendees,
which is located on the lower
level o f Rendleman at 0224.
All students, faculty and
employees are eligible for
appointments
with
Health
Services with their valid Cougar
ID card.
Health
Services
offers
prescriptions at lower costs,
confidential H IV and STD
testing and a free counseling
service.
The Student Employment
office, which is located in Room
2221, is also a service that many
students take advantage of.

Students can find jobs both onand off-campus. Jobs listed
w ithin instudent employment can
usually be scheduled around
classes.
Students can also view jobs
available
online
at
stuemp.siue.edu.
One office that most
students visit is Parking Services.
Parking Services is open 8 a.m. to
4 :3 0 p.m. Monday through
Friday and is in Room 1113.
All students who park in
SIUE parking lots are required to
have the appropriate permit.
Students who wish to purchase a
permit must have their driver’s
license, the license plate number
o f the vehicle and a completed
SIUH parking permit registration
form.
Permits range from $72 to
$112 and acceptable forms o f
payment include cash, check,
MasterCard and Visa.
The SIU E Post Office is
located on the lower level o f
Rendleman Hall in Room 0232.
The post office is a fully
functional post office running
Monday through Friday. Students
and staff can ship packages, buy
stamps and rent post-office
boxes. Letters can also be mailed.
Post office boxes are only
available for students and
employees o f SIUE and can be
rented for a fee o f $15 per

Keeping a GPA strong is only a matter of
time and effort for some college students
by Matthew Schroyer
Alestle News Stringer

With college starting up again, it is
important for students to remember how
to survive in the classroom.
For returning students, it means
getting back in the groove. For incoming
freshmen, it means developing study
habits.
You probably suspected it, but the
first rule o f GPA

that there is a lot in that little document.
“The syllabus will have a professor’s
synopsis o f the course,” she said. “It may
give you a calendar to make sure you are
up to date, a breakdown o f grades and
what material is covered.”
When in doubt, always go back to
the syllabus.

Disruptions during tests and other classroom work have led administraters to discuss rules for
classroom conduct.

Cougar Code dictates conduct
by Aaron Sudholt
Alestle News Editor

Classroom disruptions can
be a big problem for students and
instructors alike. For new and old
students at SIUE, a new set o f
codes have been offered in order
to prevent chaos in the
classroom.
Earlier in the summer, the
Cougar Code and the Cougar
Creed were presented to Student

Government at the June 2
meeting.
While these codes are not
mandatory,
Associate
Vice
Chancellor Jim Klenke said they
will be considered more closely as
die year goes on and faculty and
students have the opportunity to
better examine them.
The code is aimed at
preventing disruptions not only
in class, but within the school
itself.

The Cougar Creed
As a member of the SIUE learning community, I am:
9 Committed to the SIUE community, its past, present and future.
• Open to other points of view.
• United in school pride and spirit.
• Grateful for the privilege and the opportunities of higher
education.
• Accepting of classmates as colleagues and equals.
• Respectful of the rights and property of others.

The Cougar Commitment
As a member of the SIUE learning community, I pledge to uphold
honorable and high standards. I commit to participate in a friendly
and unique academic community. I will practice personal and
academic integrity, respect the dignity of all people and respect the
rights and property of others. I will demonstrate a concern for others,
their feelings and their need for conditions which support their work
and development. I have a responsibility to achieve academic and
personal success and to make a positive difference on campus and
in the community. Commitment to these ideals requires that I refrain
from and discourage behaviors which threaten the freedom and
respect that every individual deserves.

“It’s all about respect,”
Klenke said. “Treat a faculty
member with all the respect they
deserve.”
Students are encouraged to
maintain a courteous attitude in
class. In January, Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs Narbeth
Emmanuel issued a statement for
students to follow certain
guidelines in the classroom.
Continually
disruptive
students have been subject to
some discipline depending on the
incident.
“I f they’ve been majorly
disruptive, they will be subject to
actions from the conduct code,”
Klenke said. “We’ve had students
that have been very disruptive,
students who have not given the
floor when the instructor asked
for it.”
Klenke said he would be
discussing classroom etiquette
with the deans and other
concerned groups on campus as
well as talk to freshmen in their
112 classes this fall.
“ Let’s work together to
make this a better year,” Klenke
said. “This is an institute o f
higher learning, let’s expect the
best o f us and we’ll have a better
experience.”

Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m.
Not only can students fill
their stomachs and brush up on
literature in the MUC, but they
can also find haircare.
University Hair on the lower
level offers haircuts to anyone
interested. It has been a part o f
the MUC since the late 60s and is
not affiliated with any national
chain.
“We do hair, nails, anything
to do with hair,” University Hair
Manager Terry Knebel said.
Though walk-ins are serviced
according to availability, haircuts
and other salon tasks are done by
appointment.
“ If we can do walk-ins, we
will,” Knebel said.
Rates for a haircut and
shampoo are usually $20, Knebel
said. A manicure is $15.
Pedicures are also available.
Students who need help
designing projects or any print

job that a professional printing
service can provide can find help
for it within the MUC.
The Print and Design office
gives students a professional
printing service involving the
printing o f pictures, documents
and other items for students.
Photocopying,
color
printing and even large printing
such as for banners and posters is
available through Print and
Design. Students can also use
workstations to create and print
their own flyers and other items.
For a fee, student workers can
make the design.
Music and dancing are part
o f the MUC as well.
The Meridian Ballroom
often hosts dances, lectures and
concerts that are either sponsored
by SIUE or those who have paid
to use it.

nobody else does,” Schmoll said.
“In case something gets stolen, it
is easier for us to identify things.”
A form is also available that
can be helpful in case a valuable
item is stolen.
“There is a form they get so
they can write down the model
number and serial number (of
valuables),” Schmoll said.
He suggested that students
keep this form with their
“important files.”
Schmoll also suggested that
students “program the (police
station phone number), 6503324, into their phone so that
they have it on file in their phone
listing and they don’t have to
remember it when it is needed.”
This is important because the
sooner the police respond to an
incident the better chance that it
will be positively resolved.
“I f they wait, the longer they
wait, the chances decrease o f us
solving the crime,” Schmoll said.
“I f you discover a theft, see a
fight in progress or see
something that just doesn’t seem
right, call right away,” Schmoll
said. “It might be nothing. It
might be something.”

shown

expertise,”
Instructional Support Specialist
Andrew Lamonica said.
Pictures o f the tutors who
work in the lab are posted on the
wall so if students there have
trouble with programming, they
can easily find tutors on staff.
I f there are no tutors
working, students who need help
can ask one another in the 30person lab.
The lab is aimed at helping
students in the 100 and 200 level
computer science courses.
Other departments have

their own tutoring classes,
though not all have been made
known to Instructional Services
yet and are not currently listed on
their Web site.
“If they don’t tell us about it,
we don’t list it,” Patty-Graham
said. “I think it is important for
students to talk to their
instructors about what tutoring is
available.”
For more information on
Instructional Services, including
a list o f courses with tutoring

drawal” is given for the course.
When calculating your GPA, a
course with a grade o f “W ” is
basically left out.
During weeks 11 to 13,
students can drop courses only
with the signature o f their
professor and adviser on an
add/drop form. You will be given
either a “WP” for “withdrew
passing” or “WF” for “withdrew
failing,” based on your progress
in the course. A “W P” is
calculated the same way as a “W ”
for your GPA. A “WF,” on the
other hand, is calculated the same
as the standard “F.”
The catalog also explains that
after week 13, you cannot drop
courses. The professor will assign
you something else besides a “W,”
“ WP” or a “WF.” Talk with your
professor about what grade you
might receive.
Regardless of the stage you
are in, seek academic advice
before dropping.
“ Definitely
talk
to
a
professor,” Bell said. “Also, talk to
an adviser.”

Dropping a course could
mean you have to change your
future courses.
After making an educated
decision, the next step is to head
over to the Service Center and fill
out an add/drop form. Make sure
you have your Cougar Card with
you since they will ask for it.
After the changes are made, take a
walk over to textbook rental to
drop off your old books.
The old adage “ work hard,
play hard” also applies to college,
so go out there and enjoy college
life. Blow o ff some steam after
studying and reward yourself
with good times with friends. O f
course, it would be irresponsible
not to tell you to keep it safe. So,
keep your studying smart and
your fun safe.

adding or dropping classes or for
more information about the

The brown permit was

according to a Sept. 15 Alestle
article. Prior to that, red permits

Vanzo expects that students
will not have a hard time getting
a brown permit this year if they

“We had quite a few unsold

I f a student is ticketed for
parking at an expired meter, the
cost is $15. The cost for parking

Nursing students also participate
in the nurse summer training
program.
Army ROTC improves the
marketability o f college graduates.
Businesses desire people with the
leadership and management skills
taught through military science
courses. Employers and graduate
schools prize the experience of
Army officers available to
students who complete Army
ROTC with a commission.
After
satisfying
their
obligations, Army officers may

Phi Kappa Phi
The primary objective o f the
national honor society o f Phi
Kappa Phi is the recognition and
encouragement o f superior
scholarship in all academic
disciplines. The society is
convinced that in recognizing
and honoring those persons of
good character who have excelled
in scholarship, in whatever field,
it will stimulate others to strive
for excellence.
In 1897, a group o f 10
students at the University o f
Maine, who perceived a need for
an honor society on broader lines
than any then in existence, was

was transformed into a national
society by action o f a committee
composed o f the presidents o f the
University o f Maine, the
University o f Tennessee and
Pennsylvania State College, now
Pennsylvania State University.
The Society was renamed Phi
Kappa Phi, from the initial letters
o f the Greek words forming its
adopted motto: Philosophia

roughly
translated as, “Let the love o f
learning rule humanity.”
PKP currently has chapters
in institutions from Maine to the

Psychology
Psychology is the study of
behavior and mental processes.
Psychology students learn
about the intricacies o f human
behavior from infancy to old age.
For example, decades o f research
on conformity reveals that
intelligent,
well-mannered
college students will routinely say
things they know to be false just
to fit in with group norms. While
studying what people do and
think (along with how or why
they do it and think it),
psychology students learn to look
beyond simplistic explanations.
Psychology students examine the

complexity o f life from a variety
o f perspectives and theories.
Psychology is among the
most popular majors in the
country.
Psychology is a highly
ranked university major - and for
good reason. Employers want
people with good social skills,
honed critical thinking skills and
insight. The study o f psychology
can help students develop these
skills and much more. The
department’s mission is to
provide excellent and rigorous
training in the science and
practice o f psychology at both
the undergraduate and graduate
levels. The goal is to develop
educated individuals who are
competitive in both top-quality
graduate programs and the job
market.
Psychology is excellent
preparation for a career or
graduate school.
Although Dr. Phil may be
the
most
well-known
psychologist o f this generation,
his career path isn’t typical o f
psychology students. There are
many job opportunities for
people with a degree in
psychology. Since psychology
students are immersed in research
and the scientific method, the
skills they develop are highly
valued by employers. A solid
general education from SIUE
along with a psychology major
will prepare a student for a range
o f career opportunities in areas
such as community services,
customer services, employee
relations, human resources, law
enforcement, market research,
sales and social services - just to
name a few examples. Graduate
training is required for licensure
in psychology.
Psychology is a science - not
a television show.
The main character in the
USA Network television show
“Monk” is portrayed as a quirky
detective with an obsessivecompulsive disorder who attends
therapy frequendy and uses his
powers o f observation and keen
intellect to solve crimes. Other
television shows and movies
present psychological issues in
various
ways,
but
these
representations are almost always
devoid o f the insightful scientific
findings that characterize the
progress in the field o f
psychology. One o f the benefits
o f taking a psychology class,
completing a psychology minor
or graduating with a psychology
degree is learning to approach
human behavior and mental
processes
as
a
scientist.
Psychology is a science! Take a
psychology class and explore the
science o f psychology!

Department o f Psychology

Psychology Club
The Psychology Club is an
academic society organized to
offer social and academic
opportunities in the field o f
psychology
The club’s main goal is to
provide a broader education to

students concerning issues in
psychology and the psychology

Many students
enter the
psychology field not fully
understanding the extensive
aspects o f the subject or the
educational requirements in
psychology.
The Psychology Club is in its

Social Work
In the past, people often
thought social workers were
people who gave out money to
the poor, public aid workers, or
those people who took children
away from their families, child
welfare workers.
While
social
workers
continue to work in the child
welfare field, the emphasis is now
on the reunification o f families

and service delivery referrals for
day care,
counseling and
substance abuse treatment.
Furthermore, social workers
rarely work for the Department
o f Human Services, which
administers
programs
of
assistance to the aged, blind,
disabled, temporary assistance to
needy families, the food stamp
program and child support
payment programs.
So where are social workers

Theater and Dance
The Department o f Theater
and Dance plays an important

role in the cultural programming
on the SIU E campus. Campus
life is enriched by the six main
stage shows produced by the
department.
The stage is the laboratory
and workshop for students
studying dance, design and
performance, but it takes an
audience to create a theatrical
experience. SIU E students take
advantage o f the tickets they can
get free with their student ID.
Students make up the bulk o f the
audience for the productions in
Dunham H all Theater and
Metcalf Theater.
Attending theater events can
be an extension o f college
students’ learning experiences. It
allows people to see issues from
another point o f view, to
question, to think and to be
entertained.
SIU E is a liberal arts
university and students have the
opportunity to experience all of
the arts during their education.

Landlord laws
A guide to your rights as a tenant
by Andy Rathnow

Students living in an offcampus apartment may find
themselves in a conflict with their
landlord through the course of
their lease.
Learning tenant/landlord
rules and regulations may prove
to be a valuable resource to

“The best course
o f action is to
meet with the

figure out whether
the problem can
be worked out.”
student renters. The Illinois
Compiled Statutes are available
in the reference section of
Lovejoy Library.
The lease agreement is the
most important
piece
of
reference for a renter. Always
make sure every occupant and
the landlord has a copy o f the
lease with each party’s signature.
This can prevent acts o f forgery
and falsification by the landlord.
If a renter does not have a
written lease, it would be best to
talk to the landlord about getting
the terms o f the agreement in
writing or on audiocassette. This

helps to clarify what duties and
responsibilities are the landlord’s
and which are the tenant’s.
Most leases outline when the
rent is due and when the rent
must be paid, which helps avoid
late fees or increases in the
amount due. There is an
important distinction between
these two dates because most
landlords do not expect payment
until the day the rent must be
paid. However, the landlord can
file a five-day notice, or five-day
demand for rent, after the rent’s
due date. After those five days, if
rent is not paid, the landlord can
file for an eviction. A landlord
would not be likely to win an
eviction suit if he or she has not
sent a five-day notice and
allowed those five days to pass.
The demand for rent is outlined
in 735 ILCS 5/9-209.
Any violation o f a term or
condition o f the lease allows the
lease to be canceled by the
landlord via a 10-day notice to
quit (735 ILC S 5/9-210).
However, due to often vague and
conflicting lease terms and
conditions, why the landlord is
accusing the tenant o f the
violations and whether the tenant
believes him or herself to be in
violation should be researched.
The best course o f action is
to meet with the landlord and
figure out whether the problem
can be worked out. I f it cannot,

Communication key to roommates’ relationships
by Courtney Rakers
Alestle Managing Editor

It’s 3 a.m. You’re busy trying
to cram for your 9 a.m. math
midterm when your roommate
strolls in. She’s drunk - again.
You try to ignore her and
continue studying, but she wants
to talk about the hot guy who
was hitting on her at the party
while she blasts Ashlee Simpson
on her computer. Studying is just
not going to happen. It wouldn’t
be such a big deal if this were an
occasional behavior, but this girl
drinks like a fish every night of
the week. What do you do?
Roommates are not always
easy to handle. From the

obnoxious boyfriend who has
taken up residence in your room
to the mold growing on the
bathroom sink, there are a lot o f
conflicts that can arise from
living with another person, some
o f them big and some small.
Sophomore genetics major
Ashley Hay said she had no
trouble with her roommate, but
her suitemates had trouble
remembering to clean the
bathroom.
“I had to talk to them,” Hay
said. “It wasn’t bad though, they
understood (my concerns) and
the problem was resolved.”
Transfer student Lauren
Showalter had a similar issue
with her roommate, but resolved

it another way.
“I had a roommate who
would not clean the bathroom,”

ccIf you have a
big pet peeve, let
them know in
advance so
there won’t be
trouble later.”
-Ashley Hay,
sophomore
Showalter said. “ We talked to her
and she ended up paying us $10

to clean the bathroom for her.
“It worked for us,” she
added. “I was fine with taking
the money.”
No matter what the problem
is, working with your roommate
to find a compromise that works
is key.
Hay felt she had a good
relationship with her roommate
in part because they knew each
other from high school and in
part because o f their similar
personalities.

Laundry tips
for the novice washer
by Courtney Rakers

Alestle Managing Editor

many loads
for obvious

financial
College life is full o f firsts.
Some smdents may be faced with
the prospect o f doing their own
laundry for the first time - ever.
Piles o f dirty laundry cluttering
the floor can be unattractive, as
well as more than a little
distracting.
Although
doing
laundry
can
seem
o v e rw h e lm in g ,
following a few
simple steps will
have you on the
road to a clean
wardrobe in no
time.
The first step
to successfully running a load o f
laundry is sorting. Separate the
lights from the darks and make a
separate pile for heavier items like
jeans, sweaters and towels.
Delicates should be washed in
their own load to avoid damage.
Bright colors, particularly reds,
should also be washed separately
from the rest o f your clothing, as
they tend to run in warmer
temperatures.
This is the proper way to
sort clothes. It may be unrealistic
for some students to run this

reasons or if
they are doing their laundry
weekly because they may not
have enough to fill a load.
There are two solutions to
this: find a “laundry partner” and
wash your clothes together or
combine different types o f loads
and
wash
everything in
cold
water.
Cold water is
not as effective
for cleaning as
hot, but this

“ Cold water is
not as effective for
cleaning as hot,
but this ensures
nothing will run.”

ensures

nothing
will
run.
Once the
laundry is sorted, double-check
the instructions on the labels.
The instructions will often give
ideal
washer
and
dryer
temperatures and cycles for the
item. Remember: dry clean only
means dry clean only.
Now you can begin the
actual washing process. First,
select the correct cycle. As a
general rule o f thumb, whites and
colors run on the regular cycle.
Whites are washed in hot water,
colors in warm or cold water.
Delicates and wool clothing

should be washed in the delicate
cycle with cold water. Jeans and
towels can be washed in the
permanent press cycle with cold
water.
Start the cycle. Add the
correct amount o f powder or
liquid detergent according to the
instructions on the box. It is
important to fill the washer with
enough water to dissolve the
detergent before adding the
laundry. As a rule o f thumb,
powder detergent takes longer to
dissolve than liquid, so let more
water in for powder.
Do not overfill the washer.
Your
clothes
should
be
completely covered with water
and go no higher than the top o f
the agitator. I f a washer is
overloaded, it may be thrown off
balance and stop and will not
clean your clothing as well. When
the washer is properly loaded and
set to the correct cycle, start the
machine and take a break.
Once the cycle is complete,
you can begin drying your
clothes. Check the lint filter and
clean off excess lint if necessary. If
you choose to use dryer sheets,

add them now.
Put your clothes into the
dryer. Again, overfilling the dryer
will not save time or money. One
load in the washing machine is
one load in the dryer.
The normal setting is hot
which is good for drying large
loads. Permanent press is a more
moderate heat setting and

We’ve Cjot Your Sty
Tor ‘B ack to ScitooCl

delicate is a low heat setting.
Recheck your clothing’s care tags
if in doubt. Begin the dryer and
take another break.
Once your clothes are dry,
remove the laundry and hang or
fold each item to avoid wrinkles.
You’re finished!

with new students at freshman orientation.
SIUE Police Lt. Kevin Schmoll said campus police
have received just a few reports o f Internet harassment,
mostly involving e-mail. More extreme cases o f
harassment could lead to a misdemeanor charge.
“If it occurred on campus, it would be considered in
our venue (and) then you could press charges,” Schmoll
said. “It’s actually a disorderly conduct charge. If it occurs
somewhere out o f state, we’d have to turn it over to
whatever agency it occurred in, wherever the message was
sent from.”

One o f the most popular directories in the academic
world is Facebook. The site supports more than 22,000
high schools and 2,200 colleges and universities,
including SIUE.
Opened in February 2004, the site has had more than
8 million users. According to a Facebook press release,
“two-thirds o f people come back to the site ever}' day and
spend an average o f 20 minutes” making it the “seventhmost trafficked site in the United States.”
In addition, beginning in May, work networks,
supporting 6,400 companies, were added to Facebook to
accommodate the growing number o f alumni. According
to a Facebook press release, “one-third o f college students
on Facebook” graduated at the end o f the 2005-06
academic year and joined the workforce. “Forty-five
percent o f Facebook’s college alumni currently come back

their existing accounts and then invite coworkers to

Despite the growing number o f users, whether they
are still attending high school or now working for
A.G. Edwards, Facebook claims privacy is still a top
priority and that users are safe. The Web site
attributes part o f the site’s success to the privacy-control
tools.

The “My Privacy” option in the toolbar on the left
side o f the site offers many choices for protection. The site
allows members to decide which networks may see their
profiles and photo albums; whether faculty, staff, alumni,
graduate students or undergraduate students may see
details; what specific contact information, such as home
address and cell phone number, is available and who it is
available to; and who may view members’ login status or

Privacy in local networks
The SIU E Directory
While students should definitely take precautions when signing up for large social networking sites
such as Facebook or MySpace, campus members looking for privacy closer to home may want to keep
details private in the 2006-07 SIUE Directory. Such students should act quickly as the deadline for
directory exclusion is fast approaching.
The directory, which provides personal information, such as the campus member’s name, home
address, phone number, SIUE Web mail account address, major and class, is made available on the SIUE
Web site and in print form and is usually available early in the fall semester.
“The deadline for fall is Aug. 25 and although we take the forms at any time, you have to get it in by
then to be excluded from the published university directories (this year),” Office o f the Registrar Assistant
Manager Chris Leopold said. “ (In the) last academic year, fall 2005 through this past summer, we had 60
students who had new requests.”
Once students ask for their information to be excluded, the hold stands in the following years.
To have information excluded from the directory, students may fill out the form available in
the Service Center in Rendleman Hall Room 1309 or visit the registrar’s Web site at
siue.edu/registrar/forms, print the Directory Information Release PDF and return the filled out form to
the Service Center. Students also looking to cancel the privacy hold may also fill out the form available in
the Service Center or on the Web site.

With Facebook being one o f the most popular
social networking sites in the academic world, it is
only smart to keep up to date on how to keep
private details from getting to the public.

their personal network.
Like Facebook, MySpace
gives users the opportunities to
join groups, upload pictures,
send private messages and
comment on members’ profiles.
Nearing 100 million users,
MySpace recently has been under
heat for less than satisfactory
security measures. The mother of
a 14-year-old Texas girl filed a
lawsuit against M ySpace this
summer. According to a June 30
article in Fortune Magazine, “the
girl says that a 19-year-old posing
on the site as a high school
football player lured her in May
to an apartment-complex parking
lot, where he sexually assaulted
her.”
One
major
difference
between MySpace and Facebook
is the anonymity MySpace
brings. Since the site does not
require a valid e-mail address
through
a
supported
organization, anyone can join
and, essentially, be whoever he or
she wants to be.
“People aren’t always who
they say they are,” according to
the Myspace Web site. “Be careful
about adding strangers to your
‘friends’ list. It’s fun to connect
with new MySpace friends from
all over the world, but avoid
meeting people in person whom
you do not fully know. I f you
must meet someone, do it in a
public place and bring a friend or
trusted adult.”
In addition, MySpace offers
options to block and report users
who are harassing site members.
The site also suggests contacting
MySpace
if
someone
is
pretending to be you.
Users must be at least 14
years o f age to use MySpace and
the profiles o f minors remain
private to those over the age of
18. While it is stricdy prohibited
to lie about age on MySpace,

some users have lied in the past
to obtain a private profile.
However, recently, MySpace
opened the private profile
option to users over the age o f
18.

protect yourself, who will?”
Many students, however, feel
safe with a public profile on
online social networks. Despite
having a public profile, senior
theater and dance major Mary
O’Rourke says only allowing
people you know as friends on
sites such as Facebook can
help
protect
personal
information.
“I feel fine with a public
profile on Facebook. I have never
had any problems or situations
where I felt in danger or
threatened
by
anyone,”
O’ Rourke said. “There are
options to only let your friends
see your profile and you don’t
have to add people you don’t
know or talk to them. Just be
smart about how you handle
your profile and die re should be
no problems.”
Some, who feel comfortable
with public profiles on Facebook,
do not necessarily have the same
feelings for MySpace.
“I do feel safe with a
public profile on Facebook
because it gives you an
opportunity to include what you
want and don’t want other
people to see. It also allows you
to set your profile to where
others can’t see it unless you
accept them as a friend,” senior
graphic design major Amber
Burtle said.

With the addition o f global groups on Facebook,
users from any school or work network may connect
with mumal interests. While “The Largest Facebook
Group Ever” may guarantee you a harmless and chat
room-like wall discussion with the cute stranger from
Harvard, private messages can make the chat a little less
anonymous. Once a member sends a message to an outof-network user, selected profile details, such as the 300
pictures you are linked to, become available to those
who receive the messages.

Since Facebook has provided unlimited photo space
for members, the possibilities for embarrassment are
endless. Even more so, since many alumni and
employers are becoming wiser about social networks, a
picture o f you drinking a beer at last weekend’s bar

One o f the m ost interesting profile details on
Facebook is the relationship status. Whether a fledgling
new couple finally admits their “ In a Relationship”
status or a drama-loving pair says “It’s Com plicated”
every other week, relationship status invites much
interest to everyone from the user’s friends to strangers
in the network. When a member changes his or her
status to “Single” or “ Whatever I Can G et,” the m ost
suave o f Facebookers may take that as an invitation for
some romance. If you want to avoid messages boasting
o f good times, leave your status blank or marry your
best friend to avoid the notes.

solidified his decision.
“It was then that I watched

to break up not a few days after
they had become intimate with
one another,” Clothier said. “A

Services help students keep their balance
Center in on wellness
by Kristen Reber
Alestle Asst. Managing Editor

Nestled near the main
entrance o f the Student
Fitness Center, just across
from the center’s basketball
courts, is the Wellness Center.
While the office may be
missed on first glance, the
center offers a number of
services that should not be

overlo
oked.
Chris Koenig,

Assistant
Director, Fitness Programs,
who joined the Wellness
Center in June, says there is
more to health than a good
workout and the center is
there to help with a variety of
programs available for littleto-no-cost.
“ The idea behind the
Wellness Center is in the title.
It is not just fitness. It is
about wellness,” Koenig said.
“I want students to be able to
use the Wellness Center as a
resource. Almost everything
we offer is free for students
and (that) is the big thing
we’d liBTto get across. Some
students may use the Student
Fitness Center and don’t
realize we are right here and
have services that can be very
beneficial for them.”
One o f the latest services
to be added to the Wellness
Center is the Bod Pod, a nonKaty Hartwig/Alestle invasive measuring device.

“The Bod Pod measures
body composition and is
probably the most accurate
tool that is being used in
exercise physiology right
now,” Koenig said.

Bod Pod is a complete

technology.
Because o f its high level of
accuracy, ease-of-use and fast
test time, the Bod Pod has
quickly become the method
o f choice for measuring body
composition.”
Cost ranges from $15 to
$25 per appointment for an
assessment by the machine.
Free student and fitness
center member sessions
include fitness assessments

and consultations. The fitness
assessments also are available
to SIUE faculty and staff for
$20 for the complete
assessment and $5 for the
body fat test only.
Following
fitness
assessments or consultations,
personal trainers also are
available to all SIUE students
and SFC members in need o f
a push in the right direction.
Packages o f five and 10 onehour sessions are available.
“ We
offer
personal
trainers for those who don’t
quite know where to start,”
Koenig said. “ (They are)
certified to be personal
trainers, we don’t just have
students come in here non­
trained. They are trained.”
Some students may be
motivated to hit the gym, but
a fear o f not fitting in while
working out keeps a few on
the sidelines. Koenig says the
Wellness Center tries to make
those new to exercise more
confident.
“ We have what I
consider a very diverse
clientele,” Koenig said. “With
students, there are different

share seemingly closet-size dorm
rooms and dining in the vast
Center Court can leave you
feeling lonely and like just
another face in the crowd.
Even
if you’ve
been
counring down the days since
receiving the acceptance letter,
homesickness is common for
students o f all ages.
“Most people don’t like
change very much. Even though
you are looking forward to
getting here, change can still be
difficult,” Counseling Services
Coordinator Sarah Bradbury
said. “ You have to give yourself
time to adjust to it.”
In
the
fall
semester,
Counseling Services sees a
number o f students who suffer
from homesickness, according to
Bradbury. For some cases, she
has a simple prescription.
“One o f the things that we
tell them is to give themselves
some
time
because
that
adjustment to college, especially

for freshmen, is very difficult and
you need to give it some time,”
Bradbury
said.
“Certainly
coming here (to Counseling
Services) and talking to someone
about it is helpful, touching base
with resident assistants, trying to
meet people on their floor is
helpful. Talking to people in
classes is helpful.”
Knowing
someone
on
campus can give a student a head
start with making new friends
and adjusting to a new way o f
life, so,
naturally-outgoing
students may have an initial
advantage over shy students.
“What I’ve generally found
is students who are shier have
more problems,” Bradbury said.
“Because sometimes if you come
here and you already know
somebody, it makes it somewhat
easier than if you come here and
you don’t know anyone.
“I would say we tend to see
(at Counseling Services) those
people who come here and really
don’t have any connections and
sometimes those students who
are really, really close to their
families have trouble ... because
they are so used to having their
families there,” Bradbury said.
“ The harder it is for them to get

back home, the more difficult it
can be.”
Psychology graduate student
Liz Stelter says she did not suffer
from homesickness because of
her participation in campus
organizations.
“It was more excitement.

“...don’t wait to
the point until
it becomes
totally
overwhelming. ”
-Sarah Bradbury,
Counseling Services
Coordinator
The excitement overshadowed
homesickness,” Stelter said. “I
was really involved on campus,
so I was too busy to think about
it.”
While Dara Berman, also a
psychology graduate student,
does admit to calling family
frequently in the early days o f her
college career, she agrees that
involvement does help make

socializing easier.
“Get involved with campus
activities, that helps,” Berman
said. “Go Greek!”
Counseling Services is open
to students who want someone
to talk to about the major life
change, among other things,
such as relationship issues.
A satellite office is available
on the main campus for students
who need to talk but don’t have
access to the main office.
“We have an office in Health
Services for students who can’t
get out here,” Bradbury said.
“ They
may
not
have
transportation, they may be on a
really tight schedule. We have an
office there basically in order to
make us more accessible.”
Typically, there is a 15
session limit for students, but
Bradbury says under some
circumstances that cap can be
waived. Referrals are also
available for students who need
additional help.
“I f there is a problem that it
doesn’t seem we can help a
student with or (the problem is)
beyond what we are able to do
(we can refer them),” Bradbury
said. “Our main concern is that
when a student comes in they can

get the help that they need
whether it be by us or someone
else.”
Bradbury does recommend
that students fill out paperwork
ahead o f appointments if
possible.
For an appointment or more
information, call Counseling
Services at 650-2197. The
Counseling Services main office
is at the junction o f North
University Drive and Lewis
Road and is open from 8 a.m. to
4 :3 0 p.m. M onday through
Friday. Walk-in appointments are
available at the main office only.
I f it is after office hours,
students with emergencies are
urged to call 911.
“Usually what I tell students
is if they are having problems,
don’t wait to the point until it
becomes totally overwhelming.
The sooner you address whatever
the problem is, the easier it is to
find a resolution. Don’t wait even
if it is very scary,” Bradbury said.
“Sometimes just talking about it
helps.”

out if you have questions in making
exercise less intimidating.
“We try to do everything we can to
make it a comfortable environment for
everyone to exercise in,” Koenig added.
Most o f all, Koenig wants to see
students pick up healthy habits in their
first years away from home.
“I think exercise and a focus on
health is something that sometimes gets
put on the back burner when people get
into college and their schedule gets busy
and they have a lot of stress and things
start seeming overwhelming,” Koenig
said. “There is nothing really better than
taking some time for yourself and
utilizing the services we offer to keep
you fit and energized and we are willing
to help in any way we can. I would really
like to see people coming in as freshmen
not getting into bad habits.”

residence halls this fall may help oncampus students get a chance for some
exercise each week without even having

Credit card use
begins early in

While alternative student
loan programs provide students
with an opportunity to get quick
cash for college, borrowing too
much money can leave students
in a sticky financial situation
after graduation.
Unlike federal loans, private
education loans from lenders
like Citibank and Sallie Mae
allow students to borrow for non­
tuition costs such as room and
board.
According to Nellie Mae’s
2002 National Student Loan
Survey, the average cost of
college
is
rising
rapidly.
Meanwhile, federal loan limits
have not been increased in more
than 10 years, causing more
students to turn to private
lenders
to
finance
their
education.
The College Board reports
that students borrowed almost
$10.6 billion in private loans in
2003-04.
Nellie Mae states that "the
total volume of private student

loans has now surpassed the
amounts awarded
annually
under the government-financed
federal student educational
grants, federal work study and
federal Perkins loans programs
combined.”
While private loans offer
students a chance to receive
large amounts of money quickly
and easily, many students may
not realize that interest begins
accumulating while they are still
attending school.
“While it is a small
percentage of students that
borrow from private lenders like
Sallie Mae, those who do turn to
private loans are borrowing quite
heavily,” said Marie O’Malley,
vice president of marketing at
Nellie Mae Corp. and co-author
of the 2002 NSLS in a
statement.
According to the NSLS, the
average undergraduate debt
accumulated by borrowers in
2002 was $18,900, resulting in
a monthly payment of $182 a
month after graduation.
O ’Malley added that as
many as 25 percent of private
loan borrowers feel they have
significant problems with their
education debt after graduation.
The solution? Borrow money
for your education responsibly
and remember, your student
loan payments may be due
sooner than you think.

Final year students carry an average
balance of $2,864, while freshmen
carry an average balance of $1,585.

TENANT

from pg. 26
the next course o f action would
be to seek legal advice and figure
out who is most correct.
Leases usually provide for
when and why the landlord is
allowed on the property, but
usually these provisions require
24 to 48 hours advanced
notification by the landlord and
consent o f the tenant.
Unless there is a visible and
immediate danger to someone on
the property or the property
itself, the landlord must have
permission to enter the rented
property. I f the landlord goes into
the house or apartment without
permission, the landlord can be
arrested for trespassing.
In the case o f renting a
house, if the landlord is on the
property, but not inside the
house, the tenant must first ask
the landlord to leave, and if the
landlord refuses, the police may
then be called and the landlord
arrested for trespassing.
These regulations also apply
to any agent o f the landlord (any
person on the property at the sole
request o f the landlord for any
purpose dealing with
the
property').
If there are any damages to
the property that are not beyond
reasonable wear and tear for the
time the tenant has lived there or
any problems that the landlord is
responsible for fixing, a tenant
may send the landlord a letter
explaining what is wrong and
what needs to be done to fix it.
After 14 days, if the landlord has
not made any reasonable effort to
fix the problem the tenant may
repair and deduct the expense of
the repairs. There are several
other conditions that must be
met, such as the repairs cannot
exceed half o f the monthly rent
amount or $500, whichever is
less, and the repairs must be done

by a certified repairman. A repair
and deduct should be a last
resort. For complete information
on this law see 765 ILCS 742/5.
During any point o f a lease,
the landlord may send a written
notice to terminate the tenancy. If
the lease is a year or longer, this
notice must be given between
four months and 60 days prior to
the termination date. If the lease
is less than one year, the landlord
only needs to provide 30 days
notice. Some leases have a shorter
time period but these are the
minimum required by law. A
landlord needs no reason to
terminate a tenancy in this way.
The Retaliatory Eviction Act
(765 ILCS 720/1) says that a
landlord cannot terminate or
refuse to renew the lease o f a
tenant who has notified any
governmental authority o f a
violation o f the building or health
codes. So if there are any
violations o f the building codes
or health codes in a house or
apartment, the landlord cannot
hold this against the tenant. This
only applies to residential
properties and overrides any
terms in a lease.
When renting a house or
apartment there are many more
things to know about the rights
o f tenants. Landlord-tenant laws
are very specific and most of
them favor the renter, not the
landlord.
A pamphlet on landlordtenant law can be picked up in
the circuit clerk’s office in the
Madison County Courthouse.
When talking with a lawyer
about these issues it is best to be
as honest as possible and
remember that the more they
know, the more they can help.

Hay said that in the event o f

a conflict, she felt students should
try to speak with their roommate
first. She added that if that
doesn’t work, students should
seek help from their RA.
Showalter and Hay agreed
that
communication
is
paramount to avoiding conflict
with a roommate.

Speech Center: Student/Peer Ttitoring, Promoting
Effective Presentation Skills

(EDWARDSVILLE, III.) The Sp eech Center at Southern Illinois University
Edwardsville is designed to help students achieve oral intelligibility by assisting in
strengthening presentation skills and managing presentation anxieties.
The Sp eech Center is staffed by undergraduate student tutors, coordinated by a
Graduate Assistant and managed by the Sp eech Communication Department. The
peer-run center facilitates an environment that promotes self-directed and self­
monitored instruction. The importance of effective public speaking skills both the
written and oral asp ects are often negated in the professional work scen e. The
Sp eech C enters’ mission is to provide students with the opportunity to improve public
speaking and sp eech writing skills.
Self improvement in public speaking is not exclusive to Sp eech Communication
Majors. Engineering, Business, Education, and Nursing are but, a few disciplines that
have taken advantage of the Sp eech Center’s student tutoring session s. Students
are able to plan, develop, and practice presentations for class, business, and
personal use with the guidance of a qualified student tutor.
The Center features a variety of resources computers, tape recorders, audiotapes,
and worksheets that aid in self and peer critique. The resources are effective in
helping students improve presentation structure, flow, visual aides, and nonverbal
communication. Both students whom are required to attend a tutoring session, and
students who have personal points of improvement are encourage to utilize the

MCT helps you get around town
by Matthew Schroyer
Alestle Lifestyles Stringer

To many students, gas does not come
cheap. The growing gas prices are making
a tear in student’s wallets that is hard to
mend.
“I think gas prices are absolutely
ridiculous,” senior French major Aaron
Newcom said. “They keep going up and
up, but my salary is staying the same.
That’s not a good combination.”
Fortunately for some SIU E students,
there are alternatives to transportation.
One such option is the bike trail
system that cuts
through the

scenic Edwardsville landscape. Over 75
miles o f bike trails are maintained by
Madison County Transit, the MCT Web
site states.
SJ Morrison, the assistant director o f
marketing for MCT, said the bike trails
offer much more than getting from point
A to point B.
“Not only are they a mode o f
transportation, but also a great means o f
exercise,” he said. “We like to think o f
them as ‘linear parks.’”
Although trails don’t lead direcdy to
large businesses such as Wal-Mart and
Target, Morrison says one trail leads to

Market Basket, a family-owned grocery
store.
For students who live in downtown
Edwardsville apartments, Morrison said
bike trails give them the option o f riding a
bike to class, forgoing the costs o f a
parking pass.
The MCT bike trails, which are
former railways converted into bike paths,
are by no means a secret.
According to Morrison, the bike trails
were so popular, MCT ran out o f trail
maps this year.
“We are in the process o f reprinting,”
he says. “Right now, people can go on the
MCT trails Web site and find information
and order a map.”
The maps contain information
about points o f interest along the trails
and Morrison expects the new maps to
be available in mid-September.
Bike trails aren’t the only
complementary service offered by MCT.
Every day, MCT gives free rides
between Cougar Village and
Hairpin Drive on bus number 17,
also known as the Cougar Shuttle.
On weekdays, the bus makes a trip
every 10 minutes between Hairpin
Drive and Cougar Village, with a stop
at the Early Childhood Center every
hour.
Freshman CMIS major Jordan
Ronat said the Cougar Shuttle was
handy during the day, but less
practical in the evening, when the
shuttle travels in longer time
intervals.
“I had to get to the bus stop
about 20 minutes before my class
started toward the end o f the semester,”

Ronat said. “Maybe I’m just weird, but
waiting 20 minutes for a three minute ride
to campus just seems silly to me, so I just
walked to class the last couple weeks o f the
semester. It took 15 minutes.”
For students that wish to travel from
SIUE to Edwardsville, Morrison suggests
the number 16 bus, which picks up
students at Hairpin Drive, and makes a
loop around Edwardsville.

“ Last year we were
averaging 2,500
students a day.”
-SJ Morrison,
assistant director of marketing
Morrison said the MCT service has
been very popular with students.
“Last year, we were averaging 2,500
students a day,” he said.
According to its Web site, in addition
to service within Edwardsville, MCT
operates busses to Granite City, Madison,
Venice, Alton, Wood River, the SIUE
School o f Dentistry, Highland, Troy and
St. Jacob.
It is also possible to take an MCT bus
to downtown St. Louis. On weekday
mornings, there will be three trips from
downtown St. Louis to SIU E and four
trips back to St. Louis in the afternoon.

Women’s soccer team thirsty for more success
by Mallory Hensley
Alestle Sports Stringer

The athletes on the SIUE
women’s soccer team are ready to
put their game faces on.
Still riding the adrenaline
rush o f making an appearance at
the NCAA National Tournament
last year, the Cougars are ready to
continue the success they found
in the 2005 season.
With all but five o f the
women on the roster being
returning players, they are
expected to do just that.
Under the direction o f SIUE
Head Coach Lynda Bowers, the
2005 Cougar team set three
school records. SIU E notched 17
victories,
a
feat
never
accomplished in the past. Ten of
those wins were consecutive.
Twelve shutouts pushed the team
into the record books, and the
Cougars
added
to
their
accomplishments 'by notching
129 corner kicks.
“We are coming o ff a really
good year,” Bowers said. “Last
year was the best season we have
ever had in the school’s history.
Expectations for this year are very
high.”
Last vear’s team saw’ four of
its
members

Conference. Two o f those athletes
return to Korte Stadium and are
expected to shine this year.
Kristine Armstrong, co­
captain o f this year’s team, was
an All-Great Lakes Valley
Conference first team selection.
Armstrong was the team’s
leading scorer, netting 12 goals.
She was the second-leading
scorer in the GLVC.
Armstrong’s name appears
in the record books, as she ranks
8th in SIU E’s history with 26
goals scored in her career thus far.
She also is ranked 10th with 62
points. In 2005, Armstrong
scored five game-winning goals,
sealing the deal time and time
again for her team.
“Kristine is a forward and
has been our leading goal scorer
since she was a freshman. She
sees a lot o f action on the field,
and will be a key player for us
again this year. She is very
experienced, and has excellent
leadership skills,” Bowers said.
“The other players, especially
the freshmen, will learn from
her.”

On a personal level, Pacheco
hopes to break the all-time assist
record. He is six assists away
from tying the mark set by
former Co :gar John Carenza in
1974. Yet Pacheco, a midfielder
who hails from Brazil, has his
head on straight and does not
forget what the game is all about.
“I am pleased to know that
people think that I am a good
player,
but
without
my
teammates, I would never be in
this position. I see myself as a
part o f a successful team that has
accomplished a lot in the past few
years,” Pacheco said. “I think that
my teammates have confidence in
my scoring capabilities, and I also
try to meet their expectations.”

the NSCAA/Adidas national poll
every week, excluding the final
two. At that time, the Cougars

Last season, SIUE produced two
All-Americans. Senior Mike
Banner, who was also named to
the All-Great Lakes Region and
All-Conference teams, was on the
first team All-American as a
junior.
“I am so excited to play
along with forward Mike Banner
again because o f his impressive

think that he is one o f the best

SIUE spikers sport look of youth on the hardwood
by Matthew Bruce
Alestle Sports Editor

In the summer o f 2005, the
SIUE volleyball team tacked six
recruits onto its roster, signing
five high school standouts and
one junior college hard hitter.
This summer, the Cougars added
another half-dozen new players.
With the departure o f seven
seniors - including All-American
middle hitter Heather Bonde from a team that finished 28-6
last season and won the Great
Lakes Valley Conference crown,
SIU E’s core o f underclassmen
will need to step up this year for
the Cougars to achieve any
measure o f success.
“It’s an entirely different
team,” SIUE Head Coach Todd
Gober said. “The big thing that
concerns me is that w e’re going
to have an entirely new starting
lineup. So I don’t know exactly

what to expect.”
Gober made it clear that he
did not want his team to try to
pick up where last year’s group,
which advanced to the second
round o f the NCAA Division II
Great
Lakes
Regional
Tournament, left off.
“From what I hear, other
teams are lining up thinking that
they’re going to be smacking us
around this year because we
graduated everybody. A id that’s
going to be our motivation,”
Gober said. “I really don’t want
to focus on being defending
conference champions. I’d rather
just have this group be a whole
new identity, a whole new team.
Forget about whatever we did
last year. Let’s just go out and
create an identity now and let
people know that for the next
three (to) four years in the
conference, this group is going to
be running the show.”

footwork, our offensive systems
and things like that. That’s a
tougher position, it seems like, to
come in and learn, so that’s going
to probably be the area where
we’re slowest to learn and get
quick.”
The duo o f Bonde and Tina
Talsma held down the fort up the
gut for the Cougars last season,
but they departed for graduation.
Bonde was named GLVC
Player o f the Year and All-Great
Lakes Region while Talsma
racked up a team-high 23
blocked shots to go along with
402.5 total points.
“ They were really solid,”
Gober said. “You don’t know
what you have until they’re gone.
And now I’m looking back and
saying wow it was really easy
with those two. I didn’t have to
worry about our middles.”
Gober will look to SIUE
senior Jamie Jones to fill one o f

‘We’re young, but I’ve got a
tremendous amount o f confidence

-Todd Gober,
SIUE Head Coach
One o f the biggest questions
for the Cougars to answer in
2006 will be the gaping hole in
the middle o f their formation.
“One thing I think we’re
really going to have a tougher
time replacing is our middle
(hitters),” Gober said. “It’s going
to take them a while to learn the

the voids in the center and

Intramural sports back and better than ever
by Geoff Schardan
Alestle Sports Stringer

Courtesy of SIUE Photo Services

SIUE students compete in the Intramural Sand Volleyball Tournament at the Cougar Village Sand
Volleyball Court.

When class is over and you
have some energy to burn after
sitting through a long session, try
intramural sports.
Some o f the sports offered
include football, basketball,
hockey, soccer, softball, volleyball
and tennis just to name a few.
There are enough sports that
there is something for everyone.
Whether you want to be in a
league, tournament or a race, IM
sports has it all. The first event is
a 5K run on August 27.
Tournaments start Sept. 6 and
leagues start Sept. 8.
“ The registration dates have
been pushed back a week to give
the first year students extra time
to register,” Campus Recreation
Assistant Director Keith Becherer
said.
During the fall there are 21
events scheduled. They range
from a bass fishing derby to floor

hockey. The new sports this year
are washers, wiffleball and pickle
ball.
During the spring, there will
be 18 events scheduled. There are
also three new sports in the
spring as well: ultimate frisbee,
kickball and 4-on-4 football.
“The most dramatic increase
(in teams) was softball,” Becherer
said. “ Volleyball was second.”
With intramural sports
growing every year, there are
expansions. Scoreboards have
been added to the Rec Plex and
concrete has been poured for
dugouts and a bench area.
A full time position is also
being added for IM programs, so
the personnel can be available at
games and to the students at
other times.
In addition, the number o f
league nights is being increased
so students that work can still
participate.

Students can create their own fun with club sports
by Mallory Hensley
Alesile Sports Stringer

Do you love SIU E , but wish
it had a Frisbee go lf team? What
about speed skating? Your wish
could be the Department
of
Campus
Recreation’s
command.
SIUE offers a host o f club
sports. From the Outdoor
Adventure
Club
to
the
Wakeboard and Water Ski clubs,
Campus Recreation currently
supports 23 diverse teams.
Whether your home is in the
water, on the land or even in the
air, the SIU E Sports Club
reams have a uniform waiting for
you.
But if you and your friends
love playing a sport that SIUE
does not currently offer, have no
fear. You could be well on your
way to beginning a new Cougar
tradition.
The idea o f the club sport
developed in the mid 1800s, but
faded into the background when
varsity sports gained popularity.
One hundred years later, club
sports made a comeback,
popping up at institutions across
the nation. The Club Sports
program was generated at SIUE
to fill the void left by other
recreational
opportunities.
Varsity sports accommodated
only a small number o f athletes,
and intramurals did not offer the
competition that other students
craved. Hence, the SIU E Club
Sports program was born.
“Overall, the goal is to
provide recreational and social
opportunities for students who
have similar likes and interests. It
is a fantastic opportunity for
students to network with people
who have common passions,”
Campus Recreation Assistant
Director Keith Becherer said. “It

program.

is a way for students to get
involved in campus life and to
have a productive extracurricular
activity under their belts.”
The clubs depend greatly on
the initiative o f their student
members and their ability to
organize and handle finances.
The program provides a setting

in which the students learn
executive skills, as well as reap the
benefits o f instruction in their
specific sport.
“I think that the Club Sports
program is ran extremely well.
We really do have pretty much a
program for just about anybody
interested in just about anything.

I know that Keith Becherer and
everyone
else
at
the
administrative end strive to
provide
opportunities
for
everybody,”
Club
Football
President Jon Shumaker said. “If
we don’t have a club sport in
existence, and there is interest,
the school is ready and willing to

support it. That is just amazing.”

“ Phase two will be adding

The meeting is to approve
the expansions and set dates for

will be multi-purpose and used
for speakers, concerts and as an

Students that plan to have a

provide strength from their
respective positions. Hofeldt, a
right-side hitter, garnered an AllGLVC honorable mention nod
last year and Clements, who was
the team’s setter during the
spring season, was second in the
GLVC in service aces with a total
'o f 59.
“Mallory has the potential to
be an All-Region caliber player,”
Gober said. “She’s got the ability
to throw up a triple-double every
single night. That doesn’t happen
very often.
“ She’s one o f our big
bangers,” Gober said o f Hofeldt.
“She can put the ball down. She
jumps really well. (Hofeldt is a)
powerful player.”
SIUE senior Tricia Happe
and SIUE junior Kim Potthast
will serve as team captains,
supplying the squad with some
leadership. Potthast is coming off
o f surgery on both o f her knees
for the second consecutive
season.
“ She’s a tough young lady,”

Gober said about Potthast. “It’s
going to be a trying year for her.
She’s all excited to go. I think
she’s going to have a great year.”
Newcomers to the Cougar
lineup are four freshmen (Tiffany
Turner, Lauren Spencer, Lisa
Heitkamp, Candace Kummer),
an NCAA Division I transfer
(Kelsey Hubert) and junior
college standout Ruth Shurts.
“ We had
a
big-sized
recruiting class,” Gober said.
“We’ve got three girls that are
6 ’ 1” or above out o f this class.
“We do have big bangers,”
he added. “We’ve got some girls
that can hit the ball and jump
really well. But I think it’s going
to be a really exciting type o f
volleyball here.”
One bright spot for SIUE
going into the fall is the 8-4 mark
that they put up in the spring
season competing largely against
Division I schools such as Austin
Peay University, which the
Cougars beat twice.
“I was impressed at the

chemistry I saw between the
young ladies on the team,” Gober
said. “We weren’t the biggest
team this spring, we weren’t the
most powerful. But they just
competed exceptionally well.
They didn’t get rattled. They kept
pushing, they kept fighting
(and) they kept doing the little
things. It was really fun to watch
them.”
The Cougars get to show
what they’ve got when they kick
o ff the season in the North
Alabama Tournament against
Albany State University at 10
a.m. Friday, Aug. 25 in Florence,
Ala.
“We’re young, but I’ve got a
tremendous
amount
of
confidence in these girls,” Gober
said. “Great work ethic, they’ve
got great attitudes. I think it’s
one o f the most competitive
returning group o f players I’ve
ever coached.”

were also ranked fifth in the
number o f saved shots on goal at
.855.
“Everybody has been willing
to fight for each other on the
field. That is what makes us a
good team,” Pacheco said. “I
think that last year’s upsets have
brought us even closer to each

other, which will really help this
year.”
The soccer season kicks off
with a home game against Fort
Lewis on Aug. 25 at Korte
Stadium.

SIUE completed the 2005
season as one o f the best Division

Cougars had a .62 shutout

switching from playing back in
2004. Fromme was third on the
team with five goals. Her shot
percentage, .333, and shots on
goal percentage, .800, were the
highest on the team.
Padra Bencini, a senior back,
will be the co-captain alongside
Armstrong. Bencini was named
to the 2005 Academic AllDistrict V College Division first
team.
“Padra has played just about
every minute o f every game since
she was a freshman,” Bowers
said. “She and Armstrong will
anchor our lineup and should do
a great job leading the team both
on and off the field.”
Freshmen Jessica Bretana,
Maria Culp, Kelley Humphrey,

Sarah Lockhart and Correen
Roark will be new faces on the
field this year. Bowers said she
expects the freshmen players to
step up and make an immediate
impact on the team.
“We were fortunate last year
to have such a great young team.
They were all capable o f being
starters,” Bowers said. “This is
not a rebuilding year. We are just
going to reload and come back
even stronger than last year.”
SIU E’s season opener is an
away game against Missouri
Southern State University at 11
a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 26th in
Joplin, Mo.

Some dreams are universal: hitting a

ball over the Green Monster; winning the
World Series with a Grand Slam in the bottom
of the ninth inning. Finding out that you have
MS is not one of them.
Multiple sclerosis is a devastating disease
of the central nervous system where the
body's immune system attacks the
insulation surrounding the herves.
It strikes in the prime of life - ano
changes lives forever.
The National MS Society funds
more research and provides more
services for people with MS than

\

any MS organization in the world.
But we can’t do it alone.
To help make the dream of
ending MS come true, visit us
online at national

society.org,

or call 1-800-FIGHT MS.

“The Club Sports program
rewards you for your effort. If
they see you are doing all you
can, as far as fundraising and
improving your sport, they are
willing to reward that effort by
increasing the support from the
university,” Shumaker said. “ That
has helped the football program
out immensely.”
The teams can be purely
competitive or for recreation.
Many o f the clubs travel across
the country to compete against
other schools or organizations.
Some o f the competitive SIUE
club teams are the football and
hockey teams.
“I love being in a club. I have
made some great friends, and it
seems like each semester I make
more and m ore,” Hybrid
Movements Club President Kyle
Fuhrmann said. “A lot o f
friendships that I have developed
within the club have turned into
friendships
that
continued
outside o f the club, and even
have led to a few job
opportunities.”
Any group o f eight or more
students can apply to organize a
team with Club Sports status. To

be considered an SIUE-affiliated
club, the students must first turn
in a petition demonstrating their
interest in beginning a club.
Next, the students meet with a
committee
of
Student
Government members, where
they are instructed to make a
constitution
for
their
organization. Once a president,
vice
president
and
secretary/treasurer are selected,
the officers complete a packet o f
registration forms and submit
them to the Department o f
Campus Recreation.
“The administration is great.
Everything falls under Keith
(Becherer). He’s a really great
and understanding guy,” Tae
Kwon Do Hapkido Club
President Cory Fourqurean said.
“As an officer, I submit a lot o f
forms and waivers. The SIUE
program is a good way to get Tae
Kwon Do training for very
cheap. It’s a great deal. They are
always trying to add new clubs.
It’s a great thing to get involved
in.”
Club sports commence as
soon as school starts. The Morris
University Center will act as a
grand market for anyone looking
for extracurricular activities to get

involved with.
“We w ill have tables at
Welcome Week in the M UC
where the executive council and
representatives from each club
will pass out information on
practice times and where teams
meet,” Becherer said. “Students
are encouraged to just show up at
practices and get a feel for the
teams that way. Most o f the clubs
have scheduled meetings, which
will be advertised via flyers all
over campus.”
Participation in club sports is
a way to keep students mentally
and physically fit, while expanding
their social networks and helping
them develop life skills.
“ The biggest thing is to
promote growth. The strength o f
some o f the clubs is a testament
and credit to the students who
run them. When given the
opportunity, students become
great leaders,“ Becherer said. “It
is exciting to see the progression
o f people who rise up from the
ranks and become officers in the
clubs. That is an exciting
and rewarding result o f club
sports.”
