Children at S IU E ’s Early Childhood
C e n te r h opped into the fight against
leukem ia yesterday by helping to raise
m oney for the Illinois C hapter of the
Leukem ia Society’s “Anim als T hat H op”
program .
Pledges and flat m onetary contributions
were collected by children for the num ber
of hops that they did in a two-m inute span.
A lthough it is not known at this time
how m uch m oney was raised for the
program that benefits leukem ia research
and patient-aid for those afflicted by the
disease, last y e a r’s hop-a-thon raised
around $1,000.
Each child who participated in the H op
will receive a special certificate of
achievement.
Little gifts will be given to the children
who stood out in the Hop, such as the one
who hopped the most and the person who
collected the most money.

BOT transfers SIU dental
school parking lot to CMS
By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
Effective Feb. 8, the B oard of T rustees approved the
transferred ownership of a nine-acre lot used at the A lton
dental school over to the Illinois D epartm ent of C entral
M anagem ent Services (CMS).
Sam Sm ith, d irecto r o f News Services, said th at the
university has no further use for the property and that there is
adequate parking for visitors and students.
Smith went on to explain that the lot was located at the
eastern extrem ity of the campus and that closer parking was
available for students.
The land was acquired by the B oard of Trustees as part of
the Shurtleff College properties. Originally leased to the board
in 1957, it was subsequently purchased in 1972.
“Since the land was not sold by the university,” Smith said,
“but simply turned over to CMS, which controls stale property,
the dental school cannot decide how the land will be used.”
CMS will m ake use of the property as it deem s appropriate,
residential developm ent being m ost likely if the property is
sold.
Smith said that residential developm ent in the area will not
affect the dental school.

Hop-A-Thon-----------------------------------Boulder blocking tunnel is blasted on fourth try
• Work crews in northern Japan last Wednesday blasted to bits a giant
boulder the size of a 20-story building that crushed a highway tunnel. But it
may still take days of digging to reach any survivors in a bus and car that
were trapped in the tunnel. The rock slide trapped 20 people inside—19 on
the bus and one in the car. Little hope is held for survivors: anyone surviving
the blast would have now spent five days and nights in freezing
temperatures.

Leukem ia is a disease of the blood-forming tissues: the bone

disease killer of children today.
Significant progress has been m ade through research, and
with continued funding, researchers believe they can find a
cure by the year 2000.
Nationally, the Leukem ia Society of A m erica contributed

In Illinois, over $181,000 will be used this year for leukemia

letter to the editor.

Don't mess with the Steve and D.C. morning show
In a Feb. 13 letter to the editor, Professor Farley castigated the
Steve and D C radio show for being racists. To simply write off
Steve and D C as racists and to com pare them to the Ku Klux Klan
is a little shallow—especially for a college professor.
Yes, Steve and D C did use the “N ” word on the air in May of
1993. They were wrong. For that mistake, they w ere fired and kept
off the airwaves for eight m onths. D uring their hiatus, they
attended sensitivity training courses which helped them see the
error of their ways.
The N A A C P forgave Steve and D C and accepted their return
to St. Louis radio. If the local N A A C P chapter did not believe
Steve and D C to be sufficiently rehabilitated and apologetic, Steve
and D C would not be back on the air.
I am interested in Farley’s position on hiring an ex-convict that
the state deems to be sufficiently rehabilitated and apologetic.
Does Farley really believe the old axiom, “Once a criminal, always
a crim inal?”
In regards to why the Alestle dedicated so much space to the
Steve and D C show, the answer is simply because the Alestle was
appealing to its readers. W hether or not Farley adm its it, the Steve
and D C show is the num ber-one rated m orning radio show in St.
Louis in the 18-30 dem ographic age group. It logically follows that
the Alestle would offer stories that pertain to the interests of its
readers.
I would venture to say that Farley has never listened to the
Steve and D C show since their return to radio in January of 1994.
Racial topics and issues are no longer (and never really w ere) a
part of their program . Steve and D C now offer a “kinder and
gentler,” albeit funnier, show.
I would ask that Farley listen to the Steve and D C show before
condemning it. W hen is the last time Siskel and E bert gave a
movie a thum bs down before viewing it?
Should Farley actually listen to the Steve and D C show, I
believe we would find him snickering a time o r two. If not, he
would at least be forced to adm it that Steve and D C are far from
the KKK card-carrying racists that he m akes them out to be.
D o n ’t mess with my boys!
John Huelskamp
Political Science

I would like to thank Professor John Farley for his
letter to the editor. It’s im portant to receive input on
what readers think of our pages; it helps us do our jobs.
W hat does not help, however, is when readers write in
and pass judgem ent on our m aterial, m aking uncalled for
assumptions.
The story on the Steve and D C show was not w ritten
to prom ote two guys who were at one time (three years
ago, to be exact) banned from the airwaves for using, as
Commentary
Farley put it, ‘the “N ” w ord’ on the air. I do not believe
that A N Y O N E should use that word, or any o th er racial
By Jennifer Casey
slur, when referring to a hum an being. However, the
N A A C P found that Steve and D C should be allowed
back on the air in January of 1994. If the N A A C P could find it in them selves to forgive
Steve and DC, then listeners should consider doing the same.
The story was w ritten because these two guys have the num ber-one m orning radio
show in St. Louis and th ere’s a reason for that. People like them , and many of these
people are SIU E students and yes, even faculty. It was not a one-sided kiss-up story. If
you really read it, you’d see that there were several references to problem s they’ve
encountered in their eight years of partnership, along with the high points.
If you don’t like them, D O N ’T LISTEN! It’s that simple! T hey’ll be fine! R adio
personalities have been surviving criticism for decades— How ard Stern hasn’t thrown in
the towel after all these years of being called every immoral nam e in the book.
C om pared to Stern, Steve and D C are saints! T hey’re also, like Stern, what listeners want
to hear.
As far as the Alestle printing a “cheerful” story on the KKK—we did run a column last
sem ester that downright ridiculed and adm onished such practices. My advice in that area
is to check your facts, sir.
The section at the end of the Steve and D C story thanking them for the great interview
was totally on target. I spent the m orning on the air with crew m em bers, and I can
honestly say that it was one of the most entertaining, fun, and educational experiences
that I, as a TV /R and journalism major, could possibly have. T hat was w hat I m eant by
great.
If you, Professor Farley—or anyone else for that m atter—do not approve of the subject
m atter on which a story is based, then turn the page. D o n ’t read it. W e’ll never know.

“ Several people in the

atten d
the
conference,”
C ooper said.
R egarding
the
paper
com petition, C ooper said, “It
is a nationwide audience, and
papers are en tered from
faculty and students from all
over. T hat is what m akes the
fact that we won so much
m ore special.”
The Broadcast Education
A ssociation
C onference
receives copies of papers
from universities nationwide,
and each paper received is
judged in various divisions,
Smith said.
T he divisions are: Law and
Policy, Technology, G ender
Issues and History.
T he copies are then judged
on content, and the papers
d eem ed
the
best
are
presented by the authors at
the conference, Smith said.
“It’s neat that we won,” she
said. “It’s not usually a grad
student who gets to do the
presenting.”
Smith also said that she is
excited about going to the
conference because of a job
fair that will be conducted
during the conference.
Sm ith is planning to

Impressionistic cover art from 13 Mg.'s latest release, 'Trust and Obey"

By Lenon Maguire
Lifestyle Reporter
Trust and Obey is the new album from 13 Mg. on SlipDisc R ecords out of
Chicago. They are a goth/industrial band also from Chicago fronted by H. Beno,
who is known for his previous work with other industrial band/artists.
B eno has produced and rem ixed such acts as the Red Hot Chili Peppers,
M onster Voodoo Machine, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and the always
entertaining G race Jones. H e got his start, and is best known, for his work with
A1 Jorgenson as a program m er/editor on the Ministry album Psalm 69 .
Beno started 13 Mg. as a rotating project that would allow him to work with
a variety of artists, m ost notably B rian Liesgang, who is currently in the band
Filter.

fo r

b u c k

Trust and Obey starts with a lot of noise, which you would expect from a band
with this history. It then turns into a blend of sampling machines, buzzing guitars
and dance rhythm, like any other industrial album. A t many points, the overall
sound and samples sounded to me like a cross betw een Psalm 69 and Pretty Hate
M achine, which should be a good thing since they are both great albums.
Unfortunately, this recording doesn’t have the variety that made Psalm 69
and Pretty Hate Machine so great. By the fifth track, the songs seem to bleed
together to the point where one song is indistinguishable from the next. By the
time the album was over, I was ready to reload the CD player.
The problem with this album is that it is not as good as it could be. It does,
however, have the potential for at least one or two hit singles. In a town where
the song “Guilty” still gets constant airplay on the Point, there can be a place for
13 Mg. If the station likes the band, they’ll push the single, and then you’ll
probably get to see them at a $1.05 Point show. Once the show is over, they will
drop them from the play-list like they do so many o th er bands.
Live, the band is m ore like Skinny Puppy or KMFDM than they are Ministry
or Nine Inch Nails. They play with a massive stack of amps which makes your
chest vibrate as you try to watch the rail-thin Beno scream and taunt the
audience through thick clouds of smoke. The live show definitely sounds harder
and is m ore entertaining than the album.
I was fortunate enough to see them last Saturday when they perform ed at the
Galaxy with Cradle of Thoms and Visions o f Passion and Torture. I was
fortunate because I was introduced to a new band, Cradle of Thorns. Their debut
album is on Triple X R ecords entitled Download This, and should be available
this week. This band out of southern California is recom m ended if you like the
style similar to Rage Against the Machine. The band is in some ways similar, but
not as choppy. If Helmet went rap, they would sound much like C radle of Thorns
does.
If you are tired of waiting for the Gravity Kills album, pick up Trust and Obey,
because the sound, at times, is very similar. If you like tb ■ album, and you’re
lucky, you can see 13 Mg. the next time they come to town for a buck.

‘The Boys Next Door’ premieres this weekend
Paul Lartonoix returns to
the SIUE director’s chair

he said. “It’s a touching, warm play with a message and th at’s why I was
attracted to it.”
Audiences may recall Lartonoix’s SIU E directing debut with The Foreigner
staged in 1989. “I don’t direct often but when I find a show I really love, I
submit it,” he said. “T hat’s why I did The Foreigner and th at’s why I’m doing
The Boys N ext D oor . The two plays are similar in their warm th and comedy, a

University News Services
Press Release

com bination which appeals to me.” Lartonoix spends m ost of his time teaching
technical theater and designing for o th er directors in the SIU E departm ent of
theater and dance.

Tom G riffin’s The Boys N ext D oor is a touching and funny tale that explores
the adage about who is sane and who should be institutionalized. It’s also far
m ore than that and audience m em bers can decide for them selves when the play
is staged at 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, Feb. 16-17, 23-24, and at 2 p.m.
Sunday, Feb. 25, all in the Com m unications Building theater at SIUE.
D irector Paul L artonoix says Griffin has presented a two-act comedy about
four men who are m entally disabled but who also have a lot of love and
compassion. They are living in a group home, supervised by their social worker,
Jack Palm er, who is trying to guide them as they “m ainstream ” into society. The
men have various degrees of genetic deficiencies, from patterns of ongoing
childishness to com plicated wounds. T here’s A rnold, who is very nervous;
Lucien, who is slow of wit but articulate in his mind; Norm an, a lover of
doughnuts who wants very much to be com fortable with Sheila; and Barry, a
meticulous dresser with a schizophrenic obsession for golf.
They are functional m en With disabilities and this is one of the crux of
Griffin’s point, Lartonoix says. “These four are people first, but they have
deficiencies,” Lartonoix said. “But,they are less hum an because of it? O f course
not. A nd, Jack finds this out because he learns the most from the four men.
They are colorful characters, which m akes the play very funny and charming,”

As to the technical side of The Boys N ext Door, Lartonoix is surrounding
himself with many talented student designers from the departm ent who are
concentrating on the colorfulness of the characters. “The contrast between the
drab world as we see it and the colorful nature of these characters will be
explored by the various design elem ents, scenery (D an G eidem an of
Belleville), lighting (A nn A nderson of Edwardsville), sound (Becky Wells
Casperson of G ranite City), and costum e designs (Assistant Professor Jack
Smith),” he said. “W e’ll be invoking em otional responses in the audience
mem bers as they realize that these m en are disabled only mentally. Their spirit
is still strong.”
“W e’ll need to see these characters as hum an beings who love and care and
who have feelings for each other,” Lartonoix said. “T here’s a lesson here in that
as we encounter people with disabilities in actual life, we need to apply the
same compassion. I like what Lucien says: ‘I am here to rem ind the species of
the species.’ I think th at’s one of G riffin’s messages to us all.”
Tickets for The Boys Next D oor are $6; students, senior citizens, and SIU E
faculty and staff, as well as children under 12 years of age, $4.50. For more
inform ation o r to order tickets, call the SIU E Fine A rts Box Office at (618)6922774, or, from St. Louis toll-free (314)621-5168, Ext. 2774.

Cougar men set to host defending national champs
By Eli Savoie
Sports Editor

Jeremy Paschal!/Alestle
The SIUE Cougars will need to turn in a strong effort
tonight to knock off GLVC leader Southern Indiana.

“ I like when the ball is in my hands at the end
of the game. It doesn’t bother me at all.” Those
are the words of M arcus D earing and, thankfully
for the Cougars, the ball was in M arcus’ hands a
few times late in the gam e last Saturday night.
The Cougars couldn’t climb all the way out of
the hole they dug themselves, but D earing sure
m ade it interesting with 45 seconds left in the
game and the C ougars trailing the University of
W isconsin-Parkside 57-65. D earing got the ball
and nailed a triple to bring the Cougars to within
five.
“ It was still a two possession gam e so the team
d idn’t have a real positive attitude,” M arcus said.
But D earing w asn’t done yet. A fter a free
throw m ade by Parkside, D earing tro tted down
and hit an o th er trifecta. Now the Cougars only
trailed 63-66 with 29 seconds left. M arcus said the
rollercoaster o f em otions continued from there.
“W hen I hit the second three, I thought we had
a chance. But then their best free-throw shooter
got the ball and we had to foul him. A fter he hit
one, it was back to a four-point gam e and we knew
it would be tough.”
E ven though the Cougars couldn’t com e back
against Parkside, there is m ore exciting basketball
to be played at the V.C.
The C ougars host defending D ivision II
N ational Champions, Southern Indiana. The team
needs your support and D earing prom ises an
exciting game.
“Southern Indiana will let us score 121 points as
long as they score 122,” D earing said.

The SIU E m en’s basketball team will have their
work cut out for them tonight when the defending
N C A A -D ivision II national cham pions, the
Screaming Eagles of Southern Indiana, m ake a
visit to the V adalabene Center.
USI comes into the contest in first place in the
G reat Lakes Valley Conference and ranked sixth
nationally with an 18-3 overall record and a 12-2
conference mark.
The Cougars go to battle with a
9-11 overall record and a 6-9 record
in the GLVC that puts them in a tie
for seventh place.
A lthough the Cougars suffered
a 109-83 defeat to the Eagles
earlier this season, head coach Jack
M arg en th aler d o esn ’t think his
team needs to m ake any drastic
changes in their game plan.
“We just need to keep doing the things w e’ve
been doing, but better,” M argenthaler said in
explaining his team ’s game plan.
M argenthaler said he thought the first game
betw een the two clubs this season came down to
USI just being a deeper team.
In that game, the Cougars trailed by only a
couple points with just over three m inutes left in
the first half, before the Eagles overpow ered the
tiring C ougar team.

W ho was that masked woman? That’s what
some asked after the Lady Cougars roared past
W isconsin-Parkside on Saturday night.
H ie answer to that question is also the m em ber
of this w eek’s C ougar C orner. It’s Alicia Harkins.
H arkins had to w ear a protective m ask in
S aturday night’s gam e to prevent harm ing a
broken nose she suffered Thursday night against
Lewis. In the 12 m inutes she played in the Lewis
game, before being injured, Alicia exploded for 10
points.
“ It’s a straight break of the nose so I don’t have
to get it reset. I’m going to get it looked at after
the season,” H arkins said. “I have to w ear the
mask for the rest of the season. It protects my nose
from getting hit.”
The broken nose happened when H arkins
challenged a shot from a Lewis player, and when
the player came down, so did h er forearm —right
on H arkins’ nose. H arkins adm itted the mask was
a distraction.
“ I practiced with it Friday and my first shot was
a brick. It’s tough to focus. I lie thing kind o f m akes
me go cross-eyed. It’s hard to see the ball coming
to me, especially bounce passes,” she said.
So after all this, one would figure she’d be a bit
off on Saturday night, right?
Wrong. The Phantom o f the V.C. had h er usual
solid perform ance with 18 points and 4 rebounds.
Hey Coach H edberg, do you think we can get
ab o u t 10 m ore m asks for the gam e against
Southern Indiana? We could use a few m ore
players with those numbers.
•By Andy Korbesmeyer

“ In th e second half, they ju st physically
m anhandled us,” M argenthaler said.
USI features a very talented squad led by 6foot-9 senior forw ard C had G ilb ert who is
averaging nearly 18 points and eight rebounds a
contest and has been the GLVC player of the week
four times this season.
G ilbert, while spending most of his time under
the basket, also has the ability to step outside and
hit the three. His versatility will pose problem s for
the Cougars.
“W hoever guards him will have to
be able to guard him in both areas,
but we will be sure to run help at him
down low,” M argenthaler said. “We
can’t pay attention to just one guy,
though.”
The Cougars come into the game
led by their leading scorer, junior
guard Jason Holm es. Holm es,,
averaging 17.8 points a game, has hit
43 three-point shots this season.
For the Cougars to repeat last year’s 124-105
victory o v er U SI at the V adalabene C enter,
M argenthaler said his team needs to take their
tim e and w ork to get a good shot on every
possession.
M argenthaler said he would like to keep the
high-scoring Eagles (97 ppg) som ewhere around 70
points. If they can do that, he feels his team has a
very good chance for the upset.

Lady Cougars look
to clip Eagles' wings
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
The last time SIUE and Southern Indiana met, the
outcome was decided in the waning moments of the game
which the Screaming Eagles pulled out 76-74. That was in
the third game o f the season.
The two teams collide again tonight, when the 14-7
Cougars will try to contain preseason All-American LeAnn
Freeland, try to break the Screaming Eagles’ press that hurt
them the first time and keep a hand in the face of their
deadly three point shooters.
“We can’t stop her (Freeland). She is going to get her
points, but we will try to contain her as much as we can. But
the problem of focusing everything on her is that they have
several other players who can hurt you just as bad,” head
coach Wendy Hedberg said in her office Wednesday
afternoon.
Freeland is second in the Great Lakes Region with a 20.5
average and also second in field goal percentage by making
58 percent o f her shots. Along with her is teammate Deb
Pope, who makes 42 percent of her three point shots. That
puts her in third place in the region.
The Cougars will probably go with a man-to-man
defense to hopefully stop the Screaming Eagles from getting
good looks behind the three point line.
While worrying about Southern Indiana’s threats, the
Cougars will have to figure out how to step it up early on
offense. Lately Hedberg has been happy with the way her
team has played, but the shots just have not fallen in.
“We are doing the things we want to do, but we just
aren’t hitting are shots. The game with Southern Indiana
will be a fast paced game, so we shouldn’t have any trouble
getting off to a good start.” Hedberg said.
The Cougars will not focus on one major aspect of the
Screaming Eagles— they just want to go out and play a good
solid game.
“We just have to play well. We have to pick good shot
selections and take care of the ball. But the key is to handle
the press. Last game we turned the ball over a lot of times in
crucial moments, so we just have to take care of the ball
better,” Hedberg said.
