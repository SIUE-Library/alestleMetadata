O n Jan. 22, a new organization will hold its first m eeting in
an attem p t to increase S IU E ’s graduation rate. The
organization, which has no official nam e as of yet, is headed by
student senator R andy Hobson.
H obson has been active in prom oting the organization with
pam phlets and fliers around campus.
“I am certainly satisfied with the efforts thus far on this
project. We have had m oral and other types of support from
the (university) staff and faculty. The adm inistration has
considered the organization a part of its retention initiative
program ,” H obson said.
H obson said that the official nam e for the organization will
be chosen at the Jan. 22 meeting. For now, the group is known
as the Student M entoring Association. Students who attend
the organizational m eeting will choose the official name.
H obson said he sees the need for m entoring those incoming
students throughout their college career at SIU E so that they
are less reluctant to leave when they graduate.
“Students who come here to get a degree need to be given
a chance to succeed. Em pirical data has shown that peer
m entoring by upperclassm en for freshm en increases the
num ber of freshm en returning for the second year—thus
im proving the retention rate,” H obson said.
U niversity C enter D irector Mary Robinson is also an
adviser for the new group. She was chosen for the position on
Nov. 21.

Louis. B am bara died in D ecem ber, at age 56, after a three-year battle with

T he m em orial was, in the words of Eugene R edm ond, “a transition into
ancestorhood for Toni. We come, we salute, we reflect.”
A native of New York City, B am bara was a novelist, editor, short story writer,
filmmaker, educator and activist. O ver a 25-year career in writing and publishing,
B am bara’s stories and essays appeared in the M assachusetts Review, R edbook,
Essence and Prairie Schooner.

published in 1970 and included works by prom inent authors M aya Angelou, Toni
M orrison and Nikki Giovanni.
B am bara published two collections of short stories, “Gorilla My Love” (1972)
and “T he Sea Birds A re Still Alive” (1977). Shortly after leaving her post as
writer-in-residence at Spelm an College, Bam bara published her first novel, “The

Rape suspect’s mother wants trial in the U.S.
•The mother of a U.S. Marine charged with raping a 12-year-old girl is going all the
way to Japan’s Supreme Court with her campaign to move his trial off the island of
Okinawa, officials said Tuesday.
The appeal by Barbara Cannon is expected to delay final arguments in the rape case
at least a week.
Cannon, the mother of Pfc. Kendrick Ledet, of Waycross, Ga., filed the appeal
Monday, said Hidekatsu Shinjo, a spokesman for the district court in the Okinawan
capital of Naha, where the trial is being held.
On Friday, an appeals court rejected Cannon’s earlier petition for a change of venue.
She had argued that outrage in Okinawa over the rape puts pressure on the three
judges to convict and harshly sentence Ledet and two other American servicemen.

Trying to keep the
federal payroll rolling
W A SHINGTO N (A P )— It never hurts to plan ahead, so
federal w orkers’ unions are asking a judge to rule that
employees shouldn’t be forced to work w ithout pay if the
budget stalem ate leads to an o th er partial governm ent
shutdown.The governm ent m ade good on its prom ise to give
late paychecks to em ployees declared essential and kept on
the job during the latest shutdow n.B ut th at’s not enough, say
the National Treasury Em ployees U nion and the Am erican
F ederation of G overnm ent Em ployees. The unions argue
that requiring federal em ployees to w ork w ithout pay
violates the C onstitution, even if their salaries are paid after
a shutdown is resolved.A nd the unions want a federal judge
to rule on the issue before Jan. 26 the day the latest
tem porary funding m easure runs out. "W e don’t want this
situation to keep coming up over and over again,” says
G regory O ’D uden, the N T E U ’s lawyer. "E v en though
people have been paid, the law that led to this situation is
still on the books.’’The unions say the late paychecks didn’t
adequately reim burse em ployees who had to take out highinterest loans to pay household expenses o r who had their
power shut off for nonpaym ent of bills.The unions lost a
round in the fight earlier this m onth when U.S. District
Judge Em m et G. Sullivan refused to issue a tem porary order
that would have barred the governm ent from keeping
480,000 em ployees on the job w ithout paychecks.The judge
said such an o rd er would lead to chaos.Sullivan plans to hear
argum ents Thursday on the overall validity of the unions’
claim. Their argum ent is som ewhat arcane, and it’s far from
certain the judge will see things their way.The unions rely on
the C onstitution’s requirem ent that " n o m oney shall be
draw n from the Treasury, bu t in consequence of
ap p ro p riatio n s m ade by law ” in o th er w ords, by
Congress.The unions contend that m eans the governm ent
cannot create an obligation to pay federal em ployees if no
m oney has been appropriated. Even if such an obligation
were allowed, there m ust be limits on w hat the governm ent
can spend, they say.The C linton adm inistration says
Congress can authorize the governm ent to incur debts, and
it has done so through a federal law called the AntiDeficiency Act. U nder that law, the governm ent cannot
"em ploy personal services exceeding that authorized by law
except for em ergencies involving the safety of hum an life or
the protection of property.” R equiring the em ployees to
tem porarily work w ithout pay am ounts to incurring a debt
the governm ent has prom ised to pay, the adm inistration
contends.Justice D epartm ent lawyers also can argue that the
issue is m oot because the most recent shutdown has been
resolved and the workers have been paid. The unions hope
to persuade Sullivan to decide the case on the ground the
issue could arise again.Constitutional law experts are divided
on the issue.Yale law professor Kate Stith says she thinks the
unions have a valid argum ent that, in requiring 480,000
people to work this m onth w ithout pay, the governm ent went
far beyond its authorization to keep operating during
emergencies." Having such a broad exception, by perm itting
so much (governm ent work) to continue, Congress and the
president are avoiding the pressure the C onstitution
intends” to control governm ent spending by requiring
appropriations, Stith said.H arvard law professor Laurence
Tribe says the unions’ argum ent is " n o t frivolous, but in the
end it is not very convincing.’’T he specific issue raised by the
unions has not been decided by a court, but Tribe says
rulings in o th er cases support the general idea that Congress
can allow the executive branch to create financial obligations
w ithout an ap p ro p riatio n .U n iv ersity of C hicago law
professor M ichael M cConnell says he doesn’t think the
unions have standing to argue over how the governm ent
decides to pay them .'T f they don’t like the term s and
conditions of their em ploym ent, they can quit,” he said.
"T hey are in the same position as em ployees in financially
troubled corporations who may or may not be paid.’’Sullivan
hasn’t tipped his hand on how he will rule. H e said from the
bench earlier this m onth that he was sym pathetic to the
unpaid w orkers’ plight.But the judge also said, "M y role is
not to merely apply leverage to a budget impasse that exists
between the elected officials of governm ent and then hope
for the best to em erge as a result of my decision”

“W e’re here to send Toni Cade on. Even though she lost
her battle to cancer, she won the fight of immortality in her
literature,” Evon U doh, m em ber of the R edm ond Club,
said.
“She had a reciprocal spirit of sharing and giving. Toni
through her works was a healer,” U doh said.
C astro said he saw the political fight and urging in
B am bara’s works.
“Toni saw both laughter and com bat as essential to her as

Thirty-nine arrested at Valparaiso frat party
VALPARAISO , Ind. (A P )—Police arrested 39
people, m ost of them Valparaiso University students,
after breaking up an underage drinking party at the
Sigma Pi fraternity house.
Valparaiso police said everyone under 21 who
tested positive for alcohol consum ption o r who
showed signs of intoxication was arrested on charges
of underage drinking Friday night.
Valparaiso Police Sgt. Rich Spicer said the 39
arrests is the m ost he can recall at a single party in

students arrested, but that a student group hosted the
party, D ean of Students Tim othy Jenkins said.
Jenkins called Sigma Pi headquarters to alert
national fraternity officials of the arrests. The group
has 72 hours to begin investigating the case. Their
investigation can last up to 30 days, after which they
will recom m end how the local fraternity should be
punished.
T he university estim ates it will decide on a
reprim and in two to four weeks, Jenkins said.
“T he chapter will be held accountable,” he said.
“But it is too early to figure out how.”

Foreign student enrollment drops
steadily at University of Iowa
IOW A CITY, Iowa (A P)— It used to be that foreign students would flock to Am erican
universities. Not anymore.
A declining num ber of foreign students at the University of Iowa is a trend that will likely
continue, school officials said.
“It has hit a plateau, so to speak,” said John Rogers, a university foreign-student adviser.
International-student enrollm ent at Iowa has been declining steadily for the past four years,
and nationwide it isn’t growing nearly as quickly as it did just a few years ago.
In 1990,1,925 international students were enrolled at Iowa; last year, 1,672. Even fewer were
expected on campus when classes resum ed for the spring sem ester this week.
For students such as A ndar Wadi, a graduate student from Indonesia, it’s Am erican know-how
that takes them so far from
home.
“A m erica is a developed
co untry
and m ine is a
developing country, so we can
learn a lot here,” Wadi said.
But the rest of the world is
catching up, Rogers said, and
th at is one reason for the
decline.
“ H igher-education system s
are b e tte r developed now,”
Rogers said. “T here are more
colleges and universities that
provide quality education.”
Rogers said economics plays
a big part, too.
“ It used to be that a person
with a U.S. degree could always
find a job when they went back
home. Nowadays, because the
economies d on’t allow for such
a great expansion, that is not
true anym ore,” he said.

Advocates of various causes plead for more money
m andated streamlining plans. A coalition of business executives supporting
higher education says A llen’s plan is inadequate.
The business group drew a sharp rebuke from Allen, who said in his State of
the Com monwealth speech that even his 7-year-old daughter understands Santa
Claus can’t bring her everything she wants.
Brian H ubbard of Russell County, chairm an of the G eorge M ason University
Student Senate, told the m oney com m ittees that A llen’s analogy rem inded him
of a Christmas story his grandfather used to tell.
“You see, when my grandfather was a child, Santa didn’t bring toys or dolls on
Christmas morning, but shoes and m ittens—basic things the children needed to
m ake it through the year,” H ubbard said. “My friends, education is not toys and
dolls, it is m ittens and shoes.”
R obert Pace, a student at Virginia C om m onw ealth University, urged the
com m ittees to hold down tuition and spend m ore on faculty salaries and
technology.
“It only takes a firm com m itm ent and a willingness to appropriate the
necessary funds,” he said.
Wesley Wilson, who owns a small business in N ew port News, said that as a

'BioDome': A surprisingly good time ... and the CD was good, too!
By Jennifer Casey
Assistant Lifestyle Editor
Pauly Shore, eternal college kid,
is back in a theater near you with
his surprisingly entertaining film
“BioDome,” a comic approach to
dealing with environmental issues,
which also stars Stephen Baldwin
(“Threesome”) and former Aussie
pop princess Kylie Minogue.
Bud (Shore)
and
Doyle
(Baldwin) mistake the BioDome, a
synthetic “perfect environment”
lab in the Arizona desert, for a big
mall and sneak in to use the
bathroom. Next thing you know,
Bud and Doyle are sealed in the
BioDome with a team of five
scientists who do not appreciate
the fact that they have to spend the
next 365 days sealed up with some
slack-punks who still think they’re
in a mall.
In an effort to prove to their
girlfriends, played by Joey Adams
and Teresa Hill (who got her start
in the short-lived FOX-TV drama
“Models, Inc.”), that they can party
just as hard as the college frat boys
that Monique (Adams) and Jen
(Hill) know, Bud and Doyle find a
way to sneak people into the
BioDome.
Bud and Doyle’s mega-bash
destroys the “perfect” environment
inside the BioDome, as well as
destroying their relationships with
the girls. It also causes the head
scientist in the BioDome five, Dr.
Noah Faulkner, who is played by
William Atherton, to go crazy and
disappear within the depths of the
Dome.
Rather
than
let
their
environmental faux pas ruin the
BioDome project, Bud and Doyle
urge the remaining four scientists
to push on with their effort to

return to 100 percent homeostasis.
Doyle goes as far as to lock the
door they snuck the partiers in and
swallow the key.
Meanwhile, the unshaven,
scuzzy looking Dr. Faulkner is
slithering through the bowels of the
BioDome, constructing a plan to
blow the place up.
On their last day in the Dome,
Bud, Doyle and the team of
scientists reach their goal of
restoring 100 percent homeostasis
in the BioDome and, of course, Dr.
Faulkner tries to execute his plan to
shred the place. Bud and Doyle
predictably save the day, rescue the
Dome and get their girlfriends
back.
Shore is not noted for his roles
as a serious, dramatic actor, but his
obscure sense of humor and off­
beat talent, along with Baldwin’s
uncanny resemblance to (not to
mention the attitude and manners
of), oh say, the Beavis half of
Beavis and Butthead, make
“BioDome” a sure winner in the
comedy category.

I can’t decide whether 1 liked the movie “BioDome” or the BioDome soundtrack
better!

(Hill)

Happy belated New Year, SIUE. How many
o f you have reneged on your New Year’s
resolutions already? Not me. I learned not to
make them, so I won’t disappoint myself. One
of the major resolutions students make is to
graduate within four or five years.
I have noticed that this university has six
levels: freshmen, beginning sophomore, middle
sophomore, almost-not-a-sophomore-anymore
sophomore, junior and finally, senior.
Today I would like to dwell upon the three
levels that may not be familiar to students from
other states or universities.

If you read my review of the movie, you’ll probably be able to tell that I got a big
kick out of it. The CD, however, got me even more pumped.
Remember the 80’s cult classic “The Safety Dance” by Men Without Hats? This
one-hit wonder is back on the BioDome soundtrack, but has been re-engineered into a 90’s
“biomix” version. It truly brings back memories!
Also featured on the soundtrack are two tunes from the group Fourth Grade
Nothing. “Adirectional” makes up the opening credits of the movie, and the group also puts an
interesting spin on the old Kim Wylde tune “Kids in America.”
You cannot imagine how excited I was when I opened up this CD and read on the
jacket that “Don’t Wanna Behave” (by my all-time favorite punk-ska-pop band, Dance Hall
Crashers) was included in the soundtrack. And yes folks, when the song came on during the
movie, I was actually singing it under my breath.
Tunes from Wax, Magnapop, X-Members, Time Zone, Bow Wow Wow, Camper
Van Beethoven, Stealers Wheel and The Rugburns are also highlighted on the soundtrack.
I can honestly say that the BioDome soundtrack should be included in the CD
collection of anyone who loves punk, ska, techno or alternative music. There’s a song on this
CD for everyone.
from other universities. With horror, these transfer students find out that all o f their
previously taken courses are for naught.
Social scale: Hey, you’re moving right on up, you have probably been to some
parties, joined some student organizations or have become a Greek. I recently did this
myself. For some, even the goal o f getting a tattoo has been already achieved. Some
are not really serious about relationships, but neither are they about a major.

Sophomore jinx
By Darryl Howlett

Beginning sophomore: This level is for those lucky souls who have made it out of
all the AD (academic development) classes, both math and English. However, this
also includes those who have taken courses such as University 112. Oooohhhh scary—do you get credit for that class?
Social scale: You’ve probably went to your first party by now, but if you haven’t,
fear not, because this level usually lasts for a year.
Middle o f the road sophomore: These experts have been on campus long enough
to know when to stay in the UC and when not to. This is usually wjiere students get
stuck changing their majors maybe one, two and, Oh my God!, three times. Try to get
out of this level as quick as possible. The university seems to love these students who
have tons of hours and nowhere to go. Also, this is were the university sticks students

Sophomore, sophomore: Hallelujah! Well, congratulations, you finally made it at
least through English 101 and the common final is a nightmare of the past. Now you
can think seriously about a major and what the future has in store. But this is a tricky
level. Make sure the university has all your hours correct and in order. Beware that
this is also when all those parking tickets seem to catch up to you. The university
knows that after making it to junior land your stay will not be so long. Keep pressing
on to make it to the promised land.
Social scale: By now you probably have a major and a relationship to boot. Be
aware, however, that after attending parties for two-and-a-half years, the tendency is
to fall prey to trying new and dangerous things like sky diving, bungee jumping and
looking at the Home Shopping Network. This is when you really need to be strong.
After these terrible, long, hard levels the world is yours. Junior and senior year
should be a fun time when your priorities are set, and you will have the knowledge
that you will no longer be giving the university money. That is, o f course, unless five
years down the line someone calls you about your involvement in a phone scam.

Lifestyle Reporter
Compilation and tribute albums have been
popping up a lot lately. It seems that bands can’t
wait to honor the bands that have helped
influence their music.
Lately there have been tributes to Led
Zeppelin, Willie Nelson, the Carpenters and
XTC. Many compilation albums have been
produced around common themes. The MTV
Party to Go series is on its eighth album. The
Hempilation compilation was dedicated to the
legalization of marijuana.
There is even an album with 12 different
versions o f “Stairway to Heaven.” (This is one
for any music enthusiast.)
The reason these albums are so abundant is
the fact that cover songs are fun to do. The band
is able to record songs that it may never get to do
normally.
One o f the latest in a string o f compilations is
Saturday M orning Cartoons’ Greatest Hits.
This is an album completely dedicated to the
theme songs of cartoons and other kiddie shows.
Executive Producer Ralph Sail came up with
the idea for the album. Sail wanted to pair theme
songs from the cartoons he grew up watching
with artists who could turn the songs into
signature numbers for the band. The result is an
album that is sure to bring back childhood
memories to any member of the “Generation XSlacker” generation.
The trip down memory lane starts as soon as
you read the list o f songs. The 19 tracks result in

over 65 minutes o f music, so you’re assured
you’ll get your money’s worth out of this one.
The album is full of highlights, such as
Matthew Sweet performing the original theme
from “Scooby-Doo.” It sounds as though the
song was written for him.
Frente! does an amazing job of “Open Up
Your Heart and Let the Sun Shine In.” If I didn’t
know better, I would swear that this is the
original version from the “Flintstones.”
My personal favorites are Wax doing a
version of “Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy” on speed,
Dig covering the “Fat Albert” theme and the
Violent Femmes singing “Eep Opp Ork Ah-Ah
(Means I Love You)” from “The Jetsons.”
Other artists include Juliana Hatfield with
Tanya Donnelly, Liz Phair with Material Issue,
Helmet, the Ramones, the Reverend Horton
Heat and more.
Only one song should have been left off the
album. The song is “Go Speed Racer, Go.” The
song is a great, but Sponge has mangled it so
that it is very painful to listen to. I now have to
program that track out of rotation when I play
this album, which is a shame because I love
“Speed Racer.” This is just another reason to hate
Sponge.
This album is just fun—plain and simple.
The lyrics to all of the songs are included, but
you won’t need them. You’ll be surprised at just
how much you remember. If you’re feeling really
frisky, go out and buy the video. You can plug it
into the VCR, grab a big bowl of cereal and park
your butt on the couch because it’s always
Saturday morning somewhere.

Lady Cougars use balanced attack
to split a pair on tough road trip
By Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
O ne day it might be Terri Evans leading the
Lady Cougars to victory then the following day it
could be Alicia Harkins, or any other player the
next game. This trend becam e quite apparent
during the ladies recent road trip.
Last Thursday the Cougars defeated WisconsinParkside 72-50 in a G reat Lake Valley Conference
game, but then lost to St. Joseph’s 84-80 on
Saturday in another conference outing to take
their record to 10-4 overall and 5-3 in the GLVC.
In both games the scoring was well balanced
with players taking turns leading the team in points
each night.
Against W isconsin-Parkside the Cougars posted
four players in double figures with Evans taking
the game ball with 16 points. H arkins had 14 points
and six rebounds, while Am y Tuetken contributed
seven points and eight rebounds.
Freshm an Kim Lowe played well off the bench
with 13 points and six rebounds.
The Cougars took a tough defeat Saturday and
head coach Wendy H edberg com m ented on her
team s play.
“We played for about 30 m inutes and we started
Jeremy Paschall/A/esf/e
struggling offensively and defensively. Then we let
Sophomore Alicia Harkins and the Lady Cougars are
them score at will,” H edberg said in her office
10-4 after splitting a pair of recent games on the road. W ednesday afternoon. “It was the first ten m inutes

that hurt us in the second half and then the last ten
m inutes we started playing and got back in the
game.”
The Cougars had the chance to either tie or go
ahead with a three pointer, but they wanted to
work the ball and look for the good shot with 29
seconds left.
Evans drove down the m iddle pulled up for a
short jum per and it rim m ed out. The Cougars
reb o u n d ed m issed two tip-ins and they were
forced to foul when the Lady Pumas finally pulled
down the rebound. They then made both free
throws to put the game out of reach.
Alicia H arkins led the Cougars with 22 points
with Phillips close behind at 19. Then it was
Tuetken (14), Evans (11) and Lowe (10).
In the past couple of games Phillips has been
turning it on offensively with a 19 point, seven
rebound game against St. Joseph’s and a 14 point
six rebound game against Wisconsin-Parkside.
“We talked to her and told her she just has to be
m ore aggressive and take the ball to the hole more
and stop relying just on the three,” H edberg said.
The Cougars are now getting ready to face
O akland City tonight at the Vadalebene Center
starting at 7 pm.
“I ’m m ore concerned about us than them. We
just need to play good defense and pick up early on
there game plan,” H edberg said. “If we play hard
and with intensity we should be fine.”

The Cougar wrestling team hosted the third annual SIUE Invitational Saturday at the Vadalabene Center.

SIUE grapplers finish seventh in own
tournament-Carter only champion
Todd Spann
Assistant Sports Editor
The SIU E wrestling team hosted an invitational over the weekend where some individual
scores are m ore notew orthy than the team scores.
Overall the Cougars finished 7th in the 10 team tournam ent with one C ougar taking first place
in his respected weight class.
Jason C arter in the 190 pound weight class defeated all of his opponents to win the top prize.
H e beat A ndy Tubbs from W isconsin-Parkside in the cham pionship match.
“C arter has been wrestling b etter and better each m atch he wrestles in,” head coach Larry
Kristoff said in his office W ednesday afternoon.
There may of been a little revenge that factored in to S IU E ‘s Jayson Querciagrossa defeating
R andy R oark of Missouri Valley in the third-place m atch at 142 pounds.
Last W ednesday night, the Cougars lost to M issouri Valley 30-6 and Q uerciagrossa also lost to
R oark 8-6. So he had a second chance against R oark and m ade the m ost of it in his 1-0 defeat of
the nationally ranked opponent.
“Jayson didn’t wrestle very well his first m atch, but came back and beat R oark and R oark is
a good one,” Kristoff said.
126-pound B rian A nderson also took third place for the Cougars as he defeated Jeff
Showalter of Missouri Valley. The one loss A nderson took was to the eventual cham pion David
Barden of Tennessee-Chattanooga.
“A nderson wrestled very well and his only loss was to the num ber three guy in the nation so
he wrestled fine,” Kristoff said.
All in all Kristoff said some w restled good and some didn’t.
Tennessee-Chattanooga finished first in team scores with a 76.5 followed by C entral
Oklahom a with 69. Wisconsin Parkside (55), E astern Illinois (50.5) and then Missouri Valley
(39.5) rounded out the top five.
In the Missouri Valley dual m eet Chris M cElwee and M ark Ward were the only winners for
the Cougars and the team loss dropped their record to 0-2. The o th er loss came against Illinois.
The Cougars are now getting ready for the C entral Missouri State University Invitational on
Jan. 20, in W arrensburg, Missouri.
