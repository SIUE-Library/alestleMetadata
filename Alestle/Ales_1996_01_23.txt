By Melanie Adams
Assistant News Editor
O n Jan. 9 the Illinois Board of H igher
E ducation (IB H E ) endorsed tuition

w ere ad o p ted last fall by university
governing boards. While the increase did
affect the tuition at SIU E by 4.7 percent,

“T he university is keeping tuition as
low as possible, even with the increase”
Samuel Smith, director of University News

T he four-year plan approved last year
by the SIU B oard of Trustees entailed an
$86.40 increase in undergraduate tuition

Logan grad accused of lacing brownies
A John A. Logan College graduate has been accused of giving one of his instructors marijuana-laced
brownies.
Kevin Klink, 35, of Murphysboro was charged in Williamson County with unlawful tampering of food,
drugs or cosmetics and unlawful delivery of marijuana.
Klink gave two of the brownies to a part-time sociology teacher last May, authorities said.
The teacher did not get sick, but two other instructors she shared the brownies with had to be taken to
the hospital.
Klink graduated from the college with an associate degree in May, said Robert Mees, vice president of
instruction.

CBS rejects GOP request to air response day later
CBS became the second network to turn down a request from GOP leaders, who wanted their
response to President Bill Clinton’s State of the Union speech to air a day later in prime time.
The network considers it in the public’s interest to air both the president’s speech and the GOP
response on Tuesday night, Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News, said Sunday.
ABC turned down the Republicans’ request last week; NBC has yet to respond.

Investigators for a U.N. war crimes tribunal have begun to unearth the skeletons of genocide victims
from a mass grave outside a church in Kibuye.
Human rights groups believe that about 4,000 people seeking shelter in a Kibuye church were killed
and their bodies stacked inside the building during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. The bodies were
buried at several sites near the church, they say.

The new $1,928 annual

Other institutions’ annual

assessment is $110,500.
“Students will always feel

However, the university has

Sexual harassment case against
President Clinton to proceed
(A P)—As if there w eren’t enough potential for friction betw een pillow
mates in the W hite House, a federal court has delivered another reason to
m ake life for the first couple interesting in a m iserable sort of way.
The court ruled that a form er A rkansas state em ployee, Paula Jones, can
proceed with her sexual harassm ent case against the president. <None>
Jones, who was a secretary in the A rkansas Statehouse, sued the president
in 1994, contending that a state trooper took her to a hotel room when
Clinton was governor. Clinton, it is alleged, said he w anted to m eet her.
Once there, she claims Clinton dropped his pants and m ade crude advances.
Charges involving sexual im propriety have dogged Clinton since he
entered national politics.
The president was widely ridiculed w hen the charge surfaced almost two
years ago. But the issue had subsided until (the) 2-to-l ruling by an
appellate court.
The president’s lawyer will appeal. C linton’s lawyer argues that the
president should be im m une to civil lawsuits while in office for behavior
that allegedly occurred before he was elected.
One would be surprised, however, if the Suprem e C ourt rejected this
rationale by the appellate court.
“The president, like all other governm ent officials, is subject to the same
laws that apply to all other m em bers of o u r society. A sitting president is
not im mune from civil suits for his unofficial acts.”

Hillary Rodham Clinton target
of two dismissal investigations
(A P)—Hillary R odham Clinton currently is the target of two
congressional inquiries. T he H ouse is investigating the dismissals of seven
travel office workers who were replaced with w orkers led by a cousin of the
president. A Senate com m ittee is looking into the collapse of M adison
G uaranty Savings and Loan, which R odham C linton’s Rose Law Firm
represented.
The first lady has consistently downplayed her role in both issues, but
docum ents have revealed that she apparently played a m ajor part in each.
Rodham Clinton told Congress m em bers last year that her role was
“m inim al” and that an associate, Richard Massey, did most of the work. But
Massey recently testified that he can’t recall much about the dealings, or any
conversations he might have had with R odham Clinton. Billing records that
miraculously appeared (this m onth) show that R odham Clinton sent
Madison 22 separate bills for w ork she did on their behalf.
She also said she w asn’t involved in the travel office mess that took place
in 1993. The W hite H ouse fired seven long-time em ployees, charging they
had misused funds and asked the FBI to investigate them. A fter the
allegations were found to be false, m ost of the fired em ployees were rehired
and the Clintons were forced to m ake a public apology.
Memos subm itted to the H ouse com m ittee revealed that the first lady
essentially spearheaded the dismissals. David Watkins, who at the time was
the W hite H ouse director of adm inistration, produced a m em o stating that
R odham Clinton w anted the staffers fired.
“We knew that there would be hell to pay if we failed to take swift and
decisive action in conform ity with the first lady’s wishes,” the memo states.
A chronology of events from form er Chief of Staff Mack M cLarty and notes
from an interview with Fan Dozier, an em ployee of the A rkansas firm that
replaced the fired workers, back up W atkins’ beliefs.
So does the first lady simply have a bad memory, or has she been lying?
Only she knows for sure. But W hite H ouse efforts to block the
investigations have led many to believe that the Clintons m ust have
som ething to hide.

Abraham Lincoln deserves
holiday just like Dr. King
I would like to begin by saying that 1 do not consider myself a racist person.
It’s just the topic that I choose to write about might be taken the wrong way.
Last M onday we received a holiday in com m em oration of the birth of slain
civil rights leader Dr. M artin L uther King Jr. The question I raise is, “Why has
the man who freed the slaves been oveilooked?” The man of whom I speak is
A braham Lincoln. Lincoln was responsible for freeing the slaves 100 years
before King’s “I H ave a D ream ” speech.
How is it we honor the man who w asn’t born in Illinois, yet the man who
spent the majority of his life in this state receives no recognition. Isn’t this the
“Land of Lincoln?”
I ’m not saying we need to do away with the M artin L uther King Jr. holiday.
I just w onder why we don ’t give the same recognition to a m an who started 100
years earlier.

SIUE fans continue to amaze
Amazing.
Rem arkable.
Astonishing.
Those are only a few words 1 can
think of off-hand to describe the
turnout at Saturday’s m en’s and
w om en’s basketball games at the
V adalabene Center.
To have any kind of crowd at a
w om en’s basketball game is simply
amazing, considering that I do n ’t think
many people here know there is a
w om en’s basketball team . Hello, there
is a w om en’s team and they are pretty
good. To hear a crowd cheering for
them had to m ake them feel good and
play a little harder.
A nd for those who didn’t know
there was a team , or just haven’t
decided to come out and support these
ladies, you might want to check them
out and jum p on the Cougar
bandwagon.
But actually, I am m ore amazed at
the size of the crowd there to support
S IU E ’s m en’s basketball team.
Quincy University is much hated by
some SIU E fans—so I was sort of
expecting a decent crowd, and not the

kind o f turnout it generated.
F or the first time since I have been
at SIU E, the V adalabene C enter
actually felt like a hom e court.
Like Sports E ditor Eli Savoie said,
“ It actually had a college basketball
atm osphere.”
Every three-point attem pt by Jason
Holm es had the crowd on the edge of
their seats, ready to jum p up when the
ball went through the rim touching
nothing but the bottom of the net.
Every hard-fought rebound and putback by undersized Ronnie H enderson
kept the crowd w ondering how much
higher he could jum p.
Only those of you who attend these
games can appreciate the sideline
antics of Coach M argenthaler during
every game.
W hether these team s win or lose is
not really an issue. Sure, we would like
them to win every game, but th a t’s not
going to happen. W hat we really need
is for fans to continue to support these
programs.
Keep it up SIU E. I hope w e’ll see
you in the stands for the rest of this
season.

Louisiana’s single-board plan draws black opposition
T he B oard o f G overnors w ould, in effect,
perform the same role as the B oard of Trustees,
which oversaw the other three boards. All of its
m em bers would be appointed by the governor.
F o n ten o t said he did not think the p la n ’s

Southern University system to Louisiana’s black
population.
“I don’t think the white com m unity realizes what
Southern has done for this state and the role that we
can play in the future,” F ontenot said.
F ontenot expressed concern that the single-board
proposal also might have negative effects on the
recent settlem ent in the long-running federal lawsuit
over the desegregation o f L ouisiana’s public
colleges.
Late Friday, Foster said it is “too

occupy the research category, as the state’s flagship

A second class w ould include S outhern

part of the LSU system— and Louisiana Tech.

including Southern U niversity at New O rleans,
would be in the third category, with the state’s
com m unity

com prising

final
classification.
O gden’s proposal, which is to be fine-tuned over
the next two weeks before it is presented to the
governor, calls for all the m em bers of the board to be
appointed at-large and to serve eight- to 10-year
terms.
State H igher E ducation C om m issioner Larry
Crain said Friday that he prefers O gden’s single­
board plan to ano th er proposal, suggested last week
by the governor’s chief of staff, that would have
abolished the state B oard of Regents.
T hat proposal would have created one board to
govern LSU , the LSU Law C enter, the LSU
A gricultural C en ter and the M edical C enter; a
second board to govern Southern University’s Baton
R ouge cam pus, along with its law cen ter and
agricultural center; and a third board to govern all
o th er state universities.
The problem with the chief of staff’s proposal was
that it did not provide any board to coordinate
college program s and higher education in general,
Crain said.
Any m ajor changes in the state’s current fourb o ard stru ctu re w ould req u ire a constitutional
am endm ent.
Rep. Kip H olden, D -B aton Rouge, whose district
includes S outhern’s main campus in B aton Rouge,
said he did not like the sound of the plan. “It would
cause a lot o f confusion as people within the
university system jockey to get the upper hand,” he
said.

College newspaper reporter
wants to see lawmakers' e-mail
D E N V E R (A P)— A college new spaper rep o rter has sent letters to Gov. Roy R om er and
state Sen. Charles D uke asking to see their e-mail messages sent for the first 16 days of 1996.
Becky O ’Guin, a journalism student at M etro State College of Denver, cited the Colorado
Open Records law in her requests. O ’G uin writes for the Capitol R eporter, a student
new spaper that covers the legislature.
D uke, R -M onum ent, said he has always com plied with open records laws, but he was taken
aback by the request to turn over his electronic messages from Jan. 1-16.
“I’m disturbed by it,” D uke said.
R om er’s press secretary, Jim C arpenter, said his office is “looking at all the issues, all the
options.”
Lawm akers said Friday they would get a legal opinion on w hether they m ust disclose their
electronic messages, and they may pass legislation to m ake sure their messages have some
protection of privacy.

A bill by Sen. Paul Weissmann, R-Louisville, to m ake e-mail as privileged as telephone
conversations died in a Senate com m ittee, but a som ewhat stronger bill still rests in the House.
Senate M ajority Leader Jeff Wells, R -C olorado Springs, said he believes e-mail is privileged
inform ation unless it is specifically identified as public inform ation under existing law.
But O ’Guin is not backing down, saying she is just trying to find out how much public
business is conducted through e-mail.
“If they’re using e-mail to send memos back and forth discussing public business, I see that
as public record,” she said. “Most of them d on’t (have e-mail), but about 30 people have
software that allows them to send e-mail back and forth.”

Court says college newspaper
must turn over photos of fracas
Spring Break Paehages
ST. PA U L (A P )—T he U niversity of M innesota stu d en t new spaper m ust turn over
unpublished photographs to a judge in a pending criminal case, the M innesota C ourt of A ppeals
has ruled.
The 2-1 ruling issued Friday reiterates an earlier C ourt of A ppeals ruling and rejects
arguments that media freedom s are threatened by law enforcem ent subpoenas for unpublished
inform ation gathered by journalists.
T he M innesota D aily’s attorney, M arshall H. Tanick, said the new spaper may appeal to the
state Suprem e Court.
The earlier ruling said neither state law nor the C onstitution protects m edia organizations
from court orders to turn over unpublished pictures for judges to inspect in criminal cases.
Friday’s ruling compels the new spaper to turn over the photographs even though the trial
judge who initially requested them has since changed his mind.
Daily editor Michelle Am es said she will go to jail before handing over the pictures.
“I can only say that we are all sad about this,” said Am es, 26. “But our position has not
changed and will not change.”
H ennepin C ounty District Judge John Stanoch had requested to review the photos privately
in his cham bers to determ ine w hether they should be entered into evidence in a criminal case
stemming from a fight at the university.
In D ecem ber, Stanoch reversed his position, ruling that the Daily staff was within its rights to
refuse the H ennepin C ounty attorney’s dem and to turn over the unpublished photographs.
But the C ourt of A ppeals on Friday said Stanoch had no authority to modify its earlier ruling
ordering the D aily to turn over the pictures.
The pictures w ere taken during a clash in O ctober 1993 betw een a group called the
Progressive Students’ O rganization and a m an nam ed D aniel Simmer.
A uthorities charged Kieran K nutson with two felony counts of assault for allegedly striking
Simmer. W itnesses gave conflicting accounts as to w hether Simmer was wearing brass knuckles
at the time— an issue that becam e central to K nutson’s claim o f self-defense.
A ssistant H ennepin C ounty A ttorney Paul Scoggin, who handled the appeal, said the court
properly balanced com peting interests.
“We have to balance the state’s interest in trying to figure out w hether a crime occurred and
journalists’ equally legitim ate interest in protecting unpublished inform ation,” he said.
H e said the decision should be m ade on a case-by-case basis, and that in some cases the county
attorney’s office would not support asking for unpublished inform ation.
The Daily has argued that instead of seeking the unpublished pictures, prosecutors should
interview the many witnesses to the fight.
“This was a public rally that was attended by hundreds of people,” A m es said. “With that
am ount of individuals, they should have enough eyewitness accounts to provide the inform ation
they need w ithout co-opting news organizations.”
Scoggin said the witnesses w ere not disinterested parties, unlike the Daily photographer.
Tanick argued th at m edia organizations have privilege to resist subpoenas from law
enforcem ent agencies seeking unpublished inform ation. News m edia argue that such subpoenas
can cause reporters to be viewed as an arm of the law, which has a “chilling effect” on newsgathering and therefore restricts freedom of expression.
K eiran’s trial currently is under way.
Scoggin said the prosecution likely will ask the judge to review the pictures M onday before it
rests its case. H e said prosecutors probably would recom m end that the judge hold the new spaper
in contem pt if it fails to produce the photos.

Hallucinogen is being looked at as cure for addiction
ALBA N Y , N.Y. (A P )— In the 1960s, a m an took
a new drug at a party hoping to get high.
Instead, H ow ard L otsof said he took ibogaine
and becam e “c u re d ” o f his addiction. H e ’s
d ed icated his life to getting the illegal drug
approved as a treatm ent for addicts.
T he controversial drug has draw n skepticism from
th e g o v ern m en t and has b een slow in being
developed into an approved treatm ent for addicts in
the U nited States.
Now, an A lbany M edical College professor and a
U niversity o f V erm ont chem ist, w ho have
developed a derivative that they claim elim inates
som e of the d ru g ’s dangerous side effects, say they
might be close.
The natural hallucinogen taken from shrubs in
A frica could som eday cure addictions to heroin,
cocaine and even nicotine and alcohol, according to
its proponents.
“It started out as som ething very quirky,” said
Stanley D. Glick, the chairm an of the departm ent of
Pharm acology and N euroscience at A lbany Med.
“I was intrigued mainly by the claim he (Lotsof)
m ade that if you take the drug once o r m aybe two
or three times and then you’ve lost your craving for
drugs for m onths, years, forever ... the claim was
m ore outrageous even than any other,” Glick said in
his laboratory.
“I thought I’d give it to a few rats—rats that were
trained to self adm inister m orphine,” he said. “A nd,
lo and b eh o ld , it decreased m orphine self­
adm inistration and we becam e m ore interested in
it.”
T he problem was that in rats it produced trem ors,

and at high doses, killed their brain cells.
A fter years of research, Glick and M artin K uehne
of the U niversity o f V erm ont have found a
derivative of ibogaine that they say suppresses the
craving for drugs, but doesn’t produce trem ors.
T heir hope is that this will help develop a less toxic
treatm ent.
K uehne said the derivative may help dispel some
of the fears that skeptics have o f ibogaine.
“T he com pounds were free from these bizarre
effects,” K uehne said.
K uehne said h e ’s hopeful that tests on hum ans
could begin this year. But he did point out that a
person would really have to w ant to quit. “If they
want to not be addicted, I think it could be a
com plete cure.”
People seeking treatm ent would undergo an 18h o u r ordeal in a hospital afte r taking a pill
containing the derivative of ibogaine, Glick said.
Some people who have experienced the treatm ent
describe it as watching a movie about their lives.
Lotsof said they see repressed m em ories, then
th ere’s a cognitive evaluation of o n e’s life and then
all “psycho-activity” is reduced.
Lotsof said the results often cause narcotic
withdrawal and allows one to come to term s with his
or her narcotic abuse and quit.
Ibogaine appears to inhibit dopam ine, the
n eu ro tran sm itter that is released by m orphine,
heroin or cocaine creating euphoric feelings.
“I t’s no longer a lark,” Glick said.
“If I can stop one individual from using cocaine or
heroin, I ’d feel pretty good,” Glick said.
A n advisory panel told the Food and Drug
A dm inistration in 1993 that it should go ahead and
allow hum an trials on a case-by-case basis.

A t the University o f Miami, lim ited tests on
hum ans to determ ine the safety of ibogaine are
being conducted.
L otsof has conducted his own experim ents with
the drug on hum ans out of the country, som etim es
in hotels and som etim es with grave results.
“A long the way, th ere’s been a few deaths,” said
Dr. A lan I. Trachtenberg, a medical officer with the
N ational Institute on D rug Abuse. While what
caused two deaths cannot be directly linked to
ibogaine, it has Trachtenberg worried.
“It gets them skittish,” Lotsof said of the deaths.
The testing outside the U nited States is now done
in hospitals and the screening for candidates is m ore
intense, he said.
T rachtenberg said the drug is used in G abon, a
West A frican nation, where it’s believed th at by
chewing the root of T abernanthe iboga, from which
ibogaine is derived, one can speak with ancestors.
T rachtenberg said the person chewing the root
occasionally ends up dying.
Still, T rach ten b erg said th ere isn’t enough
inform ation yet that proves ibogaine is that useful
or promising.
“T h ere’s a very long way to go,” Trachtenberg
said.
“It m ay o r may not be an im portant drug,”
Trachtenberg said. “True believers claim it’s a very
im portant drug.”
“W hen som eone comes along and says we can cure
addiction, you have to have a healthy dose of
skepticism. You have to be suspicious, not to say
this isn’t going to happen.”

Big second half helps
SIUE roll by Quincy
By Brett Licata
Sports Reporter

Jeremy Paschall/A/esf/e

Quincy's Taron Pickett cuts off Jason Holmes' path to the basket during Saturday nights contest.
Holmes poured in a season high 38 points, but the Cougars fell 1 12 -1 10 in double overtime.

Even though their contest against O akland City on Thursday
was canceled because of icy w eather conditions, the SIU E Lady
Cougars were heating the Vadalabene C enter court up with a
70-59 victory over Quincy on Saturday evening.
This G reat Lakes Valley C onference win took their overall
record to 11-4 and im proved their GLVC record to 6-3.
The Cougars started out flat in the first half falling victim to
a stifling Quincy defense. H ead coach Wendy H edberg credited
the opposing squad for a fine display of intim idation.
D ow n ten points at halftim e, coach H edberg told her
Cougars to pick up their intensity level in the second half and
they responded.
“We came out and pressed to kind of get us moving a little
bit. We got back the ten point deficit that we w ere down and just
w ent from there,” H edberg said.
While shooting over 50 percent in the second half, the
Cougars’ perim eter defense came together. They outscored
Quincy 45-24 in the final half. The Cougars tried to mix up their
defenses to keep the opposition off balance.
“W e’ve been struggling lately with post defense. We tried to
work on switching them up a little bit,” H edberg said.
The full-court pressure gave the Ladies the turnovers they
needed to rally back for the victory.
Similar to their o th er games this season, there was a wide
variety of contributors to the Lady C ougar attack. Terri Evans
led the Cougars with 19 points and 5 steals. Kim Lowe and
Alicia H arkins threw in 16 and 15 points respectively. Amy
Tuetken added 13 points with 5 steals and 8 rebounds.
Next up for the Lady Cougars is a battle with Bellarmine,
who have won seven in a row and are tied for the num ber one
spot in the GLVC.
The game is set to tip-off at 5:30 p.m., Thursday night in the
V adalabene Center.
